Or can you succeed where the Panzers failed, driving through to the sea and changing history? Play single battles, linked operations, or even the Grand campaign simulating all six crucial days of fighting. With 35 linked battlefields and historically accurate formations and units, strategic choices are as important as tactical prowess. New features of long-range interdiction, strategic high ground and adverse weather conditions bring an insight into the challenges faced by those who commanded both sides in this pivotal WW2 battle. Command your forces on the strategic level, issuing orders to battalion or regimental-sized units to attack or defend, and allocate air or artillery support. Then fight out the resulting engagements in a highly-detailed, real-time simulation of World War II tactical combat. The results of the tactical battle determine who controls each area, and where they can move at the strategic level. For the Allies the Normandy landings of June were followed by two months of hard fighting in difficult terrain against a tenacious German defense. But in late July the U.S. Armys Operation Cobra has finally created a decisive breach in the weakened German line.

Faced with the choice between retreat and last-ditch counter-attack, the Germans struggle to assemble a panzer force for one more charge.

Having already based characters and worlds on the so-called next generation of consoles (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii) and a variety of handheld systems (Game Gear, PSP, DS), the series takes a decidedly retro turn in Victory, with the main character Neptune being transported to an alternate, 1980s version of Gamindustri, where the country of Lowee (Nintendo) is preparing for an invasion from Leanbox (Microsoft). Because Victory is set in the past, there are new goddesses in charge of the four main kingdoms in Gamindusti, and like Neptune and her Console Patron Unit (CPU) alter-ego Purple Heart, each of the new goddesses can transform into more powerful characters when the need arises. In order to return to her home, Neptune must work with the goddesses to foil the schemes of a mysterious group known as the Seven Sages. As always, players can visit towns to convene with party members, shop, and get new missions, while the dungeon crawling has been slightly altered to allow secondary characters the chance to go on scouting missions and acquire special items. Gamers can freely explore the 3D environments, and they can also move around the battlefield once they've been engaged in combat. Each character has an attack radius, and players can strategically position their fighter to hit multiple foes with each strike. Gamers can unleash high-strike rush attacks, heavy-damage power attacks, or defense-busting break attacks, and special finishing moves can be placed in any of four different attack slots.""]",NIS America,"['>#57,071 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#1,768 in Video Games > PlayStation 3 > Games']",$45.00,Video Games,B00BMH3SZY

But a powerful storm splits their ship in half, and when the survivors wash onto shore they are greeted by dangerous terrain, fierce wildlife, and fortune-seeking scavengers.

To reach that end, gamers can make use of a variety of upgradeable weapons and tools, including torches, a bow, an ax, and a host of guns. The action mostly takes place in open, multi-path locations, with players using newly acquired tools to access loot and treasure maps in previously unavailable areas. The open layout also lends itself to multiplayer action, which pits groups of survivors against groups of scavengers in a variety of modes across five trap-filled maps.""]",Square Enix,"['>#43,614 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#1,469 in Video Games > PlayStation 3 > Games']",$44.95,Video Games,B00BPDACJA

Panzer Campaigns: Moscow '41,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games']","{'ASIN:': 'B000BQM5OW', ' Date first listed on Amazon:': 'October 12, 2005'}","[""Moscow '41 features the familiar Panzer Campaigns interface and game scale where 1 hexes represents 1 km and a 2 hour game turn. The map area encompasses over 150,000 hexes (438 x 385) which is larger than the Kursk Map by almost 1/3rd. The area covers from 15km north of Kalinin in the north to 80 km south of Tula. 27 Scenarios are included covering both Fall and Winter fighting with two major Campaign Periods - 2 Oct until the on set of the muddy weather brought the offensive to a halt. - 15 Nov until the drive ended on the outskirts of Moscow.\n\nCampaign scenarios are included for both time periods as well as smaller scenarios covering specific actions and what if situations. OOB & Scenario editors are included which allow players to customize the game to their desires. Theres no limit on the scenarios that can be created and the sub-map feature allows the main map to be chopped up into the specific size that best fits the situation. Moscow 41 brings new engine changes to the series which enhance the campaign being portrayed, and as always, all new features will be rolled out for free to the previous titles in the series:\n\nAdded new Frozen Penalty rules (see Environment section of Users Manual). (Added to account for the lack of preparation the Germans made for this first winter in Russia. So as the German player you will battle the weather as well as a growing number of Russian Units.) Change so that units with Hard Attack values of range 0 only have those attack values affect assaults under the optional Alternate Assault rule and not default assaults. Changes to AT Guns including no ZOC, ability to retreat after assault, and increased disruption against hard vehicles. Changes to Heavy AA Guns including no ZOC and increased disruption against hard vehicles. Moscow 41 provides multiple play options including play against the computer AI, Play by e-mail (PBEM), LAN & Internet live play, and two player hotseat.""]",HPS Simulations,[],".a-box-inner{background-color:#fff}#alohaBuyBoxWidget .selected{background-color:#fffbf3;border-color:#e77600;box-shadow:0 0 3px rgba(228,121,17,.5)}#alohaBuyBoxWidget .contract-not-available{color:gray}#aloha-cart-popover .aloha-cart{height:auto;overflow:hidden}#aloha-cart-popover #aloha-cartInfo{float:left}#aloha-cart-popover #aloha-cart-details{float:right;margin-top:1em}#aloha-cart-popover .deviceContainer{width:160px;float:left;padding-right:10px;border-right:1px solid #ddd}#aloha-cart-popover li:last-child{border-right:0}#aloha-cart-popover .aloha-device-title{height:3em;overflow:hidden}#aloha-cart-popover .aloha-thumbnail-container{height:100px;margin-bottom:1em;text-align:center}#aloha-cart-popover .aloha-price-container{text-align:center}#aloha-cart-popover .aloha-thumbnail-container img{height:inherit}#aloha-cart-popover .aloha-cart{border-top:1px solid #ddd;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd}#aloha-cart-popover #aloha-cart-info{margin-right:0}#alohaBuyBoxWidget .without-contract-subheading{margin-right:0}#aloha-bb-help-nodes .aloha-bb-contract-term-heading{color:gray;font-family:arial;margin-top:.5em;text-align:center;height:.7em;border-bottom:1px solid gray;margin-bottom:1.6em}#aloha-bb-help-nodes .aloha-bb-contract-term-heading span{background-color:#fff;padding:0 10px 0 10px}#alohaAvailabilityUS_feature_div .availability a{text-decoration:none}#alohaPricingWidget a{text-decoration:none}#alohaAvailabilityUS_feature_div .availability{margin-top:-4px;margin-bottom:0}#alohaBuyBoxWidget .select-transaction-alert .a-icon-alert{top:18px;left:3px}#alohaBuyBoxWidget .select-transaction-alert .a-alert-container{padding-left:39px;width:290px}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div #alohaBuyBoxWidget .contract-container .contract-term-heading a{text-decoration:none}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div #alohaBuyBoxWidget .annual-contract-box .a-icon-popover{display:none}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div #alohaBuyBoxWidget .contract-container .annual-contract-box{cursor:pointer;cursor:hand}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div #alohaBuyBoxWidget .aloha-buybox-price{font-size:15px}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div #alohaBuyBoxWidget #linkOffSection a{text-decoration:none}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div .lockedUsedBuyboxContainer{padding-left:3.5%}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div .alohaBuyboxUtilsNoWrap{white-space:nowrap}.hidden{display:none}.simo-no-padding{padding:0}.carrier-reviews-cell{padding-left:10px}.carrier-reviews-bordered-cell{border:1px dotted #ccc}.carrier-reviews-selected-cell{background-color:#ffd}#aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-description{margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:14px}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-sortable-header.carrier{min-width:97px}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-sortable-header.compatibility{min-width:156px}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-sortable-header div{float:left}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-sortable-header i.a-icon{margin-left:10px;margin-top:4px}#aloha-carrier-compatibility-overview-table.a-bordered.a-vertical-stripes td:nth-child(2n),#aloha-carrier-compatibility-overview-table.a-bordered.a-vertical-stripes th:nth-child(2n){background-color:initial}#aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table.a-bordered.a-vertical-stripes td:nth-child(2n),#aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table.a-bordered.a-vertical-stripes th:nth-child(2n){background-color:initial}#aloha-carrier-compatibility-table.a-bordered.a-vertical-stripes th:nth-child(2n),.aloha-carrier-compatibility-table.a-bordered.a-vertical-stripes td:nth-child(2n){background-color:transparent}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-column-gray{background-color:#f6f6f6}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .aloha-carrier-compatibility-tech-text,.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .carrier-name,.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .carrier-rating-summary{min-height:27px;display:inline-block;cursor:default}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .aloha-carrier-compatibility-tech-text:first-line,.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .carrier-name:first-line,.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .carrier-rating-summary:first-line{line-height:27px}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .aloha-carrier-compatibility-icon{margin-top:6px}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-check-icon{width:30px;height:27px;background-position:-318px -35px;background-image:url(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/AUIClients/AmazonUIBaseCSS-sprite_2x-8e7ef370dc28a214b3f490c9620f4ac501d5a864._V2_.png);background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:400px 650px;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-hidden{display:none}.aloha-buybox-spaced-link{margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:7px;text-align:center}.popover-tab",Software,B000BQM5OW

You can choose from four different vehicles including a dump truck, 4X4, racecar, and bulldozer. After you have chosen the perfect vehicle, get on one of the three tracks: ""Tropical Paradise,"" ""Scorching Desert,"" or the ""Winter Wonderland."" Your biggest challenge will be to try and stay off of the walls and in the lead. Once you cross the finish line, you receive points that you can use to upgrade your vehicle in four different areas: tires, shocks, turbo, and engine. Thanks to the built-in rumble capabilities, you will feel every bump and jolt in the game. Try to become a driving champion with TONKA RACEWAY.', ""Tonka Raceway is a fast, furious third-person racer from Hasbro Interactive. Let it be known: Comparisons to R/C Pro-Am are inevitable. What allows it to strike some kind of individual ground is the wacky, twisty design of its tracks, which will, quite literally, lead you in circles. Basically, you race around these mad tracks with three other vehicles. The tracks, for the most part, are rather cramped, as the computer-controlled racers will usually race close together in some tight cluster, and you can't go off-road. This leads to some crazy, bumper-car-style racing, replete with awful 360s, dead-wall stops, and all manner of frustration. Because the AI racers are a little on the dumb side, it's usually a cinch to finish each race first, granted you can maneuver through the tracks, which tend to get sort of wacky about three races into a circuit. After each race, you'll earn credits that you can use to upgrade your little machine. Factors such as tires, turbo, brakes, and your engine can be augmented, though, truth be told, the actual effects are a little on the abstract side; sure, you'll feel your car go faster, turn easier, and whatnot, but after the first few upgrades, you'll be so far ahead of the competition that any other enhancements just seem vainglorious. The truth is, it is quite possible to beat this game every time you play it, provided you have the time and desire to do so. All in all, Tonka Raceway is a fun, albeit light racer. Everything moves at decent tempo, and the rumble effects are solid. If R/C Pro-Am didn't exist, this game would probably be taken a bit more seriously. As is, Tonka Raceway is just a light rehash of a more solid title, perhaps aimed at a younger, less demanding audience.<i>--Miguel Lopez</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.
