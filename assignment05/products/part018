Supreme Commander Gold Edition,,"[""Supreme Commander: In the 33rd Century, the old Earth Empire finally collapsed. As chaos engulfed the interstellar empire, the military, under the aegis of the Earth Command, stepped forward to restore order. Acting in a severe and often draconian manner, Earth Command made the difficult decisions that politicians, mired in corruption and their own self-interest, could not. Entire worlds were abandoned, and much of the Quantum Gate network was intentionally destroyed in an effort to isolate the retreating Prime Worlds from the rest of the galaxy. Despite the best efforts of the military, civil war erupted. After a hundred years, Earth Command was finally able to restore order and establish a new government, which was christened the United Earth Federation. Risen, phoenix-like from the ashes of the old Earth Empire, the United Earth Federation vowed to purge itself of bureaucratic corruption and remain pure to a single task: the rescue of mankind's war-torn worlds and an end to the Infinite War. By any and all means necessary. It has worked toward that goal by maintaining an iron grip on the new empire, creating a totalitarian government out of what might be considered the most successful military coup in human history. Supreme Commander is the first ever RTS to deliver truly strategic as well as tactical gaming with an emphasis on scope as well as ease of use.

In <em>Mount &amp; Blade: Warband</em>, you lead your men into battle, expand your realm within the land of Calradia. Calradia is a land at war, a land offering great riches and even greater dangers to the adventurers and mercenaries that flock to shed their blood on its soil. With unerring courage and a strong sword, a warrior can make a name as for himself here and more. Raise a band of hardened soldiers, become the lord of several towns and castles, and perhaps one day you may wield the power to depose kings and perhaps take their thrones for yourself.', ""<strong>Gameplay</strong><br /> <em>Mount &amp; Blade: Warband</em> is an action RPG that utilizes medieval weapons, units, combat techniques&mdash;especially cavalry&mdash;and strategy exclusively. It does not feature magic. It is a standalone expansion of the original game's universe and play mechanics, meaning that the original <em>Mount &amp; Blade</em> game is not necessary for play. In single player mode players create a character, align themselves with one of the five fictional, yet historically realistic, factions existing in the gameworld and set off to carve out a realm for themselves is the kingdom of Calradia. Along the way they will meet units of other factions on the field of battle and with continued success against them gain experience and level up their character, and units. Along with being able to control their character, players are able to command and control their units in a real-time strategy (RTS) like capacity. Unlike the original game, in <em>Warband</em> players are afforded more diplomatic tools and strategies&mdash;such as political marriages&mdash;which can ultimately allow them to move beyond simply overthrowing a monarch, instead allowing them to take the throne themselves and even install vassals."", ""<strong>Multiplayer Options</strong><br /> Again, setting itself apart from the original single player game, <em>Mount &amp; Blade: Warband</em> allows for a wide variety of online multiplayer scenarios. These range from near massive multiplayer online conflicts that support up to 64 players, to more organized smaller skirmishes. Modes available online include: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Conquest, Battle, and Siege. Within select online multiplayer modes units can be commanded in the RTS fashion available in single player. In this players take control of a set number of bot units in all out competition against all other players, or gather their controlled units together within a single faction splitting battlefield responsibilities in their fight against others. In this, <em>Mount &amp; Blade: Warband</em> allows players to unleash both their individual character's skill at arms, as well as their overall ability to strategize on the battlefield in live play."", '<strong>Key Game Features</strong>']","by

Fisher is now a renegade operative digging into the events of the past and he doesn\'t like what he has found. His personal investigation into his daughter\'s death reveals that he\'s been betrayed by his former agency, the Third Echelon. The agency responds by pursuing him, but as he works to elude them he becomes aware of a deadly terrorist plot that threatens millions. He is uniquely positioned and prepared to act against this, but success is doubtful without the help of former friends from the Third Echelon team, resulting in a series of life and death situations for himself and the country where trust can by no means be assumed.', ""<strong>Gameplay</strong><br /> <em>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction</em>, as with all games in the <em>Splinter Cell</em> series, is a tactical stealth-action game. In single player modes players take on the role of Sam Fisher and engage in a series of missions utilizing high-tech weaponry, gadgets, lethal hand-to-hand combat and interrogation skills. Overall objectives and the necessary steps to achieve them are challenging, yet always clear via dual verbal and visual expression that seamlessly alerts players as they progress through missions. In addition, <em>Conviction</em> enhances the world of stealth combat that has made the <em>Splinter Cell</em> franchise a runaway hit for years through a series of revolutionary new gameplay features.

In <i>Mount & Blade: Warband</i>, you lead your men into battle, expand your realm within the land of Calradia. Calradia is a land at war, a land offering great riches and even greater dangers to the adventurers and mercenaries that flock to shed their blood on its soil. With unerring courage and a strong sword, a warrior can make a name as for himself here and more. Raise a band of hardened soldiers, become the lord of several towns and castles, and perhaps one day you may wield the power to depose kings and perhaps take their thrones for yourself. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br /> <i>Mount & Blade: Warband</i> is an action RPG that utilizes medieval weapons, units, combat techniques&#x97;especially cavalry&#x97;and strategy exclusively. It does not feature magic. It is a standalone expansion of the original game\'s universe and play mechanics, meaning that the original <i>Mount & Blade</i> game is not necessary for play. In single player mode players create a character, align themselves with one of the five fictional, yet historically realistic, factions existing in the gameworld and set off to carve out a realm for themselves is the kingdom of Calradia. Along the way they will meet units of other factions on the field of battle and with continued success against them gain experience and level up their character, and units. Along with being able to control their character, players are able to command and control their units in a real-time strategy (RTS) like capacity. Unlike the original game, in <i>Warband</i> players are afforded more diplomatic tools and strategies&#x97;such as political marriages&#x97;which can ultimately allow them to move beyond simply overthrowing a monarch, instead allowing them to take the throne themselves and even install vassals. <p/> <b>Multiplayer Options</b><br /> Again, setting itself apart from the original single player game, <i>Mount & Blade: Warband</i> allows for a wide variety of online multiplayer scenarios. These range from near massive multiplayer online conflicts that support up to 64 players, to more organized smaller skirmishes. Modes available online include: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Conquest, Battle, and Siege. Within select online multiplayer modes units can be commanded in the RTS fashion available in single player. In this players take control of a set number of bot units in all out competition against all other players, or gather their controlled units together within a single faction splitting battlefield responsibilities in their fight against others.

A puck-smashing, opponent-pummeling, ice-dominating prodigy, you are fast on your way to hockey greatness, and the success of just one match lies between you and your NHL dream. You glide to the center red line and look into your opponent's shielded face as you crouch down in preparation. The puck falls, as if in slow motion, as you both spring forward, sticks thrashing, ice flying and limbs thrusting. Just as you start to break away, you take a bone-crushing hit and hear the splintering of wood as your stick snaps apart. If you can't use your sharp reflexes and agile intuition to wrest away the puck, your dream could slip away forever. Are you a true NHL champion?"", ""Skate into realistic hockey action, the likes of which you've only seen at the rink itself, as you take on the future of hockey gaming in NHL 11. This time, as you take it to the ice, every deke, hip check and scramble is in revolutionary, real-time, physics-triggered realism. With a pioneering physics engine, NHL 11 reacts to your every move with precision for the most authentic hockey experience available. Use all-new and enhanced skills as you strive for the Canadian Hockey League's Memorial Cup for the first time in a thrilling new career mode and celebrate your glories in banner-raising ceremonies. With NHL 11, the ice action has never been so real, and if you're lucky, neither has your puck prowess."", '&nbsp;']","by

As the name of the game might imply, action plays out in sections or records, referred to as generations. The possibilities within each of these is formed in cause and effect scenarios determined by the actions of your character in the previous generation. These actions are tied to locations visited on the map, where battles, interactions, quests and the blossoming of relationships with female characters take place. Turn-based battles are fought as a group by the player and her/his party of AI companions where each acts in turn, before enemy units take their turn. Each of the possible characters in your party has her/his own strengths and weaknesses, which can be maximized or minimized in each combat situation by adopting particular strategies. These can be as simple as placing stronger characters in front where they can do the heavy fighting and weaker characters in the rear where they can provide healing, or more advanced tactics like precise spacing of characters which will allow for joint attacks, or choice of specific battle areas to magnify character abilities. Regardless, victory in battle earns the party points which can be used to level up all members of the party, purchase weapons and items, etc. <p/> As events unfold players will also develop potential relations with female members of their party via the ""Soul Breed"" system. Like real relationships these are filled with ups and downs and unfold entirely dependent on your actions. All sorts of decisions affect the way possible mates will feel about you. This can be tracked, and thus possibly influenced, via the Link/Affection Gauge tool which is a graphical representation of decisions and how the female characters in the game feel about you in relation to them. In the end, if you are not rejected, you build a serious relationship with one of these characters and eventually have a child. That child will serve as the protagonist in the next generation of action, possess abilities which the union of the two character\'s skills and abilities equates to and proceeds with new adventures and relationships. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Epic Strategic RPG with Ginormous Game Time</b> - <i>Record of Agarest War</i> spans over 100 hours of gameplay, not including side/bonus missions.</li> <li><b>Soul Breed System</b> - Tired of just living through one lifetime in typical RPG titles?

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin\'s hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin\'s final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation\'s shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can\'t afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America\'s answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now. <p/> <b>Gameplay and Weapons</b><br/> Action in <i>Singularity</i> is a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are: <ol> <u>Reversion</u> - The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.<br/> <u>Aging</u> - The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.<br/> <u>Stasis</u> - The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.<br/> <u>Impulse</u> - The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.<br/> <u>Chronolite</u> - Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.<br/> </ol> Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD\'s combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12. <p/> <b>Multiplayer</b><br/> <i>Singularity</i> contains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li>An engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.</li> <li>An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.</li> <li>Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.</li> <li>Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.</li> <li>Multiplayer gameplay options.</li> <li>PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin\'s hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin\'s final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation\'s shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can\'t afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America\'s answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now. <p/> <b>Gameplay and Weapons</b><br/> Action in <i>Singularity</i> is a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are: <ol> <u>Reversion</u> - The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.<br/> <u>Aging</u> - The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.<br/> <u>Stasis</u> - The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.<br/> <u>Impulse</u> - The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.<br/> <u>Chronolite</u> - Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.<br/> </ol> Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD\'s combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12. <p/> <b>Multiplayer</b><br/> <i>Singularity</i> contains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li>An engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.</li> <li>An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.</li> <li>Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.</li> <li>Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.</li> <li>Multiplayer gameplay options.</li> <li>PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances.

His quests take him to the far-off reaches of the continent. Constantly on the alert for a clue as to her whereabouts, he keeps his eyes and ears open during his travels. The mercenary jobs he gets are not just for collecting information; he also receives gold for these tasks and he must have gold to continue his search. However, it's not always easy to find tasks that pay - he even has to gain a reputation with certain groups before they'll even think of entrusting a tricky task to him. After many weary months of searching, he finally gets his first clue - a mysterious letter that tells him to make for the mountainous region of the far north. As luck would have it, he has also heard of a possible job in the village of Komorin in Thalmont and that's on his route - so it's the open road for him again. The villagers in Komorin can also count themselves lucky that they've actually found a mercenary to help them with their problem - most of the young and capable men have gone to help fight the Orcs in the south. The Thalmont government hasn't helped much either - officialdom says it can't spare the time for other problems when they have rebels to deal with... Thus begins the story of Two Worlds - one mercenary arrives alone in Thalmont, a wild mountainous region totally unfamiliar to him. Will he succeed in finding his sister?""]","by

Chuck\'s motivation for taking part and risking life and limb is his daughter Katey, who since being bitten by a zombie requires a daily dose of Zombrex to prevent her from turning into one of the living dead. There\'s no denying that Zombrex works, but since it\'s the only drug on the market, its price is high. <p/> During his time in Fortune City a zombie outbreak occurs and Chuck must survive the onslaught of the undead for 72 hours. Pitted against two fearsome threats - tens of thousands of zombies and the constant countdown of the clock - while potentially rescuing other survivors of the zombie apocalypse, players must also unravel the greater conspiracy behind the outbreak and as importantly find the Zombrex necessary to stop Katey from joining the ever growing zombie horde. Players will shoot, stab, carve and drive their way through enemies in order to beat the clock and survive 72-hours in the darkly comedic, no holds-barred confines of Fortune City. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Dead Rising 2</i> delivers more of the signature gameplay that the series is known for plus a number of new features. Players who might need some help or simply want to share the zombie bashing fun with a friend will now be able to play in online 2-player co-op. Simply use the in-game transceiver to call for assistance at any time and once your partner has accepted, they will arrive by your side for double the action. <p/> With hundreds of zombies on screen at any one time, the original <i>Dead Rising</i> forced gamers to take everyday objects they found in the mall and use them as weapons. But now, in <i>Dead Rising 2</i> with thousands of zombies filling every square inch of Fortune City, Chuck is going to need to be even more resourceful and inventive by creating combination weapons to save the day. Players will be able to take two objects, a roll of tape and with a little inventiveness create an advanced zombie-killing combo weapon - a piece of wood and a lawnmower become Portamower, the handheld mower that cuts zombies down to size in an instant; while a garden rake and car battery combine to create an electrified zombie prod. The more combo weapons a player uses, the more Prestige Points (PPS) they will gain along the way in order to level up Chuck. <p/> <b>Development Team</b><br/> <i>Dead Rising 2</i> is developed by Canadian developer Blue Castle Games in close collaboration with Capcom. A number of members from the original <i>Dead Rising</i> team have added their talents and experience to the Blue Castle Games team throughout the development process, including Capcom\'s global head of research and development, Keiji Inafune, who as the game\'s producer, and played an active role in the project. <p/> <b><i>Dead Rising 2</i> Collector\'s Edition for PlayStation 3 Includes</b><p/> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0""> <tr> <td valign=""top"" height=""135"" width=""200""> <div align=""center""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B003UZ49TU.01.lg.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Contents of the Dead Rising 2 Collector\'s Edition for PlayStation 3"" title=""Contents of the Dead Rising 2 Collector\'s Edition for PlayStation 3"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B003UZ49TU.01.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""200"" height=""132""></a><br> <div class=""imageCaption""> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B003UZ49TU.01.lg.jpg"" target=""_blank"">View larger</a>.</div></div> </td> <td valign=""top"" height=""135"" width=""817""> <ul> <li><i>Dead Rising 2</i> game disc for PlayStation 3</li> <li>Exclusive two-disc steelbook case</li> <li>Blu-ray disc containing the 24-minute ""Making of"" featurette</li> <li>Zombrex ""Syringe"" pen</li> <li>Zombrex ""Prescription"" notepad (25 pages)</li> <li>Zombrex ""Safety"" card</li> <li>Zombrex ""Prospectus"" sales brochure (16 pages)</li> <li><i>Dead Rising 2</i> hardback artbook (48 pages)</li> <li>Voucher for XMB dynamic theme</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <br/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Thousands of Zombies On Screen</b> - The undead are everywhere creating a dynamic and challenging zombie-killing experience for the player as weapons will be created to kill massive amounts of zombies at one time</li> <li><b>New Storyline and Characters</b> - A new protagonist, Chuck Greene, is just the beginning in a long list of new characters, new survivors and new more vicious psychos that will be introduced to fans in the new world of <i>Dead Rising</i></li> <li><b>2-Player Co-Op</b> - Co-op play is introduced to the <i>Dead Rising</i> universe for the first time as players can invite their friends to partner up with them at any time to take on the zombie massacre- tag-team style.
