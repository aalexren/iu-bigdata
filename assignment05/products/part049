Action in both these areas draws inspiration from modern musical genres and their production techniques, the most obvious of which being the various sampling techniques found in hip-hop and electronica. The difference here is that the tracks created are all about what you want. Play DJ with the huge amount of pre-produced content, or put on your producer\'s hat and create your own loops and samples. The choice is yours. The game contains many sub modes, but the two main ones are: Live Play and Studio. <p/> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""2""> <tr> <td valign=""top"" width=""91"">&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Live Play</u></td> <td width=""841"">An easy to use visual song tool for beginners, Live Play Mode is designed to have users producing professional sounding music right out of the box. Within it players choose a genre of music, and using up to eight pre-produced tracks associated with that style, they set to building a song. This is done by assigning each of the track to specific buttons and graphically representing them in the four corners of the available screens. In the event that players wish to streamline this even further, the mode also contains three exclusive Timbaland instrumental songs, that can be used as a musical backdrop and can be remixed adding samples from the tracks mentioned.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign=""top"" width=""91"">&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Studio</u></td> <td width=""841"">Studio Mode is similar to Live Play in that you are blending individual loops to create a new song, but in a deeper more advanced way. Instead of a tactile visual representation of the tracks in front of a DJ, players work on tracks arranged on a professional looking 8-track sound board, complete with a wide variety of control knobs, time coding of the song and more. Players can also import new samples and loops--including voice recordings and .wav files--from the PSP\'s mic and/or memory stick and can even add individual notes within a set scale, so you are always in tune. Using sub-modes, like Sound Editor, Melody Crafter, Drum Crafter, Synth Loop and others, they can then create their own loops, which can in turn make up a single track, blended into a yet greater whole if they so chose. In this players can add virtually as many layers as they want to the music they create, which can then be saved and uploaded to Rockstar Games Social Club for the world to enjoy.</td> </tr> </table> <p/> <b>What\'s Rockstar Games Social Club?</b><br/> The Social Club is a member&rsquo;s only website destination for leaderboards, stats, tournaments, ongoing special competitions, virtual events, soundtrack mp3 shopping and more for Rockstar titles &ndash; launched with the console releases of <i>Grand Theft Auto IV</i> and carrying on to support virtually all Rockstar releases to come.

Smart Games 3 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""The newest addition to the award-winning Smart Games series is here. <i>Challenge 3</i> is an all-new collection of 20 original, addictive games with hundreds of game levels. There's something for everyone--action puzzles, music puzzles, word puzzles, and visual puzzles. With great graphics, sound, and 3-D animation, it takes the already popular series to a new level."", 'Smart Games are for smart people. There\'s no way around it. Whether playing these games will actually make you smarter overall or just smarter at playing these games is up for debate. Now, I really like packages of desktop puzzles because I can take a quick break from my adventure-game-like job and sharpen my brain from the well-chewed stub it is. While Smart Games 3 offers a wide assortment of puzzles, many of them are Mensa-only mind benders. <P> Like many other desktop puzzle collections, you\'re presented with a menu of different games, 20 in this case. These games range from seemingly simple pattern-recognition games to math games to word games and even a trivia game. In one game, you try to seat passengers on an airplane by applying different rules to different groups of people. For example, Masons must sit in the same row as Lions, and Shriners must sit in even-numbered rows. The trick is getting all the passengers seated without violating any rules. Another game uses the familiar rock-paper-scissors theme. You eliminate items until every item is gone except one. Extra points are awarded if you can place a specific item in a specific square as your last move. Yet another game has you match up groups of butterflies based on wing pattern and shape, eliminated three, four, and five at a time. In this game, you get points for clearing the board as well as matching up patterns and wing shape. <P> You can probably tell that the games I liked the best had to do with recognizing and memorizing patterns. Some of my other colleagues preferred the math-oriented games (which I cannot do at all, much to my chagrin) and the word-oriented games (which I liked, but not as well as the pattern-recognition games). The only game that seems out of place in this collection is the trivia game (Who, What, Where, When), which rewards knowledge, not intelligence. <P> The first level of every puzzle is ridiculously simple. This makes for a nice, confidence-boosting start. Even I could get through the first level of Tumblin\' Dice (a tricky math puzzle). However, the puzzles quickly increase in difficulty. It\'s rather like wading into the ocean up to your knees and having the sand suddenly drop away, leaving only the trackless depths below and the raging waters in front of you. I would have been more willing to play more games if the learning curve hadn\'t been quite so unforgiving. <P> While many of the 20 games had simple instructions, making play relatively intuitive, many had such complex instructions and counterintuitive keyboard commands, I simply gave up trying to make that stupid Lego-like brick snap into place and went back to seating the Shriners next to the Masons. No doubt these more-complicated games are a good brain tease, I just feel that desktop puzzles should be easy to learn and difficult to master. I don\'t want to spend half an hour just figuring out how to play. If I want that kind of torture, I\'ll fire up the Starcraft tutorial again. <P> One thing Smart Games 3 gives you is lots and lots of puzzles. Each of the 20 puzzles has at least 30 levels (one has 100), giving you more than 600 levels to play (yes, I used my calculator to figure that one out). In addition, if you get bored, you can download puzzle packs from the [<a href=""http://www.smartgames.com"">]Smart Games web site[</a>] that contain new levels for the Smart Games 3 games. In addition, you can join Smart Games leagues and compete in online contests. <P> So, on the one hand, I curse Smart Games 3 for telling me that my 33-year-old brain isn\'t as sharp as it was in its Stanford days. On the other hand, I just spent two hours getting rid of all the butterflies. If mind-bending addictive puzzles are your thing, you\'ll love Smart Games 3. <i>--Nicole Freeman</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The Dracons are a fierce race that dominated Magol until the corporations moved in. These aggressive creatures are natural fighters, and even a Dracon's trainer knows better than to upset one. While Dracons don't have a culture, they do seem to have more intelligence than one would expect. They are crafty hunters who use their brains as well as their brawn to back own prey.""]",Wea Corp,[],,Software,B001L4CACK

Dark Reign Mission Pack: Rise of the Shadowhand - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""When a stray Freedom Guard transport stumbles upon a secret Imperium research base in a remote system at the edge of the galaxy, crew members find a possible genetic cure for the mark that controls their lives. But the Freedom Guard must master a new species of semi-intelligent animals and battle a force of the Imperium's secret intelligence organization to succeed. <P> Enter a warring galaxy as either the Freedom Guard commander or the Imperium Shadowhand admiral. Engage in the epic battle for control of a newly discovered technology that could forever change the course of the war."", 'The latest trend with real-time strategy games is to develop a successful product, and then turn it into a money-printing franchise by churning out unimpressive expansion discs. Fortunately, Activision has done just the opposite by making Dark Reign: Rise of the Shadowhand almost as good as an entirely new sequel. <P> So what makes this expansion disc so special? Well, for starters, it raises the amount of playable sides in the game from two to four, effectively doubling the depth of the game with that feature alone. While these new sides (Xenites and Shadowhand) aren\'t as diverse as the three found in Starcraft, they are different enough to encourage Dark Reign veterans to learn numerous new techniques. The Xenites, for example, are derived from the original game\'s Freedom Guard while the Shadowhand are similar to the Imperium. Each side has just enough units handed down from its predecessors to make experienced Dark Reign players feel comfortable, but there are plenty of new units that make it fell like an entirely new game. The Shadowhand are a slightly more powerful, less versatile version of the Imperium. They come equipped with the EMP device, a new superweapon that scrambles communications between the opposing player and his units, in addition to scrambling his radar and communications . The new, ""conventional"" units include a transformable Gemini Tank, a fire-spewing Hades Bomber, the powerful Fury robot, and giant infantry called Reapers. The Xenites are a stronger, but less stealthy Freedom Guard. They have enlisted the help of large, alien mutants that include energy-emitting Grendels and Gants that must be micromanaged by keepers. The Xenites also have a devious new superweapon called the Power Striker that can knock out the power of an entire base by simply sabotaging a single energy plant. Both sides are equipped with terrain-sculpting devices called Terraformers. Suffice to say, Rise of the Shadowhand provides a diverse and interesting set of new units to play with. And better yet, after many hours of rigorous multiplayer testing, it seems that all four sides are well balanced. <P> Aside from the new combatants, Rise of the Shadowhand provides 14 new single-player missions, numerous new multiplayer maps, and an entirely new soundtrack to set the mood. Activision even included the best fan-made Dark Reign game ""conversions"" and multiplayer maps. In addition, there are now multiplayer missions where you must achieve certain goals. Technically, the multiplayer engine has been improved by fine-tuning the network code, expanding ActiveLink (Activision\'s Internet server) multiplayer support to eight players, and adding a new automatic map-transferal system. There is also a rather thoughtful patch that allows non-owners of the expansion disc to play against the new sides in multiplayer games (but not as them). <P> Clearly, Dark Reign: Rise of the Shadowhand accomplishes the challenging feat of significantly improving one of last year\'s best and most complex real-time strategy games. It\'s just unfortunate that Activision\'s commendable effort may be obscured by the large and ominous shadow cast by Starcraft.<i>--Kraig Kujawa</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

League of Pain,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Professional Underground League of Pain by Psygnosis represents video gaming's latest trend: beautifully shaded graphics and lush stereo sound contrasted with poor game play. It's a sad trend in video games today; the output improves at an incredible rate while the input stagnates. In other words, you can see millions of colors and hear incredible music, but the gameplay is limited to pressing a couple of buttons."", 'The story goes like this: It\'s late in the 21st century and the sporting industries of basketball, hockey, and boxing have collapsed (I don\'t care what happens, hockey will only disappear over my dead, national- sport-playing, Canadian body!). The athletes now compete in the ""Professional Underground League of Pain,"" or PULP, where the games consist of two teams competing to throw a plasma ball into a hoop above the court\'s center. Before scoring, however, players must charge the plasma ball. This wouldn\'t be so difficult, except that each team\'s charger is centrally located deep in the opponent\'s territory. Think basketball meets Blast Chamber on steroids! There\'s little doubt that this game could have been fun....', ""League of Pain boasts myriad camera angles; unfortunately, most of them are ineffective. In fact, I found the game very difficult to play until I started using one of the (significantly less attractive) overhead views. If you stick with the default camera setting you'll get the snot kicked out of you while you're figuring out what's going on (as I did the first few times through). Adding to that confusion, it's very hard to tell your teammates from your opponents - each player is silver, and only team color accents differentiate them."", 'PULP\'s main problem, however, lies in the translation of its premise into play mechanics. A no-holds-barred futuristic sports game with lots of punching and kicking sounds inviting - only that\'s not really what League of Pain is. In reality the game is reminiscent of Activision\'s Blast Chamber with the addition of teammates. But where Blast Chamber\'s simplicity made it amusing (you essentially blew up your opponents), it never claimed to be more than it was. League of Pain erroneously boasts that you can punch, kick, and claw the ball away from an opponent - had they been honest and just said ""shove"" , then the game probably wouldn\'t be as disappointing as it is. And regarding the ""no rules"" futuristic sports category - when did having rules make a game bad? Would baseball be any fun if there were no outs? Would hockey be worth watching if the players were allowed to fight? (OK, bad example).', ""League of Pain falls short of Psygnosis' track record. Although the game offers several modes of play (League, Tournament, and Exhibition) and management features (player trading, etc.) you're hard pressed to play it for any length of time. If the future of sporting events lies with the Professional Underground League of Pain, I think I'll stick to more traditional pastimes. --Ed Robertson <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Fortunately, it\'s a cocktail not without reward. Grounded on what is effectively a simple mixture of pass, tackle, and shoot--all moves which are suitably intuitive and easy to get to grips with--the basic game in itself is a quite enjoyable kickaround. The differential though comes with the ""boost"" button. By holding this as you tackle, you can quite literally fly-kick your opponents off the ball. While shooting? Get ready for a <I>Matrix</I>-style slow-motion buildup before launching an explosive effort towards goal. Suffice to say, there are plenty of little moves to master, and you\'re going to have a lot of fun learning them.', 'Yet while this could easily turn out to be short-lived fun, Midway has injected <I>Red Card</I> with a few extra goodies to ensure a longer play life. The World Conquest mode, for instance, allows you to take control of a national side and quite literally beat the best of the world, while cup tournaments and the simply essential multiplayer mode further enhanced the entertainment. Throw in extra teams and such like to unlock and there\'s a fair challenge packed onto the disc. So don\'t be fooled by the seemingly over-the-top approach of the game.

Epidemic - PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Remember Kileak: The DNA Imperative? One of the first games available for the Playstation when the machine launched in late 1995, Kileak was a rather unimpressive conversion of a Japanese first-person shooter (complete with a storyline that made about as much sense as the Mission: Impossible movie). But it must have sold pretty well - either that or someone at Sony has a soft spot for imported cheese - because US gamers have now been graced with Epidemic, the unofficial sequel to Kileak.', 'As with its prequel, Epidemic is a first-person shooter that buckles players inside a giant robot and forces them to wander through miles of generic underground corridors, shooting enemy mechanoids, picking up items, and solving mini-puzzles of the ""find an object here and use it there"" variety. There are a lot of these so-called puzzles - more than in any other first-person shooter, as far as I can tell - and solving them usually requires exploring every inch of every level to find the needed clues or items. (Fortunately, the player\'s \'bot is equipped with a well-executed automapping system to keep track of its travels.)', 'However, Epidemic does significantly improve upon Kileak in the audiovisual categories: The graphics are fine, and some of the music tracks even have a toe-tappin\' groove to them. But the graphics still rank far below the splendor of Alien Trilogy, Disruptor, or even Final Doom (which is a port of a three-year-old computer game, for cryin\' out loud). The end result: a game whose ""new and improved"" look is only average.', ""Gameplay is tragically flawed, as you can only save after completing a level. With levels that can take upwards of an hour to complete, Epidemic turns into tedium and torture if the end-of-level boss repeatedly waxes you - yes, you have to do it all over again. Granted this makes the game harder to complete, but after a few frustrating hours of near victories, it's doubtful that you'll care care enough to finish the game."", ""Epidemic's real hook is that its lengthy story runs throughout the game; you're always stumbling into new plot developments or full motion video clips as you play through each level. Perhaps this feature will provide some gamers with incentive enough to keep playing an otherwise dull game. But even to those players it will be clear that the Sony team forgot to make the story as interesting as the game is long.Maybe a brilliant tale was lost in the translation from Japanese to English. Maybe the story was weak to begin with. Maybe the often over-the-top voice acting ruined it for me. Whatever the reason, I never found myself caring about the game's characters, which snuffed some of the replay value."", ""I've always given Sony two snaps up for importing their Japanese Playstation titles (particularly games like Aquanaut's Holiday and Jumping Flash!), but Epidemic needs a more engrossing storyline to make up for the painfully average gameplay. And because the story is so thin, the game ranks near the bottom of the crowded first-person shooter genre. --Zach Meston <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Destruction Derby Raw,,['Disc plus hard plastic protective replacement case only. Disc condition ranges from flawless to scratched but is guaranteed to work.'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""As crazy as it may sound, Destruction Derby stands alone as the premier demolition racing series on the PlayStation. Twisted Metal has its warfare motif, and Infogrames' Demolition Racer made a good attempt, but no company has been able to achieve the same level of quality that Psygnosis has with Destruction Derby. When Psygnosis disappeared from the US gaming scene this past year, fans feared they would be taking the next installment in the series, Destruction Derby 3, with them.  Thankfully, these fears turned out to be unfounded, as thanks to Midway's recent publishing deal with Psygnosis, Destruction Derby Raw, the third installment in the Destruction Derby series, is finally here."", 'The first improvement you\'ll notice with Destruction Derby Raw appears on the title screen: There are many more gameplay options. There\'s a season-style wreckin\' racing mode, where you earn points for completing tracks and thrashing your opponents.  You can\'t upgrade your car in this mode, but you do get to choose the order in which you complete the 25 courses. The next menu option, smash4$ (that\'s ""smash for cash,"" in case you aren\'t into reading license plates), takes the wreckin\' racing formula and twists it, in that you lose the choice of which course to race, but you earn money with which to upgrade your vehicle. These single-player modes also give you the ability to unlock eight bonus cars, such as a delivery truck or a police car. As for initial vehicles, the game gives you access to eight, but this stock set climbs to 17 once you complete a few tracks or purchase them. Should you tire of the single-player experience, Destruction Derby Raw also contains four multiplayer battle games, all of which support up to four human players and 16 CPU onscreen opponents. There\'s the stadium-based destruction derby, the team-based capture the flag game called assault, the skyscraper battle mode, and the remake of schoolyard tag titled pass da bomb. Adding to the Destruction Derby Raw\'s overwhelming variety, each of these multiplayer modes has a number of additional gameplay settings, such as vampire and suicide options, that further increase the game\'s replay value.', ""Once you actually take these features out for a test drive, you'll notice that Destruction Derby Raw isn't fundamentally different from its predecessors. You still need to attempt to disrupt opponent vehicles while trying to finish a race, and you still must do so while keeping track of your own damage meter. Although you don't have to finish first to proceed to the next race, doing so won't hurt your point totals. To aid this effort, the turbo meter makes its triumphant return, giving you a much needed boost of speed with a tap of the L2 button."", ""Just because the game includes features from past releases, don't get the impression that Destruction Derby Raw is a total rehash. It's not. The game actually has a number of excellent new gameplay features. Developer Studio 33 has tweaked the collision system to better allow for side-impact collisions and chain reactions, and while the game still doesn't account for rooftop landings or driver's-side impacts, the amount of damage your car incurs from head-on crashes has at least been diminished. As such, you still need to work hard to earn those collision points, but now you at least have the time to do so. The new collision system, coupled with a plethora of new crashes and flips, makes the task of destroying opponents both enjoyable and exciting, as you're no longer plowing through groups of cars without reward. In Destruction Derby Raw, you'll get enough chain-reaction points to make your head spin. Rounding out the new additions, a much needed hand brake makes its debut, giving the game the precise control it has been lacking for so many years. Now, when that pesky Colorado is on your tail, you can just do a doughnut and take him out."", ""While Destruction Derby Raw's gameplay is a clear-cut mixture of old and new, its visual prowess manifests itself as a subtle set of improvements. Tracks are a pleasant combination of wide and narrow twists and turns, with plenty of optional shortcuts, jumps, and pitfalls. Background detail is the highest it has ever been in a Destruction Derby game, with the number of skyscrapers, pipes, and roadside foliage providing an added degree of realism and tension. As far as frame rate goes, the game seems to move faster than Destruction Derby 2, although at a cost of increased texture graininess. There's hardly any texture warping or slowdown, though, which makes the game much easier to see than its predecessors. While the game places the majority of its visual emphasis on environmental detail and frame rate, an adequate array of simple particle effects, explosions, and car decals also contribute to Destruction Derby Raw's visual experience."", ""Even more subtly than its graphical enhancements, Destruction Derby Raw's audio isn't much different from or better than that of Destruction Derby 2. The music, a decent blend of techno, house, and rock, puts most other racing games to shame. The game's effects, on the other hand, run the gamut from the pleasing sound of bent metal to the laughable rendition of a dangling muffler on pavement. At times, the game sounds like aluminum cans placed under a microphone, but the strong array of explosion effects and bass thumping beats lessens the silliness somewhat. Destruction Derby Raw's audio offerings pretty much sum up the game itself: a subtle series of fixes and adjustments to an already solid game.  Better control over collisions would have been nice, but the greater track selection and sheer number of additional multiplayer options more than makes up for such an omission.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc.

Get ready to use world class technology with flight modeling that's so realistic secret military-only features had to be removed."", 'Sometimes when I\'m cleaning my ears I push the Q-tip just a little too far in, and it hits something that hurts like hell. It kind of hums for a while and then settles into a dull ache. The thing is, I can experience this sensation all I want for about a quarter cent per tip, whereas Bethesda would have me pay upwards of $40 for relatively the same sensation. That throbbing in the brain, that jabbing pain in the head: That\'s about what I took away from Bethesda\'s first attempt at a flight simulation, F-16 Aggressor. <P>British flight sims are like the British: They may have one or two good bits, but it always goes to hell when you get to the teeth. In the case of British sims, things always go to hell when you get to the controls. They wind up assigning simple commands like ""fire guns"" to Alt + Ctrl + ~ and so forth. Let\'s face it: There has never been a British sim that was worth a damn out of the box. DID took two years to get EF2000 up to par, and Total Air War still isn\'t exactly burnin\' \'em up. Rowan seems to assign controls by having a chicken pick at three successive keys and binding all three to a common command like ""raise flaps."" And now we have GSI, composed of former employees of DID, and their brainchild F-16 Aggressor. Their key assignments aren\'t as baroque as in other games, but they\'ve managed to commit the Unholy Trinity of sim no-nos: no key mapping, no joystick configuration, and, stunningly, no keycard included in the packaging. It\'s almost like they want to make your brain hurt. <P>F-16 Aggressor has puzzling aspirations. The designers actually set out to re-create Strike Commander. Remember Strike Commander? It was going to be Origin\'s flight sim version of the Wing Commander format, a narrative-driven mercenary flight simulation. Unfortunately, it didn\'t turn out quite right. It was incredibly late, pretty buggy, and just not all that impressive. So of course it makes perfect sense to emulate it. And then, to really nail the lid down, GSI emulates it badly. <P>The real shame of it is there is a fine, fine flight simulator at the core of Aggressor. GSI has modeled the F-16\'s flight properties with commendable detail. The funky handling of the rudders at certain speeds, tough landings, speed bleeding, and other things related to flight are all smack on. It\'s a flight model worthy of the best F-16 sims, poised to offer the hard-core crowd everything it could demand... until you get to the systems modeling. These are more on par with a Novalogic game. The complex instrument modeling of Falcon 4.0 and other true hard-core sims is only hinted at in Aggressor. <P>This is not a problem for a midlevel sim, but Aggressor has pretensions of hard-core greatness - pretensions that crash to the ground due to grossly simplified radar controls. A sim has two prime components: the modeling of the flight of the plane and the modeling of the systems. On one count, the developers succeed at realism, and on the other, they fail. In the end, they scuttle all their good programming by failing to offer any realism or difficulty switches whatsoever. The flight model is set to its full realism level at all times. When you have a very realistic flight model, an unrealistic set of sensors, and no ability to change the complexity of anything, you have some truly schizoid problems. <P>Graphically, while F-16 is quite good, if at times mind-blowing, it\'s true that there are better-looking, better-performing sims out there. The terrain is a bit patchy, but object modeling is good. Cockpits look very good and have effective dynamic animations for throttle and stick. HUD overlays and quick-view keys provide excellent perspectives on the instruments. In another stunning lapse, however, GSI has failed to include a padlock view. This makes situational awareness well nigh impossible and deals another serious blow to the sim. <P>Possibly the most baffling aspect of F-16 is its alleged ""mercenary flight sim"" nature. You would expect to have to fly missions to earn money to pay for weapons and upkeep on your planes. That was the plan in early specs for this game, and there are traces of it left. You still fly for money, but the money is merely used to rate your performance. It has no other function. As for the ""mercenary"" element, it\'s mainly limited to mission structure and some cursory background info. Missions range across Africa and include a fair selection of strike and dogfighting action. Without any in-game mission statements or target priorities, it\'s often hard to remember just what you\'re supposed to be doing. The quick-start missions allow for some custom dogfighting configurations, but there\'s no mission editor. As for the AI, it\'s OK, but nothing special. Wingmen (when you have them, which is rarely) aren\'t much help, and enemy pilots aren\'t all that aggressive. At least Aggressor has multiplayer, which compensates for these failings only slightly. <P>Aside from a very good flight model, there really isn\'t a lot for which to recommend F-16 Aggressor. For a company to create a sim with not only no key mapping, but also no key assignment card, is just mind-blowing. (You can find the key assignments buried in a 200-page manual.) This feels like a game that started out really good, with some strong elements and good design intentions. But then it got delayed over and over, features were dropped, sections removed, and finally it just shipped.

Although many of its elements tie into the greater Final Fantasy universe, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.\n\nWhile it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best from Final Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered. Crystal Chronicles may break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren. \n\nAs stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. The Final Fantasy games are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought in Crystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably absent.\n\nThe gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.""]","by

The mega-popular Super Robot Wars (a.k.a. Super Robot Taisen) series comes to the PSP with Super Robot Wars Advance Portable. An enhanced port of the popular Game Boy Advance game, Super Robot Wars Advance Portable provides the expected tactical RPG gameplay, while delivering one of the franchise\'s most classic stories. As usual, the action takes place on a hexagonal grid, with cleverly animated cutscenes depicting each robot\'s special attacks. Professional voice actors, many revisiting characters they voiced on the respective anime, add to the series\' trademark fun.\nPlayers can select from two original characters, each of whom interact with the lead characters from a multitude of popular robot anime franchises. As Axel Almer, the player is a member of the mysterious organization ""Shadow-Mirror"", who travels from an alternate dimension with as-yet unknown plans. However, his travel results in amnesia, causing Axel to doubt his status as a Shadow-Mirror member. As Lamia Loveless, the player inhabits an android developing her own cognitive decision-making ability. Each character reveals a different viewpoint on the game\'s story, meaning the player must play through twice to get the complete story.\n\nAs always, the main draw with a Super Robot Wars game is the roster of fan-favorite characters and robots. Super Robot Wars Advance Portable features robots from three incarnations of Getter Robo, including Getter Robo, Getter Robo G, and Shin Getter Robo. The Gundam franchise is represented by mechs from Gundam, Zeta Gundam, ZZ Gundam, The 08th MS Team, Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz, G Gundam, Char\'s Counterrattack and 0083 Stardust Memory. Also making appearances are mechs from UFO Robot Grandizer, Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger, Dragonar, Combattler V, Martian Successor Nadesico, and more!']","by

It is a shoot 'em up that features two-dimensional (2D) graphics. The game is set in the year 2084, in a fictional world where robots have turned against humans in a cybernetic revolt. The aim is to defeat endless waves of robots, rescue surviving humans, and earn as many points as possible.\nThe designers, Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar, drew inspiration from other popular media: Nineteen Eighty-Four and Berzerk. A two joystick control scheme was developed to provide the player with more precise controls, and enemies with different behaviors were added to make the game challenging. Jarvis and DeMar designed the game to instill panic in players by presenting them with conflicting goals and having on-screen projectiles coming from multiple directions.\nRobotron: 2084 was critically and commercially successful. Praise among critics focused on the game's intense action and control scheme. The game is frequently listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to the video game industry. Robotron: 2084 arcade cabinets have since become a sought-after collector's item. It was ported to numerous platforms, inspired the development of other games, and followed by sequels.\nThe game is considered by many to be an unofficial part of the company's Defender saga, including by many of its developers.""]","by

For those of you that can\'t speak Japanese, Kuru Kuru Kurunin loosely translates into ""Crazy Stick Game""--well, not really, but that\'s the best description you\'re going to get. Put simply, the game is based around the idea that you are a duck, and that this duck, apart from having a plethora of friends, drives a space ship that resembles a long stick (stay with us on this one--it gets better). Your task is to control the duck\'s spaceship through a series of tunnels to get to the end of the level. The only problem is that your spaceship is constantly spinning and the tunnel doesn\'t always stay the same width as the spaceship. As you progress through the game, the tunnels get harder, with you having to avoid objects, bounce off springs and basically muster all your prowess in later levels to get by. With three lifelines, the game\'s concept is fairly simple and yet for some strange reason very addictive. You can\'t help but think that you\'ll crack it on the next go and three hours later still be trying. Very Japanese in its creation, this is certainly one of the more entertaining and original GBA launch titles.--Jason Denwood']",Nintendo,"['>#66,395 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#714 in Video Games &gt; More Systems &gt; Game Boy Advance &gt; Games']",,Video Games,B00005JGCJ

In addition, for the first time in the Transformers universe, players can also fight the epic war between Autobots and Decepticons online in explosive multiplayer combat. <p/> <b>The Story</b><br/> Set a few years after the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, <i>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen Decepticons</i> reveals that the threat from the Decepticons is in fact, far from ended. Since the time of the epic and apparently not so final battle between the two Transformer leaders, Decepticons have started popping up again all over Earth in alarming numbers. And now, a mysterious object from space seems destined to shift the balance of power and give the upper hand to the Decepticons. <p/> <b>Mission-centric Gameplay</b><br/> Gameplay in <i>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen Decepticons</i> is structured around varied mission play. The variety in these missions comes from the fact that the available play options both parallel the events of the movie at times, as well as focus on events unique to the game. During these missions players will be able to play as a variety of different Transformers, and with success in mission play will be able to unlock additional Transformers and earn points used to upgrade their selected faction. Playable characters include: Starscream, Grindor, Long Haul, and Megatron. In addition, the game features a simple control toggle that not only allows for quick switching between mech, vehicle and weapon forms, but also allows for a more easy learning curve of the acrobatic moves from the movie. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>The Choice is Yours</b> &ndash; Players can step into the shoes of their favorite Decepticons, such as Starscream, Grindor, Long Haul, and Megatron, along with other surprise characters that may may an appearance. As they proceed, players will unlock additional missions and items creating a whole new experience with each character chosen.</li> <li><b>Outmaneuver Your Opponents</b> &ndash; Instantaneously convert from a colossal robot to a dynamic land or air vehicle such as a diesel truck, sports car, military chopper or fighter jet. New, ultra-fluid transformations can be performed in-motion anytime and anywhere, allowing players to strategically propel through and decimate hordes of enemies with incredible agility.</li> <li><b>Decepticon-centric Action</b> &ndash; Unique DS exclusive Decepticon-centric storyline, missions and characters.</li> <li><b>Online Multiplayer</b> - Compete with up to 4 players via Wi-Fi connection, including those playing the companion DS game <i>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen Autobots</i>.</li> <li><b>Demolish Your Enemies</b> &ndash; Each Transformer can unleash a unique array of assaults on its enemies ranging from powerful missile attacks and rapid-fire chain guns to explosive energy blasts and visceral melee strikes, allowing players to pick from a variety of weapons and moves in their character\'s arsenal that deliver diverse gameplay in every brutal encounter.</li> <li><b>Intense, Heroic Missions</b> &ndash; Every second is precious as players drive, fly, fight and blast their way through gripping, pulse-pounding levels straight from the film and beyond to determine the ultimate fate of the world.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Existing in forms as diverse as gems, beasts and even weapons, they were so numerous and their power so great that the civilizations of the world sprang up around them. But as people diverted the power of these objects for their ends they eventually caused a rift in the world\'s balance. Now, thousands of years later that balance must be corrected, and the story of <i>The Last Remnant</i> begins. <p/> Rush Sykes and his sister Irina are children of scientists researching the esoteric Remnants. One day, Irina is kidnapped right before Rush\'s eyes. Determined to rescue his sister, Rush joins forces with David Nassau, the marquis of a small city-state called Athlum. Together they are determined to pursue the criminals and save Irina from her strange captors. Meanwhile, the world is thrust into confusion as ruling powers bicker over dividing the Remnants\' powers. Soon a mysterious man appears calling himself the Conqueror. His presence escalates tensions as everyone eagerly attempts to answer the question: Into whose hands will the power of the Remnants fall? Before he knows it, Rush becomes wrapped up in this international power struggle and realizes that he is somehow connected to the enigmatic Conqueror. <p/> <b>Combat Systems: Battle Unions, Morale and Deadlock</b><br/> Battles in <i>The Last Remnant</i> are fought between multiple friendly and enemy unions -- groups of up to five characters who fight together and share resources and goals between them. Players give commands to unions as a whole, which then carry out the actions. Orders in battle are given in a command-select style that is familiar to most role-playing gamers. However, commands in <i>The Last Remnant</i> are not delivered with standard terms, such as ""Item"" or ""Magic."" Instead, players control unions with specialized commands, such as ""Slam \'em with status ailments!"" or ""Do area attacks from afar!"" Available commands change depending on the current battle situation or the distance and positions of friendly and hostile unions. <p/> <i>The Last Remnant</i> also adds a Morale component to the gameplay. Players can check current morale via the gauge across the top of the screen. The higher the morale, the more damage is dealt and less damage is taken by friendly unions and vice-versa. When friendly and enemy unions go toe-to-toe and engage in melee combat, they enter a state called Deadlock. Once in Deadlock, the two unions must fight each other until one union has been completely destroyed. Enemy monsters roam the land where they can be avoided or engaged at will. When battle is initiated, the scene changes to a specialized battle map where friend and foe can fight it out. Horizontal lined icons labeled A, B, C, etc. represent the on-field battle unions. Players choose which hostile union they wish to attack on this screen. Players will also utilize a wide variety of commands that focus on dealing damage or executing defensive maneuvers. Knowing which commands are most suitable for each situation is the key to winning battles. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li>Experience groundbreaking graphics, that bring the intensity of gameplay to an entirely new level.</li> <li>Uncover the mystery of the Remnants, powerful artifacts from an ancient civilization that are scattered around the world and stand as they were a millennia ago.</li> <li>Navigate a massive battlefield while surrounded by countless foes and friends.</li> <li>Immerse yourself in exhilarating, large-scale battles through a never-before-seen \'union-based\' battle command system.</li> <li>New features exclusive to the PC game version.</li> <ul> <li>Turbo Mode &ndash; Battles can be played out at twice the speed for faster game progression.</li> <li>No restrictions with leader units &ndash; enjoy more freedom when creating unions.</li> <li>New equipment preview feature &ndash; equipment can now be viewed before purchasing, purchase depending on stats and/or aesthetics.</li> <li>Your choice of voice acting &ndash; voices can be switched between Japanese and English.

What is a Mega Campaign you ask? Mega-Campaigns are specially designed and programmed campaign systems for Steel Panthers: World at War. Mega-Campaigns are non-linear; they branch into dozens of directions, depending on the victory level achieved by the player and also on his choices during play. In a Mega-Campaign, you not only face standard attack or defend types of battles, but many unusual missions and variants are also available for assignment. You may be sent to free POWs, or make an amphibious assault.\n\nYou'll find dozens of pictures, backgrounds, historical documents and insights included with each Mega-Campaign, plus numerous maps to help find out where you are. As you win (or lose) battles, a map will display each location for you. For exceeding valor you may receive special awards. You will find yourself immersed in the campaign and a stand-alone battle will never feel the same again. The fact is to truly get the feel of a Mega Campaign one must experience it.\n\nSP:WaW also includes a timed play feature, giving each player a specific amount of time to conduct his turn before it ends and his opponent's turn begins. Armor, gun and vehicle units are represented by individual icons. Each infantry squad can have up to 25 men in it. Machine guns, mortars and artillery units are also realistically portrayed and crewed. Each hex represents 50 yards (meters) of the virtual battlefield, with many new terrain features added. Each game turn represents a few minutes of real time, and games can last from a few turns to entire campaigns""]","by

Each bot has its own special abilities which will serve players well when they find themselves on the right terrain to take advantage of these. As with pretty much any racing game, a major goal is to complete the course at the highest speed possible, but players are also tasked with performing stunts and participating in mini-games. Players win bonus stars for crossing the finish line sooner, but stunts, style and these mini-games are as important as speed. For example: have you ever wished that you could play poker while racing? Think you can toss a dart or roll a bowling ball while leaving the competition in the dust? <i>ExciteBots</i> provides you with your chance. Stars can be traded for a variety of goodies, like new vehicles, tracks, icons and statues. <p/> <b>Control Schemes</b><br/> The control scheme of <i>ExciteBots</i> is easy and fun. The game can be played with just a Wii Remote or via the combination of a Wii Remote and a Nintendo Wheel accessory/any third party wheel. The 2 Button on the Wii Remote controller is the gas. The + control pad gives drivers a speed boost. Players turn the Wii Wheel accessory left or right to steer, tilt the Wii Wheel in midair to glide or to adjust pitch for perfect landings, swing the Wii Wheel in circular motions around boost bars to build up speed and press the A Button to activate items or to cash in hands in Poker Mode. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li>Special <i>ExciteBots: Trick Racing</i> bundle features included Nintendo Wii Wheel.</li> <li>The game takes the big-air thrills and simple pick-up-and-play controls of <i>ExciteTruck</i> and ramps up the fun with a constant barrage of funky challenges and mini-games performed at blinding speed.

Players can aim for and swing around boost bars or open presents that unleash a variety of wild items, such as bottle rocket boosts or clacker mouths that chomp on other racers to slow them down. <p/> <b>Mini-Games</b><br/> Now what about those mini-games. Do you know of any other game that features high-speed robotic racers combined with bowling, poker, clown faces and sandwich making? Didn\'t think so, but how do these game work? <ul> <li><b>Soccer</b>: Drive into the soccer ball and attempt to hit it into the goal.</li> <li><b>Bowling</b>: Drive through the pins and attempt to get a strike.</li> <li><b>Darts</b>: Line up your bot and let the dart fly. Try to hit bull\'s-eye in the distance.</li> <li><b>Clowns</b>: Hit the clown in the face with a pie by throwing it at just the right angle and speed.</li> <li><b>Sandwiches</b>: Drive through the ingredients in the proper order to make a delicious sandwich.</li> </ul> *Note that broadband access is required for online play. </td> </tr> </table>']","by

This is more complex than it seems though. The game contains many different kinds of Creeps, each with different abilities, meaning players must constantly be aware of which mazes and turrets are where, and be able to update these on the fly when necessary. <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""5""> <tr> <td width=""19%"" valign=""middle""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001U7B4UC.logo.250.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""118"" alt=""\'Desktop Tower Defense\' game logo"" align=""top""></td> <td width=""81%""><b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Eliminate Creeps</b> - Tactically place protective towers of differing defensive and offensive capabilities throughout the playing field, all while invaders known as ""creeps"" attempt to march across the screen.</li> <li><b>Hundreds of Levels</b> - Through strategic placement, carefully create mazes to ambush the invaders and protect their holdings through hundreds of challenging levels.</li> <li><b>Bigger and Better Turrets</b> - Upgrade your turrets to gain even more power.</li> <li><b>So Many Creeps, So Little Time</b> - Battle against group, flying, immune, spawn, dark and morph creeps all with different skills to challenge the best of players.</li> <li><b>Customization</b> - Create your own addictive experience by drawing towers and designing unique unrelenting ""creeps"" using the innovative technology of the Nintendo DS stylus, for a game experience of unending possibilities.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Screenshots</b>:<br/> <table cellspacing=""0"" align=""center""> <tr> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001U7B4UC.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;""><img alt=""Designing turrets in \'Desktop Tower Defense\'"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001U7B4UC.01.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Design your turrets.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001U7B4UC.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001U7B4UC.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;""><img alt=""Managing the battlefield in \'Desktop Tower Defense\'"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001U7B4UC.02.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Manage the battlefield.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001U7B4UC.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001U7B4UC.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;""><img alt=""In-game bonuses in \'Desktop Tower Defense\'"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001U7B4UC.03.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Earn in-game bonuses.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001U7B4UC.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001U7B4UC.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;""><img alt=""Designing Creeps in \'Desktop Tower Defense\'"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001U7B4UC.04.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center><span class=""caption"">Craft special Creeps.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001U7B4UC.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

As in most 3D platform games, you'll need to complete various objectives before advancing to the next level. These tasks range from finding an anthill to gliding across a riverbed canyon using only a dandelion.\n\nThroughout each level, Flik will have to battle various enemies on both the ground and in the air, including spiders, cockroaches, stink bugs, flies, beetles and grasshoppers. You'll also have to confront boss characters at the end of each act. Flik isn't defenseless though; he can throw berries, butt-bounce on enemies or simply run away from the danger. You'll also be able to pick up seeds and drop them wherever you want -- once you bounce on them, they'll grow into plants to help in your adventure.\n\nDisney/Pixar's A Bug's Life includes authentic voices from a majority of the movie's stars as well as an original music score.""]","by

The period starts with the French invasion of Italy in 1494 and the armies are still largely Medieval in weaponry and organization. While firearms and artillery are present on the battlefield they have yet to secure a dominant tactical role. By the close of the sixteenth century, traditional missile weapons such as the longbow and crossbow, had been supplanted by arquebuses (sometimes spelled harquebuses), muskets and pistols; while the proportion of firearms to pike had greatly increased since 1500. The pike, once the primary infantry weapon for many armies, and often a decisive battle-winner in the hands of professional Swiss and Landsknecht mercenaries was, by the close of the period retained primarily as a protection against cavalry, a role it continued to perform for another century until the invention of the bayonet made it redundant. With Renaissance, you can refight the Italian Wars between France and Spain as well as the various Anglo-Scottish battles of the 16th century, or lead Ottoman armies against Persians, Mamelukes and Western Christendom!
