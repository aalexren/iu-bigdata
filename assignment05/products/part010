Depending on how a weapon is equipped, it can be used as the main or sub weapon:<ul><li>Reflectors - These well-balanced weapons are suited for close range combat. <li>Rosaries- Sacred magatama beads are great for quick long range attacks. <li>Glaives - These can be charged up to unleash powerful close range attacks.</ul> <li>Intriguing main character - Assume the role of the sun god, Amaterasu, who descends upon the earth in the form of a wolf. The Japanese translation of the word wolf is ""Okami"". <li>Original visuals and revolutionary design- Vibrant and inspiring graphics, reminiscent of traditional Japanese art created on paper scrolls, produce a large variety of stages with a watercolor-esque appearance. </ul>']","by

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same. <p/> An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Built around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action in <i>infamous</i> contains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole\'s electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources. <p/> This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game\'s morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his \'bio-draw\' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players in <i>infamous</i> <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Be a Hero</b> - Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.</li> <li><b>Super Powers</b> - Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.</li> <li><b>Epic Battles</b> - Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.</li> <li><b>Open Dynamic World</b> - Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city. Players will be challenged to decide if they choose to save or destroy Empire City.</li> <li><b>Urban Exploration</b> - Scale the cityscape to discover new vantage points and employ a vertical combat system. Utilize Cole&rsquo;s climbing skills to go where most people can not, opening up a variety of offensive and defensive combat options.</li> <li><b>Organic City Ecology</b> - Watch the citizens and city react and evolve depending on players&rsquo; actions. Events will unfold based on the role players take in them, creating broader reactions in the city&rsquo;s people and environment.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

As you awake from a coma for the first time since that fateful day, you find the Stilwater you once ruled is in disarray. Unfamiliar gangs have laid claim to your territory, rival factions have taken over your rackets, and cash-hungry corporations have laid waste to your once proud 3rd Street home. Abandoned and left scarred with an unrecognizable face, you seek out a plastic surgeon to begin your new life on the streets. Yet some things never change in Stilwater. <p/>Respect can only be earned and that requires a lifestyle that reflects your unique personality. Your crib, your crew, and your character define who you are on the streets and how you are perceived. The image you portray is as important as the decisions you make in a city ruled by false bravado and impulsive behavior. The only constant is the need for an identity that reflects your individuality. But style and image can only take you so far in a world where actions speak louder than words. Sometimes sending a message to your enemies requires heavy lifting, like that of a rival gang member into oncoming traffic. Respect in Stilwater needs to be taken, and what better way than to grab it from the hands of a gang full of enemies by means of a satchel charge, a flame-thrower or those minigun rounds you\'ve been saving for a special occasion. <p/> <b>Meet Your Homies</b><br/> But remember that the fight to reclaim Stilwater does not have to be waged alone. The Saints once ruled these streets as a crew of brothers, and their return to the top can help be secured through co-operative alliances. The time has finally come to seek revenge against your rivals to reestablish your crew as the rightful kings of Stilwater, but the streets are crawling with bangers. Check out the crews you\'ll run into and remember their faces and their ways:<p/> <TABLE border=""0"" cellpadding=""5""> <TD width=""79""><img valign=""top"" alt=""The Third St. Saints - a gang of \'Saints Row 2\'"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sr2.saints.jpg"" width=""75"" height=""75"" align=""top"" hspace=""0"" vspace=""0""> </TD> <TD width=""850"" valign=""top""><b>3rd Street Saints</b><br/> Once the kings of the city, the Saints have been forced out of their titular home of Saints Row by the Ultor Corporation, a giant conglomerate that gentrified the once poor neighborhood.

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>White Knight Chronicles</i> is a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced. <p/> <b>Online Multiplayer</b><br/> Along with a compelling single player campaign, <i>White Knight Chronicles</i> also contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the wider <i>White Knight Chronicles</i> community on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town\'s population has for sale.

With the massive economic boom it receives, Russia quickly re-establishes itself as a superpower and restores her military might. In response most of Western Europe unifies to create the European Federation, a new nation destined to be a formidable 21st-century superpower. But things are also changing across the pond. In 2020, the United States is on the verge of finishing construction on the Freedom Star, a controversial orbital military platform that will upset the balance of world power.

Why? Civic pride? Perhaps, but the recent strange happenings in and around the park are casting doubt on that, doubts that require investigating.<p/><table width=""200"" cellpadding=""15"" align=""left""><tr><td align=""center""><img alt=""""Alone in the Dark"" game logo"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aitd-logo.jpg"" border=""0""><br><br><small><center><b><i>The return of an iconic series</i></b></center></small></td></tr></table><table align=right width=250 cellpadding=10><tr><td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aitd-01-lg.jpg""><img alt=""Edward Carnby"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aitd-01-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><small><center><b><i>Paranormal PI Edward Carnby.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aitd-01-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</i></b></center></small></td></tr><tr><td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aitd-02-lg.jpg""><img alt=""Stunningly spooky views of NYC"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aitd-02-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><small><center><b><i>Stunningly spooky views of NYC.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aitd-02-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</i></b></center></small></td></tr><tr><td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aitd-03-lg.jpg""><img alt=""The odd wildlife of Central Park"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aitd-03-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><small><center><b><i>The odd wildlife of Central Park.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aitd-03-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</i></b></center></small></td></tr><tr><td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aitd-04-lg.jpg""><img alt=""A whole new inventory system"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aitd-04-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><small><center><b><i>A whole new inventory system.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aitd-04-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</i></b></center></small></td></tr></table><b>Enter Edward Carnby, Paranormal Investigator</b><br/>Despite the title, <i>Alone in the Dark</i> is actually the fifth game in a series that dates back to 1992 and centers around the experiences of Edward ""the reptile"" Carnby. A paranormal investigator by trade, Carnby is looking for answers to the strange events and horrific creatures reported in and around the park, but gets more than he bargained for when all the mysteries and terrors of the park spill out over the course of one apocalyptic night. It?s the player?s task to avoid the new frightening dangers of the park as you search for the answers to what these supernatural occurrences mean and why they are happening.<p/><b>Gameplay Based on Full Player Immersion</b><br/>Packed full of action and vivid in its realism <i>Alone in the Dark</i> goes to the extreme to keep players engaged and immersed by plunging them into the heart of the action in real-time at every turn and challenging them to survive using full movement control. The goal here is to allow players to do or at least feel that they can do more or less whatever is possible in real life, within the game.<p/>Need to avoid a blast of steam or an eruption of fire that has shot up in your path? You can simply side-step it or you can handle the obstacle with a little more panache by using the environment around you, for example by swinging around it using reachable pipes or wires. In another situation you may be challenged by attacking monsters. No problem. You can take the path of least resistance, again by side-stepping them or placing an obstacle between yourself and them, but if you are feeling like taking out a little aggression you can pick up a board, chair, box, etc. and have at it. Nearly anything that you come across that would be usable in real life is usable in game and can be wielded in several different ways.<p/>In addition, game developer Eden Studios has done away with a few in-game conventions in favor of real life upgrades. Instead of old-fashioned health bars <i>Alone in the Dark</i> uses realistic body damage and physiological effects to show players how much damage has been done to Carnby by the new dangerous nightlife of Central Park. Basically this means if Carnby has been taking a licking he?s going to be a little bloody. Monsters use sensory perception of all kinds to find their victims, so players need to keep aware of Carnby?s physical state, as well as the impact he has on his surroundings. Also gone are traditional inventory systems that take players out of the game while you switch or check items in your possession, replaced by an in-game inventory system where items are carried in the folds of Carnby?s trench coat. This allows you to stay in the action the whole time. Sticking with the realism theme, the number of items that Carnby can carry is limited, but since ingenuity is built into the system, items can be combined or their uses altered, mostly with tape, so players can adjust as challenges arise.<p/><b>TV Style Intensity That Keeps You Hooked</b><br/>Built around a unique television style episodic narrative game structure, the storyline of <i>Alone in the Dark</i> is split into a number of distinct 30-40 minute episodes, doled out one at a time as you play. This new way to progress through the storyline ensures that players can enjoy the game regardless of the amount of time they have available without ever feeling lost. Each time a saved game is launched, the episode will begin with a video summary of the previous episode to quickly re-immerse the player in the story, removing the need to remember where you were or what you were doing at the end of your last play session. In addition, every episode will also close with a nail-biting, cliff-hanger ending to rattle players? nerves. And when you choose to leave the game, a video teaser of the next episode will play to leave players always wanting more.<p/><b>Vivid Photographic Rendering</b><br/>Even on a bad day, and this will be a bad one, Central Park and New York City are something to see. With Game developer Eden?s proprietary Twilight technology and rendering engine, players can expect to see everything from the City?s famous landmarks to the manifestations of the evil that have been festering in Central Park come to life as if you were there. This lavishly detailed game world takes advantage of highly realistic and advanced cinematographic effects including depth of field, camera focus, numerous light sources, moisture, reflections and High Dynamic Range effects.<p/>Whether it?s the innovative game play, the unique episodic game structure, the advanced physics or the return of a ground-breaking protagonist recast in the modern era, <i>Alone in the Dark</i> holds something for players willing to take on the mysteries and dangers at the heart of Central Park.<p/>']","by

Alone in the Dark - Xbox 360,,"['A New Inventory System  Players utilize the pockets of protagonist Edward Carnby to hold items which they can view, switch and combine without leaving the game.', 'Narrative intensity  Taking its cues from blockbuster TV dramas, the story is told in a TV season style narrative structure based around episodes that deliver maximum intensity throughout and keep the player hooked.', 'A Captivating Story  Centered in iconic Central Park long-time series protagonist and paranormal specialist Edward Carnby returns to delve into the frightening events occurring in the Big Apple.', 'Real World Rules  In-Game movement has been designed to allow players to do almost anything that is physically possible in the real world.', 'Photographic Rendering  Game developer Edens Propriety Twilight technology creates a lavishly detailed game world with highly realistic and advanced cinematographic effects.']","['Video Games', 'Xbox 360', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Alone in the Dark X360', 'There?s something strange and frightening happening in the middle of New York City?s Central Park; something whispered to have been intentionally kept secret; something that players are compelled to explore in <i>Alone in the Dark</i>.', 'Known today as a safe haven for New Yorkers yearning for relief from the stresses of their chaotic metropolis, history records that Central Park was built on a useless swamp, yet as the New York City skyline hurtled towards the sky over the last 150 years, making the city the most expensive real estate in the world, the park has remained untouched. Why? Civic pride? Perhaps, but the recent strange happenings in and around the park are casting doubt on that, doubts that require investigating.', '', '<b>Gameplay Based on Full Player Immersion</b><br />Packed full of action and vivid in its realism <i>Alone in the Dark</i> goes to the extreme to keep players engaged and immersed by plunging them into the heart of the action in real-time at every turn and challenging them to survive using full movement control. The goal here is to allow players to do or at least feel that they can do more or less whatever is possible in real life, within the game.', 'Need to avoid a blast of steam or an eruption of fire that has shot up in your path? You can simply side-step it or you can handle the obstacle with a little more panache by using the environment around you, for example by swinging around it using reachable pipes or wires. In another situation you may be challenged by attacking monsters. No problem. You can take the path of least resistance, again by side-stepping them or placing an obstacle between yourself and them, but if you are feeling like taking out a little aggression you can pick up a board, chair, box, etc. and have at it. Nearly anything that you come across that would be usable in real life is usable in game and can be wielded in several different ways.', 'In addition, game developer Eden Studios has done away with a few in-game conventions in favor of real life upgrades. Instead of old-fashioned health bars <i>Alone in the Dark</i> uses realistic body damage and physiological effects to show players how much damage has been done to Carnby by the new dangerous nightlife of Central Park. Basically this means if Carnby has been taking a licking he?s going to be a little bloody. Monsters use sensory perception of all kinds to find their victims, so players need to keep aware of Carnby?s physical state, as well as the impact he has on his surroundings. Also gone are traditional inventory systems that take players out of the game while you switch or check items in your possession, replaced by an in-game inventory system where items are carried in the folds of Carnby?s trench coat. This allows you to stay in the action the whole time. Sticking with the realism theme, the number of items that Carnby can carry is limited, but since ingenuity is built into the system, items can be combined or their uses altered, mostly with tape, so players can adjust as challenges arise.', '<b>TV Style Intensity That Keeps You Hooked</b><br />Built around a unique television style episodic narrative game structure, the storyline of <i>Alone in the Dark</i> is split into a number of distinct 30-40 minute episodes, doled out one at a time as you play. This new way to progress through the storyline ensures that players can enjoy the game regardless of the amount of time they have available without ever feeling lost. Each time a saved game is launched, the episode will begin with a video summary of the previous episode to quickly re-immerse the player in the story, removing the need to remember where you were or what you were doing at the end of your last play session. In addition, every episode will also close with a nail-biting, cliff-hanger ending to rattle players? nerves. And when you choose to leave the game, a video teaser of the next episode will play to leave players always wanting more.', '<b>Vivid Photographic Rendering</b><br />Even on a bad day, and this will be a bad one, Central Park and New York City are something to see. With Game developer Eden?s proprietary Twilight technology and rendering engine, players can expect to see everything from the City?s famous landmarks to the manifestations of the evil that have been festering in Central Park come to life as if you were there. This lavishly detailed game world takes advantage of highly realistic and advanced cinematographic effects including depth of field, camera focus, numerous light sources, moisture, reflections and High Dynamic Range effects.', 'Whether it?s the innovative game play, the unique episodic game structure, the advanced physics or the return of a ground-breaking protagonist recast in the modern era, <i>Alone in the Dark</i> holds something for players willing to take on the mysteries and dangers at the heart of Central Park.', '']","by

Taking to the streets of New York City in search of answers, he quickly encounters a web of lies and vows to rip the truth from those who have hidden it from him and the world. <p/> A few other things that Alex also learns quickly is that he is not alone in possessing amazing abilities, that there is a secret war brewing in New York City and he is on its front lines. A deadly infection has spilled out of control and the government has seized the media to stop the spread of information and has placed New York under quarantine as martial law is instated; igniting a firestorm of combat, carnage and death. As he roams the city, he faces an ever growing army of infected creatures warped and changed by the virus. As it spreads, the virus overwrites the genetics of those it infects, warping and changing their form into something else, something that seems to have been planned. The answers he seeks appear to be tied to the virus, so he rushes to discover the truth behind it, but standing against him and his goal is Project Blackwatch. An elite army specialist force, they are tasked with halting the spread of the virus at any cost and are eager to bring Alex in dead or alive to determine his connection to it. It would seem that they are potentially both enemy and ally to Alex\'s cause. Will Alex assist Blackwatch in its hunt, or join forces with the virus and subjugate humanity, pushing his powers to the limit as the genetic shackles of humanity fall by the wayside? That choice is up to the player in <i>Prototype</i>. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br> In <i>Prototype</i> players engage in \'Deceive or Destroy\' gameplay. This allows gamers the choice to either blend in with the population and covertly progress through the story, or fully unleash Alex&rsquo;s powers, and move through New York City like a walking slaughterhouse, taking control of military vehicles, and causing destruction at every turn. <p/> Although Alex is literally strong enough to fling people and large objects around easily, his most intriguing power is his ability to \'consume\' people. In doing this he acquires their memories, abilities, and their appearance. New memories help him to solve the mystery of how he got the way he is, while new appearances allow him to shape-shift into new useful forms at will and abilities allow him to maneuver in parts of the game requiring specific skills in specific situations. In addition, Alex\'s consumption of people also facilitates his ability to transform his physical body and manipulate his senses. Most weapons acquired in this way are outgrowths from his appendages like exaggerated blades, shields, whips and claws used for brutal close combat, but consumption also allows for powerful abilities like thermal vision, which provides for vision through smoke and obstacles, as well as \'infected vision\' with which Alex can detect hotspots of viral infection throughout the city. <p/> <b>Key Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Fast and Deadly Combat</b> - Shape-shift your body to the situation at hand ... from claws to blades to hammers to whips, as you choose the right weapon for the situation. Change to shield or armor for defense or use advanced sensory powers (thermal vision, infected vision) to track your enemies.</li> <li><b>Over-the-top Locomotion</b> - Seamlessly and fluidly bound from building to building, run up walls, bounce off cars and everything in your path. Adaptive parkour lets you move freely through the open-world environments of New York City.</li> <li><b>Unique Disguising Abilities</b> - Consume anyone at anytime, take on their appearance and assume their memories and special abilities.</li> <li><b>Deep Conspiracy Driven Storyline</b> - Wake up with no memory of the past ... just mysterious powers and a link to a town in Idaho. Delve into the mysteries of your origin, the true nature of your power and your part in a conspiracy 40 years in the making.</li> <li><b>Parkour Inspired In-game Movement</b> - Alex Mercer\'s movements are inpired by Parkour, a mostly urban activity bordering on both art and martial arts that aims at moving the human body from one point to another as smoothly, efficiently and quickly as possible. Recent examples of it gained worldwide attention in chase scenes in the 2007 film ""Casino Royale.""</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Attendees at the National Model Railroad Association's August 2000 convention marveled at the game's painstaking attention to detail. But this game is not a model railroad game; it simulates the real thing. The game's developers traveled across the world with cameras and microphones in order to authentically capture the trains in their natural habitats. Train Simulator lets you experience the world's greatest trains in all their glory. Train aficionados can drive the train, run the rail yard, or dive in with the terrain editor and create the rail lines of their dreams. Or you can just sit back, relax, and admire the beautiful scenery and dreamy click-clack of the tracks. --Andrew S.

In CTF the objective is to obtain a briefcase of intelligence from the enemy team\'s base and return it to their own base while preventing the opposing team from doing the same. In the control point mode the objective is similar, only related to holding particular territories. To be successful in either the most important thing is to understand and use each character class in the best way possible.<p/><b>A Game That\'s a Class Operation</b><br/>Unlike other ""class-based"" games that offer a variety of combat classes only, <i>Team Fortress 2</i> features a wide variety of classes which provide a broad range of tactical abilities and personalities, and lend themselves to a variety of player skills. All nine playable character classes from the original game are available and although a few of these, like the Medic and Heavy generally work well with any mix of characters, overall each have particular strengths in offensive, defensive and support capacities. Each also will respond dynamically with different comical dialogue when in combat.<p/><u>The full character classes include</u>:<ul><li><u>Pyro</u> - An offensive class with average damage tolerance, Pyros are armed with a flamethrower, shotgun and a fire axe.<li><u>Engineer</u> - A defensive class with a low threshold for damage, Engineers can upgrade weapons and equipment and are armed with a shotgun, a pistol and a wrench. <li><u>Spy</u> - Used for sabotage the Spy carries a revolver, a butterfly knife, an electronic zapper and a diguise kit.<li><u>Heavy</u> - Tough on offense and defense the Heavy\'s weapons are the minigun, the shotgun and his fists.<li><u>Sniper</u> - A support class with low damage tolerance, the Sniper is armed with a sniper rifle, a submachine gun and a machete.<li><u>Scout</u> - The Scout is fast but susceptible to damage. His weapons are a sawed off shotgun, a pistol and a baseball bat.<li><u>Soldier</u> - A slow, but a powerful offensive class, the soldier wields a rocket launcher, a shotgun and a spade. <li><u>Demoman</u> - A defense class with an average amount of protection, the Demoman is armed with a remotely detonated sticky bomb and a bottle of Scotch.<li><u>Medic</u> - Medics keep other characters alive and are armed with a healing \'medigun,\' a syringe-firing launcher and a bone saw.</ul>The importance of the abilities of particular classes aside, far and away the dominant factor in <i>Team Fortress 2</i> and the secret to its popularity, is its clear dedication to fun. This is seen in its rejection of realism in favor of cartoon-style art in the game\'s graphics, the inclusion of super weapons like lasers and missile launchers hidden within the six standard maps and the attention given to each character\'s incidental trash talking functionality. Combined, these simply make for fast-paced, over-the-top fun which are the building blocks of any multiplayer shooter.<h4>System Requirements:</h4><center><table border=1 cellpadding=""3"" width=50%><tr><td></td><td align=center><b>Minimum Specifications:</b></td><td align=center><b>Recommended Specifications:</b></td><tr><td>OS:</td><td colspan=2 align=center>Windows Vista/XP/2000</td></tr><tr><td>Processor:</td><td align=center>1.7 Ghz Processor</td><td align=center>Pentium 4 Processor (3.0 Ghz or better)</td></tr><tr><td>RAM:</td><td align=center>512 MB RAM</td><td align=center>1 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td>Video Card:</td><td align=center>DirectX 8 level Graphics card</td><td align=center>DirectX 9 level Graphics card</td></tr><tr><td>Other:</td><td colspan=2 align=center>DVD-ROM Drive/Mouse/Keyboard/Internet Connection</td></tr></table></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>']","by

Join the Color Revolutionaries to refine your skills while making a mess. The race to rescue Chroma City has just begun, and only de Blob can save the world from a black-and-white future.<p/> <b>Gameplay: de Blob\'s Primary Goal</b><br/> <i>de Blob</i> is a 3D platformer where players use the Wii Remote/Nunchuck combo to maneuver their hero, de Blob. Equal parts amorphous blob of paint, struggling artist, revolutionary and juvenile delinquent, de Blob\'s goal is to replace the drab, lifeless gray coloring that the I.N.K.T. Corporation has imposed on Chroma City and its inhabitants, the Raydians, with a range of vibrant life-giving colors, all the while avoiding and battling the gray-clad forces of the Inkies. <p/> Players must acquire paint and hurl de Blob at the buildings, walls, statues, roads and skies above Chroma City. As de Blob bounces around, adding color wherever he lands, his supply of paint is depleted and he begins to dry out. As this happens players must collect more paint and rehydrate in pools and in front of hydrants scattered across the city. As the game starts access is limited to the colors red, blue and yellow, but these can be blended to create a number of other colors.

Although living in occupied WWII Paris, Sean is initially concerned only with the racing lifestyle and his friends within it. That all changes though when the Nazis kill his friends, and change his life forever. Seeking personal retribution on a Nazi officer and others involved, Sean\'s life soon becomes dominated by a need for payback, which is exacted with the help of the French Resistance, British intelligence, an arsenal of weaponry, and your own street smarts and brawn. Motivated by retribution and armed with tactics of sabotage you are a one man wrecking crew, blowing up zeppelins, derailing trains, imploding bridges, destroying armored tanks, and leveling enemy facilities in the name of vengeance. <p/> <b>Open-world Gameplay</b><br/> <i>The Saboteur</i> in the first open-world, action game set in Nazi-occupied Europe, and combines a variety of different kinds of gameplay, including third-person shooter, stealth and racing. As in other open-world games, this means that although players will be tasked with completing an extensive list of set missions against Nazi units and individuals, they will also have the freedom to explore and fight throughout the game world as they choose. This world although set in Paris also encompasses the French countryside, as well as parts of Germany. Within it players will be able to use representations of actual landmarks &#151; for example, the Eiffel Tower &#151; for navigation, and a variety of vehicles for transportation and combat. In mission play, with each success players move closer to tracking down the particular Nazis responsible for the death of Sean\'s friends by putting the rewards that they receive for success to work on the black-market. They can trade for all sorts of items to help their progress, from weapons, to cars, maps and more. These all can also either be found throughout the game, or taken from defeated opponents, although the more commotion that is created and the higher the skills of the player, the greater the enemy response will be. <p/> <b>The ""Will to Fight"" System</b><br/> Although built around Sean\'s desire for personal revenge, <i>The Saboteur</i> also contains a play mechanism through which the lives of the non-player characters (NPCs) are improved, and can even be manipulated. This is the ""Will to Fight"" system. Long known as the ""City of Light,"" Paris as depicted in the game under Nazi occupation is a place dominated by stark black and white colors. These colors reflect the hopelessness of the people. But as the player collects victories against the invaders, a change will begin to be seen in the physical environments of the game, again reflecting the mood of the people. Where once there were only stark black and white colors and few civilians on the street, now players will see increasingly bright colors, reflecting the hope of the civilians and eventually incite an underground resistance among the Parisians to take up arms on their own, and even come to your aid when the odds are stacked against you. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Explore Open-World Paris</b> - Climb the Eiffel Tour, snipe from Notre Dame Cathedral, and brawl on the Champs d&rsquo;Elysee as you sabotage your enemies. Fight, climb, and prowl through the dark alleys, rooftops, burlesque houses, and seedy streets of the City of Lights&mdash;the ultimate playground for The Saboteur.</li> <li><b>Be the Saboteur</b> - Use a broad range of weapons and explosives to perform your blockbuster sabotage as you single-handedly hunt-down your enemies to dismantle and destroy the Nazi occupation.</li> <li><b>Stealth Gameplay</b> - Use gameplay systems like climbing, sneaking, and stealth Kills to infiltrate the Nazi occupation to perform acts of sabotage Once you\'ve blown your target to pieces, leverage the intuitive cover system and assortment of weapons to blast your way to freedom.</li> <li><b>Vertical World</b> - This version of Paris was designed to leverage the unique abilities of <i>The Saboteur</i>.

But to its credit game developer Double Helix refuses to rest on past laurels, choosing instead to include new more accessible gameplay in the hopes of gaining a new audience for <i>Homecoming</i>. Examples of this gameplay include:<p/><u>Next-Gen Visual and Spatial Features</u> - Every sequel seeks reinvent the namesake game in their series. <i>Homecoming</i> does this in three ways, by adding the ability to toggle between a traditional third-person view and an action-oriented first-person view; by adding fully 3-D physics to the game, creating a realistic range of motion for any and all objects impacted by the player; and by adding transitions or ""Hell States"" that alter the game\'s physical landscape at points in the game both in real-time and via cinematics. All three actively change the way players see themselves and in the process create a whole new game experience.<p/><u>An Enhanced Combat System</u> - Adding to the standard knives, axes, pipes and other melee weapons that made up the arsenal of previous <i>Silent Hill</i> games, <i>Homecoming</i> adds a wide variety of guns and explosives. Fitting with the military back-story of protagonist Alex Shephard, these weapons can be wielded in attacks weighted as weak or strong and can be strung together in combos to stun or incapacitate opponents, who can then be taken out with powerful finishing moves. With practice players can even perform evasive ducks and rolls and follow these up with counterattacks. But remember that enemy AI has also been significantly improved to compensate for your higher degree of combat prowess, and that it\'s not uncommon to battle multiple monsters simultaneously. <p/> <b>Key Features</b>: <ul> <li>Enter the next chapter of <i>Silent Hill</i> as you delve deeper in the tormented history of the town and learn of the evil that surrounds Toluca Lake.</li> <li><i>Silent Hill: Homecoming</i> is the 1st <i>Silent Hill</i> game designed for Xbox 360.</li> <li>From the murky fog to the ominous shadows, all-new next-gen graphics bring <i>Silent Hill</i> to life like never before.</li> <li>Survive the denizens of <i>Silent Hill</i> with an all-new enhanced combat system that gives you a wide array of attacks and counters.</li> <li>Solve the treacherous and deadly puzzles of Silent Hill to discover its darkest secrets.</li> <li><i>Silent Hill: Homecoming</i> will feature an all-new soundtrack by acclaimed series composer Akira Yamaoka.</li> </ul> <b>Exceptional Replay Value</b><br/>Although Alex Shepherd is the only playable character in <i>Silent Hill: Homecoming</i> there are many other important characters--some returning from earlier games in the series--that can have a dramatic impact on the game. When interacting with these, players are given a choice in how to proceed via dialog trees. Will you take the short route letting only the search for your brother guide you or will you explore the nooks and crannies that make up the mystery of <i>Silent Hill</i> hidden in the small talk you share with non-playable characters? The choice is yours, with different paths providing for possible alternate endings each time you delve into the game.<p/><b>A Frighteningly Masterful Soundtrack</b><br/>All games in the Survival-Horror genre seek to create tension and unease through sound and <i>Homecoming</i > does this masterfully through the compositions and sound engineering of Akira Yamaoka. Having scored the music and effects for dozens of video game titles, including all of the previous games in the <i>Silent Hill</i> series, Yamaoka is considered a master at using sound to illicit a response.<p/>']","by

From Shepherd\'s Glen to the foggy streets of dreaded Silent Hill, Alex must face the darkest of horrors in order to find his brother. Struggling with his own grip on reality, it\'s here that Alex must unravel the mystery behind his nightmares, discover the truth behind his brother\'s disappearance, and confront the evil that takes hold of his own flesh and blood in the process.<p/> <b>Improved Gameplay</b><br/>Firmly steeped in the Survival-Horror genre its series has been pivotal in establishing, action in <i>Homecoming</i> remains based on exploration of the terrors residing in the communities surrounding Toluca lake and puzzle-solving skill as a means of surviving them. But to its credit game developer Double Helix refuses to rest on past laurels, choosing instead to include new more accessible gameplay in the hopes of gaining a new audience for <i>Homecoming</i>. Examples of this gameplay include:<p/><u>Next-Gen Visual and Spatial Features</u> - Every sequel seeks reinvent the namesake game in their series. <i>Homecoming</i> does this in three ways, by adding the ability to toggle between a traditional third-person view and an action-oriented first-person view; by adding fully 3-D physics to the game, creating a realistic range of motion for any and all objects impacted by the player; and by adding transitions or ""Hell States"" that alter the game\'s physical landscape at points in the game both in real-time and via cinematics. All three actively change the way players see themselves and in the process create a whole new game experience.<p/><u>An Enhanced Combat System</u> - Adding to the standard knives, axes, pipes and other melee weapons that made up the arsenal of previous <i>Silent Hill</i> games, <i>Homecoming</i> adds a wide variety of guns and explosives. Fitting with the military back-story of protagonist Alex Shephard, these weapons can be wielded in attacks weighted as weak or strong and can be strung together in combos to stun or incapacitate opponents, who can then be taken out with powerful finishing moves. With practice players can even perform evasive ducks and rolls and follow these up with counterattacks. But remember that enemy AI has also been significantly improved to compensate for your higher degree of combat prowess, and that it\'s not uncommon to battle multiple monsters simultaneously. <p/> <b>Key Features</b>: <ul> <li>Enter the next chapter of <i>Silent Hill</i> as you delve deeper in the tormented history of the town and learn of the evil that surrounds Toluca Lake.</li> <li><i>Silent Hill: Homecoming</i> is the 1st <i>Silent Hill</i> game designed for PlayStation 3.</li> <li>From the murky fog to the ominous shadows, all-new next-gen graphics bring <i>Silent Hill</i> to life like never before.</li> <li>Survive the denizens of <i>Silent Hill</i> with an all-new enhanced combat system that gives you a wide array of attacks and counters.</li> <li>Solve the treacherous and deadly puzzles of Silent Hill to discover its darkest secrets.</li> <li><i>Silent Hill: Homecoming</i> will feature an all-new soundtrack by acclaimed series composer Akira Yamaoka.</li> </ul> <b>Exceptional Replay Value</b><br/>Although Alex Shepherd is the only playable character in <i>Silent Hill: Homecoming</i> there are many other important characters--some returning from earlier games in the series--that can have a dramatic impact on the game. When interacting with these, players are given a choice in how to proceed via dialog trees. Will you take the short route letting only the search for your brother guide you or will you explore the nooks and crannies that make up the mystery of <i>Silent Hill</i> hidden in the small talk you share with non-playable characters? The choice is yours, with different paths providing for possible alternate endings each time you delve into the game.<p/><b>A Frighteningly Masterful Soundtrack</b><br/>All games in the Survival-Horror genre seek to create tension and unease through sound and <i>Homecoming</i > does this masterfully through the compositions and sound engineering of Akira Yamaoka. Having scored the music and effects for dozens of video game titles, including all of the previous games in the <i>Silent Hill</i> series, Yamaoka is considered a master at using sound to illicit a response.<p/>']","by

Although living in occupied WWII Paris, Sean is initially concerned only with the racing lifestyle and his friends within it. That all changes though when the Nazis kill his friends, and change his life forever. Seeking personal retribution on a Nazi officer and others involved, Sean\'s life soon becomes dominated by a need for payback, which is exacted with the help of the French Resistance, British intelligence, an arsenal of weaponry, and your own street smarts and brawn. Motivated by retribution and armed with tactics of sabotage you are a one man wrecking crew, blowing up zeppelins, derailing trains, imploding bridges, destroying armored tanks, and leveling enemy facilities in the name of vengeance. <p/> <b>Open-world Gameplay</b><br/> <i>The Saboteur</i> in the first open-world, action game set in Nazi-occupied Europe, and combines a variety of different kinds of gameplay, including third-person shooter, stealth and racing. As in other open-world games, this means that although players will be tasked with completing an extensive list of set missions against Nazi units and individuals, they will also have the freedom to explore and fight throughout the game world as they choose. This world although set in Paris also encompasses the French countryside, as well as parts of Germany. Within it players will be able to use representations of actual landmarks &#151; for example, the Eiffel Tower &#151; for navigation, and a variety of vehicles for transportation and combat. In mission play, with each success players move closer to tracking down the particular Nazis responsible for the death of Sean\'s friends by putting the rewards that they receive for success to work on the black-market. They can trade for all sorts of items to help their progress, from weapons, to cars, maps and more. These all can also either be found throughout the game, or taken from defeated opponents, although the more commotion that is created and the higher the skills of the player, the greater the enemy response will be. <p/> <b>The ""Will to Fight"" System</b><br/> Although built around Sean\'s desire for personal revenge, <i>The Saboteur</i> also contains a play mechanism through which the lives of the non-player characters (NPCs) are improved, and can even be manipulated. This is the ""Will to Fight"" system. Long known as the ""City of Light,"" Paris as depicted in the game under Nazi occupation is a place dominated by stark black and white colors. These colors reflect the hopelessness of the people. But as the player collects victories against the invaders, a change will begin to be seen in the physical environments of the game, again reflecting the mood of the people. Where once there were only stark black and white colors and few civilians on the street, now players will see increasingly bright colors, reflecting the hope of the civilians and eventually incite an underground resistance among the Parisians to take up arms on their own, and even come to your aid when the odds are stacked against you. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Explore Open-World Paris</b> - Climb the Eiffel Tour, snipe from Notre Dame Cathedral, and brawl on the Champs d&rsquo;Elysee as you sabotage your enemies. Fight, climb, and prowl through the dark alleys, rooftops, burlesque houses, and seedy streets of the City of Lights&mdash;the ultimate playground for <i>The Saboteur</i>.</li> <li><b>Be the Saboteur</b> - Use a broad range of weapons and explosives to perform your blockbuster sabotage as you single-handedly hunt-down your enemies to dismantle and destroy the Nazi occupation.</li> <li><b>Stealth Gameplay</b> - Use gameplay systems like Climbing, Sneaking, and Stealth Kills to infiltrate the Nazi occupation to perform acts of sabotage Once you\'ve blown your target to pieces, leverage the intuitive cover system and assortment of weapons to blast your way to freedom.</li> <li><b>Vertical World</b> - This version of Paris was designed to leverage the unique abilities of The Saboteur. Being a saboteur is all about surprise attacks and Paris\' rooftops are the perfect path for your secret operations.</li> <li><b>The ""Will to Fight"" System</b> - <i>The Saboteur</i> introduces a innovative new feature that is both an iconic visual style, and a compelling gameplay element.

A group of rebels calling themselves the Red Faction had overthrown the ruthless Ultor Corporation after years of oppression. The EDF responded by launching a fleet of warships to Mars to aid the miners, bring Ultor to justice and restore order to the Martian colonies. In order to ensure safety and security for the newly liberated colonists, the EDF set up command posts and bases across the planet. Initially, under the EDF\'s rule, the people of Mars prospered: colonists established homesteads, built towns and independent mining operations and began to stake and work their mining claims. But the more things change on Mars, the more they stay the same. <p/> The troubles began with colonists being driven from their homes and mining claims by greedy, Earth-based corporations. Then came a 50 year turn of events that saw the EDF adopting the heavy-handed tactics that it once stood against. Yet in doing so it also instilled a deep-seated resentment among the miners and settlers of the Martian colonies. One of these new Martians is miner Alec Mason, whose dream of a new life carved out of the course Martian soil was crushed in the face of EDF-ordered curfews, detention centers, beatings, mass arrests and personal tragedy. But as powerful as the EDF is, there is resistance. Mason and a small group of revolutionaries have banded together, taken up the Red Faction name and pledged to again bring about a free Mars. And though their enemy has changed, their battle cry remains unchanged: ""Better Red than Dead.""<p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Join the Revolution</b> - When the citizens of Mars can no longer bear the injustice of an oppressive regime, the fate of the planet lies in the hands of Alex Mason and the Red Faction.</li> <li><b>Open World Guerilla Warfare</b> - You decide who, when, where and how to battle. Utilize guerilla tactics, improvised weaponry, and modified vehicles to lead insurgent attacks on EDF targets. Launch attacks based on your own gameplay style, take on missions in any order you choose, or engage in destructive activities to weaken the EDF&rsquo;s grip on Mars.</li> <li><b>Geo-Mod Technology 2.0</b> - Use destruction to your tactical advantage, setting ambushes or chain reaction explosions to attack enemy strongholds and permanently modify the game environment. Leverage fully-dynamic physics-based destruction to improvise on the fly: blow holes in a wall or floor to set an ambush or escape, take out a staircase to stop your pursuers, or drive vehicles through blown out walls.</li> <li><b>Evolving &amp; Emergent Gameplay</b> - Carve your path through an ever changing landscape as you improvise your combat tactics &ndash; mixing gameplay styles, vehicles, weapons and explosives to defeat the EDF.</li> <li><b>Epic Sci-fi Setting</b> - Explore the huge, unforgiving Martian landscape, from the desolate mining outpost of Parker to the gleaming EDF capital city of Eos; then tear through the fully destructible open-world environments swarming with EDF forces, Red Faction resistance fighters, and the downtrodden settlers caught in the crossfire.</li> <li><b>Multiplayer Combat</b> - There is no place to hide when you put your guerilla warfare skills to the test in a variety of highly destructive 2-16 person online multiplayer combat modes.</li> <li><b>Xbox LIVE Support</b> - Build your Xbox 360 gamer score, achievements collection and leaderboard placement through full Xbox LIVE support.</li> </ul> <b>Guerilla Warfare</b><br/> You don\'t stand a chance against the EDF using standard military tactics. The only recourse when the few stand against the many is the use of hit and run tactics. Learn the routes of the patrols and quickest ways in and out of EDF strongholds. By studying these things you can instinctively know when to attack, and when to wait for a better opportunity. <p/> Ambushes are also useful in thinning EDF ranks. Remote charges and proximity mines are your best friend when preparing an ambush. A few well-placed charges on the structural supports of a bridge can do wonders for stopping a convoy dead in its tracks. Above all else, remember this: guerilla tactics are not about fighting fair, they are about winning. </td> </tr> </table>']","by

The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous &#145;Ghost of Sparta&#146; as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. In <i>Chains of Olympus</i> Kratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt. Olympus.<p/><b><i>God of War\'s</i> Epic Gameplay Comes to the PSP</b><br/>PlayStation Portable has always been head and shoulders above its competitors in the handheld market when it comes to processing power, and in <i>God of War: Chains of Olympus</i> the PSP platform may just have reached its highest level to date. Packed with features like dramatic camera angles, epic set pieces, cinematic cut scenes, stirring audio and seamless fast action gameplay, formerly only available on console platforms <i>Chains of Olympus</i> binds players to the game&#146;s epic adventure, regardless where they are when they join in the action.<p/><b>Combat Moves, Both Old and New</b><br/>Nearly as defining as the name of Kratos itself, the trademark sweeping attack moves of the &#145;Ghost of Sparta&#146; using his weapon of choice the &#145;Blades of Chaos,&#146; epitomizes all <i>God of War</i> games and <i>Chains of Olympus</i> is no exception.<p/>Although overall the PSP has fewer buttons than the PlayStation 2 controller, developer Ready at Dawn Studios has managed to incorporate nearly all of the attack moves and combination moves from previous games in the series into this new project. This continuity in gameplay not only provides a seamless intro into the game for veteran players, but a gentle learning curve for players new to the series. Add to this new brutal combat moves and an additional upgradable weapon and you have a combat system that will engage players at all levels.<p/><b>Exploration and Puzzle Solving</b><br/>From the bright gates of Attica to the darkest dungeons of Tartarus, Kratos&#146; journey and your own will take you through the dark and brutal world of Greek mythology. Here not only will your skill with the Blades of Chaos be tested, but your wits as well.<p/>As you explore the dangers of the ancient world, players must be prepared to use their navigational skills as they press on through labyrinths of challenging puzzles. Some may be simple tests at manipulating the game&#146;s environment to your advantage, while others much more difficult also requiring precision timing of moves, but each will be different and test you in new ways.<p/><b>An Evolution in Franchise History</b><br/>More than just a missing piece in the history of the <i>God of War</i> franchise, <i>Chains of Olympus</i> also serves as an evolutionary link between the origins of the <i>God of War</i> franchise and its future. Originally developed for PlayStation 2, the future of the franchise is slated to make its arrival on PlayStation 3 in the form of the highly anticipated <i>God of War III</i> in the not too distant future. Not only is PlayStation Portable designed to work in unison with PlayStation 3 in many ways, but both long-time fans and newcomers to the series who choose to watch and play <i>Chains of Olympus</i> carefully may very well pick up clues as to the direction the franchise will be heading in with <i>God of War III</i>.<p/>Regardless, whether you find yourself playing for the current chapter in Kratos&#146; saga or preparing yourself for the battles to come on the PlayStation 3, <i>God of War: Chains of Olympus</i> is a must have title for any current owner of a PSP or those consid ering getting in the handheld game with one.<p/>']","by

Those inclined towards the side of good may fight for the Realm of Order as an obstinate Dwarf, noble High Elf, or loyal human soldier of the Empire. Those inclined towards darker deeds may side with the sinister Realm of Destruction as a savage Greenskin (Orc o r Goblin), corrupt Dark Elf, or marauding human worshiper of Chaos. RvR combat takes place on three fronts where ancient foes wage an unending war &#150; Dwarfs vs. Greenskins, High Elf vs. Dark Elf, and Empire vs. Chaos. Players begin the game fighting their ancestral enemy, but are free to journey to other fronts to help their allies in their ongoing struggles.<p/>The ultimate goal in RvR combat is the sacking of the enemy&#146;s capital city. To do this, an army must invade and take control of the opposition&#146;s homeland. Deciding battles take place in the persistent game world on objective-based battlefields and around fortified keeps that must be taken or defended, as well as in instanced Scenarios that contribute to zone control.<p/> <b>A New Way to Quest</b><br/>For the first time, players can engage in Public Quests; these community driven Player vs. Environment (PvE) quests help to advance the game&#146;s story and allow all allied players within a certain location to participate in an ongoing, multi-stage battle. This is an example of how every aspect of the game, including PvE content, is geared towards the greater war in some important way. Players are not required to participate in Player vs. Player (PvP) combat, and may aid in the RvR war effort and enjoy the game in its entirety via PvE content.<p/><b>Key Features</b><ul><li>Dominated by force of arms and magic, Games Workshop&#146;s popular <i>Warhammer</i> fantasy world provides a rich setting for hundreds of thousands of players to experience the epic nature of war and the glory of battle.<li>Join one of six armies and fight for the Realms of Order (Dwarf, High Elf and Empire) or Destruction (Greenskin, Dark Elf, or Chaos).<li>Never fight alone thanks to a next generation Realm vs. Realm (RvR) game system.

Players goal in singleplayer modes is first to make the squad, later progressing up its ranks and finally putting what you\'ve learned to good use as a choreographer.<p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li>1-4 player support.</li> <li>Use the Wii remote and nun-chuck to perform dozens of real-world cheer/dance moves.</li> <li>Full body cheer experience using the Wii Balance Board (optional).</li> <li>Compete and cooperate in squad and one-on-one cheer-offs.</li> <li>Customize the look of your team including facial features, hair, style &amp; color, make-up and outfits.</li> <li>Learn new moves and choreograph your own cheer routines to music.</li> <li>Grow your all-star squad to be the best and lead them to the championship as Cheer Captain.</li> </ul> <b>Varied Gameplay</b><br/> Gameplay within <i>All Star Cheer Squad</i> consists of players mimicking the stream of on-screen prompts, representing individual moves within a cheer routine, and accumulating points according to their accuracy. Action is registered through the use of various controllers. Ideally the game simulates a the range of body motion--both upper and lower--that a cheerleader utilizes. With this in mind, to take advantage of the game\'s full potential players should use both the combination of a Wii Remote with attached Nunchuck controller for upper body movement, and a Wii Balance Board for lower body movement. But this configuration is not mandatory for play. A Wii Remote with Nunchuck will suffice. Play options consist of: <p/> <u>Singleplayer</u> - Singleplayer action in <i>All Star Cheer Squad</i> comes in two varieties: Quick play and Career Mode. Career Mode on the other hand contains the lion\'s share of the singleplayer experience as well as the storyline of the game. As players begin this mode they choose the gender and basic customization options of their character like initial attire, facial features, etc. From there they are introduced to the current members of Fox Squad. Considered as an unproven rookie the players must try out and make the squad to gain respect and a spot on the team. If successful more advanced routines and moves as well as unique custom items will be unlocked, which will earn you credibility and provide the opportunity to move up in the hierarchy of the squad, eventually all the way to captain.

Created by the same team at Electronic Arts Canada that developed the award-winning <i>Fight Night Round 3</i>, the game contains a surprisingly deep control scheme that although very easy to pick up, is also full of nuances. Players use the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controller configuration to throw a variety of punch types, including jabs, body blows, haymakers, face shots and the infamous round-ending facebreaker. As in real boxing, all these punches are most effective when strung together as combinations. In addition, each boxer steps into the ring with his/her own special abilities and weaknesses. Master the basic range of punches and use your knowledge of both your character\'s and your opponent\'s weaknesses and strengths and you will be well prepared to be king of the ring. <p/> But remember that this <i>KO Party</i> is all about fun. Laugh out loud as you pummel your opponent with a barrage of blows to the face and watch in satisfaction as your progress is illustrated by real-time facial deformation. Taunt your adversaries and flaunt your talent, by tying one hand behind your back to add ultimate humiliation to your bout. In <i>FaceBreaker K.O Party</i>, it just feels good to rearrange your opponent\'s face. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Pick Up And Punch</b> - A hyper-intuitive, gesture based control scheme developed with 1:1 responsiveness and approachability in mind. Grab the Wii-mote and Nunchuck and feel the deep satisfaction of stringing together mug shots, body blows, and bone crushing Breakers. Dodge and Parry your opponents attacks and then unload on them with the Grand Daddy of them all&hellip;.The FaceBreaker.</li> <li><b>Punch-O-Matic</b> - Punch the bag as hard as you can to trigger the craziest punch party machine on the planet. Expect the unexpected in this multiplayer extravaganza where there are Power-ups a plenty, deadly stalking robots, and everything in between. No <i>KO Party</i> is complete without the awesomeness of the Punch-O-Matic.</li> <li><b>12 New Friends to Call Your Own</b> - If you are struggling to find friends in the real world, and even if you\'re not, 12 outlandish characters await for you to play with and against &ndash; each with unique attributes and character-specific special attacks.</li> <li><b>Multiplayer T.K.O. Battles</b> - The Ultimate team boxing battle. Draft 3 Champions to make up your team and battle in out with up to four-player team action. If your boxer is lucky enough to avoid being knocked out be careful because damage is carried over from bout to bout. Choose your Champions and Opponents wisely or you may end up being the first player to get T.K.O.\'d.</li> <li><b>Brawl For It All</b> Throw your hat in the ring for the most extremely extreme boxing tournament of all time. Put your skills to the test in this single player experience where you battle past every character in the game, earning belts, characters, costumes, and ultimate glory - along the way. It ain\'t called Brawl for it All for nuthin\'.</li> <li><b>Mess up yo\' Face</b> - After you beat your opponent to the mat add the ultimate humiliation by using your Wii Remote to brand your victory all over your opponents broken face.</li> </ul> <b>Playable Characters</b><br/> The in-your-face, world of <i>FaceBreaker KO Party</i> is ruled by its ego-wielding characters. In a nod to iconic arcade fighting games of the past, each boxer is packed with over-the-top personality and comes to life with unique attributes and a distinct sense of personal style. Just a few of the pugilists that players can look forward to meeting in the ring include, Romeo, a Latin lover known for his pelvic thrusts and Molotov, an oversized Russian demolitions expert with a penchant for fighting dirty. Get to know all twelve as you battle through this Wii party that packs some serious punch! <p/>']","by

Along the Atlantic coastline, a monster &#151; somehow familiar, yet still quite different from anything ever seen &#151; has been snatching little girls and bringing them back to the undersea city. It is a Big Sister, new denizens of Rapture who were once one of the forgotten little girls known as Little Sisters, known to inhabit the city\'s dank halls. No longer a pawn used to harvest ADAM, the dangerously powerful gene-altering lifeblood of Rapture, from the bodies of others and in turn run the risk of being harvested herself, the Big Sister is now the fastest and most powerful thing in Rapture. You, on the other hand are the very first Big Daddy, in fact the prototype, that for some reason has reactivated. You are similar to the Big Daddies familiar from the original <i>BioShock</i>, but also very different in that you possess free will and no memory of the events of the past ten years. The question is, as you travel through the decrepit and beautiful fallen city beneath the waves, hunting for answers and the solution to your own survival, are you really the hunter, or the hunted? <p/> <b>Gameplay and Multiplayer</b><br/> In <i>BioShock 2</i> players will take on the role of the original Big Daddy, not that of game one protagonist, Jack. As a Big Daddy you will have access to all the strengths and weapons of a standard Big Daddy, including the drill and rivet gun. More importantly you also possess free will and the ability to use plasmids and gene tonics &#151; genetic modifications allowed for through ADAM, a stem cell harvested from conquered enemies, or sea slugs outside the Rapture air lock, and powered by the in-game injectable serum known as EVE, which can be found, captured or purchased. Plasmids and gene tonics provide a wide range of aggressive and passive abilities which can be upgraded and arranged for quick use. The ability to use plasmids and tonics gives you a decided edge over other Big Daddies and most other denizens of Rapture, excluding the powerful Big Sisters. In addition, due to their role as a Big Daddy, players will experience a new relation to the Little Sisters. Upon defeating standard Big Daddys you are given the familiar choice as to whether to harvest or adopt them. Harvesting gains you ADAM immediately, but could alter your path through the game, while adopting makes you responsible for Little Sisters, who then accompany you through Rapture, but also provide aid and warning in times of danger. Additional gameplay features include: new plasmids, weapons and the ability to combine these two. <p/> The game also features the anticipated multiplayer modes. Several of these are team-based, allowing up to 10 players. Within these players are provided with a rich prequel experience that expands the origins of the <i>BioShock</i> fiction, and allows you to play as one of several characters pulled from Rapture\'s history before the events of the first game. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>The Big Sister</b> - No longer just something to be harvested or not, the Big Sister is the most powerful resident in Rapture.</li> <li><b>You Are the Big Daddy</b> - Take control with the original prototype Big Daddy, and experience the power and raw strength of Rapture&rsquo;s most feared denizens as you battle powerful new enemies.</li> <li><b>New Plasmids</b> - New plasmids such as ""Aero Dash"" allowing for bursts of speed over short distances, and ""Geyser Trap"" a stream of water used as a jump pad and electrical conductor, join the ample list of Plasmids from the original game.</li> <li><b>New Game Mechanics</b> - <i>BioShock 2</i> contains many new gameplay mechanics. Just a few of these are: the ability to wield plasmids and weapons simultaneously; flashback missions detailing how you became the Big Daddy; the ability to walk outside the airlocks of Rapture to discover new play areas, and many more.</li> <li><b>New Locations</b> - Just a few of the locations and environments debuting in <i>BioShock 2</i> are Fontaine Futuristics, headquarters of Fontaine\'s business empire and the Kashmir Restaurant.</li> <li><b>Evolution of the Genetically Enhanced Shooter</b> - Innovative advances bring new depth and dimension to each encounter, allowing players to create exciting combinations to fit their style of gameplay.</li> <li><b>Return to Rapture</b> - Set approximately 10 years after the events of the original BioShock, the story continues with an epic, more intense journey through one of the most captivating and terrifying fictional worlds ever created.</li> <li><b>Genetically Enhanced Multiplayer</b> - Earn experience points during gameplay to earn access to new weapons, plasmids and tonics that can be used to create hundreds of different combinations.</li> <li><b>Experience Rapture&rsquo;s Civil War</b> - Players will step into the shoes of Rapture\'s citizens and take direct part in the civil war that tore Rapture apart.</li> <li><b>See Rapture Before the Fall</b> - Experience Rapture before it was reclaimed by the ocean and engage in combat over iconic environments in locations such as Kashmir Restaurant and Mercury Suites, all of which have been reworked from the ground up for multiplayer.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by
