SpellForce features a unique blend of Real-Time-Strategy and Role-Playing-Game elements that bring a fresh perspective to the genre.', '<P>Little brings joy to my life like seeing an existing genre taken in a completely different direction. SpellForce does just that, and even does it pretty well. Like a lot of original efforts, though, it\'s a bit rough around the edges and has a number of flaws in execution.</P> <P>SpellForce basically consists of two interwoven games&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;one where you\'re trying to build up your avatar (a fully-statted warrior whose development is totally up to you), and another where that champion leads your massive armies into battle. These elements integrate rather well, but within each are a multitude of little flaws that make for a somewhat jarring experience.</P> <P>The RTS portion of the title, which is mostly very well-done, suffers from one problem that almost utterly kills my enjoyment of it: Unit AI is freakin\' terrible. In particular, the attack-move command barely works at all, making babysitting your armies a full-time job. If you have enough micromanagement skills to pay the bills you\'ll be fine, but RTS newbies will need a bit of patience to get the hang of it.</P> <P>There\'s a lot of things to praise this title for, as well. The persistent single player world, where sub-quests span several maps and characters appear throughout the story, is very cool. The interface is smooth and easy to navigate. The depth of customization for your avatar is immense. Unfortunately, without the execution to match these great ideas, SpellForce is merely above-average, rather than excellent.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Inject some RPG flavor into a real-time strategy stomp-fest <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>Nice &#8211; especially the lighting from buildings at night.

The game pulls off a few unique ideas pretty well, but it surprisingly fails in several of the areas that are critical in an RTS. The interface with your avatar and heroes is unique, and allows for easy management of your key units during battle. If you aren\'t directly controlling them all the time, though, the AI makes some alarming errors. The story is well-conceived and deep, but the plot is advanced through voice-acting that is, at best, shameful. The missions are intricate and fun, with some impressive strategy and broad gameplay options, but as I progressed I ran into little hang-ups (like the AI) all over the place that kept me from liking this game as much as I wanted to.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>7.75 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Joe Juba</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

It's old school, down and dirty 7-on-7 football where every player plays both sides of the ball, and it's up to you if you want to play superstars like Michael Vick at his natural quarterback spot, run him out wide for a pass, or line him up at safety. Created by Madden developer Tiburon, the game features 200 challenges, more than 300 current NFL stars, and multiplayer options for up to four."", 'Given the success of <a href=""/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00007UHDI/${0}""><i>NBA Street</i></a> it was only a matter of time before EA Sports took the street concept to its flagship sport, football.

Wap!', ""The game licenses all the NFL teams and some 100 big-league players. The characters models are exaggerated, so don't expect likenesses to be exact, but it's fun taking a bunch of current Packer greats and stuffing the rock down the throats of seven Rams. Game modes let you choose players from single teams or create your own pro bowl, and there is a nice assortment of QBs, RBs, corners, WRs, tight ends, and O and D-linemen. There's a lot of strategy in picking your team. Sure, running backs and quarterbacks are givens, but a corner can intercept better than a wide receiver though he won't catch as well. A big offensive lineman can be useful, but he doesn't tackle well when forced to play defense. When playing two-player, you can really stack your line and shut down the enemy passing or running attack, or go for a balanced corp."", ""You can play a ladder or league by creating your own team, which is annoyingly time consuming. An option to draft your own NFL stars and go through would be nice, instead you have to pick a cadre of nobodies and fill out their stats. Pick a name, a logo, and try to beat the pros with your average Joes. Winning gives you points and you can upgrade from there. It's a nice option but only for the hardcore players; casual players are effectively shut out from continuing play because of it."", 'EA hired ""street"" artists to design wonderful load screens, but this makes the player models look dull by comparison. One wishes they had used cel shading and that street look to the characters, but instead we get freakish players that generally look the same. Uninspired, un-intimidating, and, frankly, boring.', 'The gameplay works. There\'s a nice assortment of offensive, defensive, and trick plays. There are no special teams, no punting, and extra points are two points for a pass, one for a run. Mastering the buttons is key because the game rewards style, impressive plays, and more. Gathering these points opens new playing fields and, if you like, can be a victory option.

If you have a friend with a GBA you can go head to head, but otherwise the game will largely be a single player experience that gets really boring really fast. After going through once, often there just isn\'t any incentive to play again. King of Fighters EX2 addresses this problem by enriching the single player game in addition to having multiplayer versus and team battles. Each group of three combatants has a specialized ending, and characters gain experience and levels as they are used, ultimately leading to unlocking the boss as a playable character. Add to that a satisfying variety of cool (though sometimes difficult to execute) moves and the team-based play KoF is known for, and you have a solid fighting game that is worth sinking your fists into. <br /><br />Rated: <b>7.75 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Joe Juba</b><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0"" /></a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']",Atlus,"['>#54,316 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#515 in Video Games &gt; More Systems &gt; Game Boy Advance &gt; Games', '>#13,075 in Video Games &gt; PC Games']",$199.95,Video Games,B0000Y4138

The action is fast and intense, the shooting never stops and the ammunition doesn't run out. Gory, wild, over-the-top fun -- with the frenetic pacing and nonstop shooting action you love!"", '<P>I have to respect the Serious Sam franchise for knowing exactly what it is, and never mucking up its run-and-gun style with other considerations. With no stealth, few puzzles, and a very light story, Sam is about shooting stuff. Lots of stuff. Pretty much everything you see is there to be mowed down by the might of Sam\'s various guns.</P> <P>The core gameplay works really well. The weapons are fun to use, Sam\'s movement speed is nice and fast, and the sense of humor (the title for this game was originally Word to the Mothership) fits perfectly. To make the hordes of enemies more exciting to plow through, the new Killing Spree speeds you up if you&nbsp;kill 20 aliens in a short time frame. Plus you score double points, which makes the unlockables far easier to obtain.</P> <P>Hidden levels, new features, and cheats all await the dedicated gamer. However, it will take a seriously patient player to not only finish the game, but to go back and earn the gold medals. Almost all of the enemies can be defeated handily by strafing around them until they drop. The only tough parts are when you get swarmed by a flood of aliens (which happens all the time, of course), since it\'s difficult to maintain a situational awareness with baddies continually spawning behind you. This formula makes most fights feel very similar, despite the variety of weapons and enemies. Even with the new vehicles, it felt like I was whaling on the same enemies over and over. </P> <P>Multiplayer on either system does help to keep this vital, though there\'s nothing really innovative about it. It\'s still brainless shooting, except that it\'s your friends (or random strangers, on the PS2) that you\'re gunning down.</P> <P>Taking all of its flaws into account, the final tally still comes up in favor of Sam. Sure, it gets old, but $20 for a decently long single-player and well-done multiplayer is more than reasonable.</P> <P>The Edge</P> <P>There are two differences to be aware of here: graphics and multiplayer. The GameCube has the visual department firmly under control, with smoother play and various effects that don\'t show up on the PS2. Multiplayer\'s a toss-up; if online is your thing, PS2 is the way to go. The &#8216;Cube does have the four-player (as opposed to two-player) split-screen going on, so it\'s really up to personal preference here.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Circle-strafe to your heart\'s content, blowing up aliens all the while <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>Surprisingly smooth and crisp for a budget title <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>Repetitive, but not too annoying.

An absolute steal at $20, Sam dishes out a good time in bloody chunks of flesh and a humorous tone. The only problem I had was that it is hard to distinguish enemies that spawn behind you. I was surprised by this because sound detection of your foes is a huge part of the game\'s charm (it doesn\'t support surround sound). The vehicles I could take or leave, but the Super Combo Killing Sprees are a hoot. This is fitting, as Next Encounter is limited (not being a proper sequel), but you\'ll find that Sam\'s penchant for carnage fits like a glove.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>7.75 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Matthew Kato</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']",Nintendo,"['>#22,188 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#251 in Video Games > More Systems > GameCube > Games', '>#4,642 in Video Games > PC Games']",$199.95,Video Games,B00015HWTQ

Travel the world in search of contracts and utilize multiple strategies and weaponry to accomplish your task. Features an all-new graphics engine, weapon set and even more creative AI than ever before!', '<P>With a body count that doubles on each passing day, it was only a matter of time before Agent 47 cracked. In this third installment in the Hitman series, IO Interactive is inviting players to step into the mind of this ruthless contract killer and experience his mental anguish firsthand. Within the first few seconds the game, players bear witness to Agent 47 collapsing to the floor and losing consciousness. This spurs an interactive dream sequence set within a mental institution (which may seem familiar to those of you who played through the previous two titles). As Agent 47 fades in and out of consciousness, many of the stages that you will traverse represent a different memory in his tormented mind. Taking a stroll down memory lane, you\'ll perform the hits that shaped him into the hard-hearted killing machine that he is today. </P> <P>Invading Agent 47\'s brain is a clever idea that does help flesh out the character to a certain degree, but I had an incredibly difficult time following the plotline. As clichd as the previous two stories were, you couldn\'t help but fall in love with the events at hand. In this game, each passing second brought greater disinterest and a longing for the game to lose the artistic storytelling and get back to a hackneyed motion picture plot. </P> <P>The delivery of Agent 47\'s exploits is just the tip of the iceberg concerning material that doesn\'t sit well. Regarding gameplay, IO has made significant strides to open it up and grant players greater freedom of choice. No longer are you railroaded into using just one technique to perform a hit. You can usually find two or three methods that will work. While I did get a kick out of watching Agent 47 put someone down with a syringe to the neck or a pillow to the face, I mostly relied on running and gunning to clear out areas. The first-person element works much better this time around (although the gun graphics are still quite appalling), and your foes usually don\'t show the greatest of intelligence when they lay down an assault. You can usually lead them into a trap, and within seconds, have a pile of six or seven guards at your feet. Of course, the option to sneak through every stage undetected is still there, but you are rarely forced to duck out of sight.</P> <P>Without being coerced into using a specific technique, you just feel lost in Contracts\' massive levels. You\'ll often find yourself wandering aimlessly looking for the needle in the haystack that will complete the next objective. There really aren\'t any tense situations, calculated hits, or elements of surprise this time around.</P> <P>Making the gameplay less linear really threw a kink in the chemistry that worked so well in the first two games. All told, Contracts is an ambitious release for IO, but the end result is a garbled mess of a game that has lost its way.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Learn how Agent 47 became a contract killer through slightly confusing storytelling, and missions that are not nearly as taxing <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>The environment detailing and realism in the character models is outstanding, but the first-person gun graphics are downright appalling <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>The soundtrack and ambient noises are implemented brilliantly and add punch to the experience <BR><BR><B>Playability:</B><BR>Not nearly as demanding of skill.

However, it was a fairly linear adventure, forcing you to use a ton of trial-and-error and quick saving as you deliberately made your way through the levels laden with soon-to-be-deceased enemies. Hitman: Contracts seeks to give you more freedom, and in doing so largely loses what made the game compelling in the first place. In the opening level, you\'ll quickly learn that even if you blow your cover and alert the guards, it\'s easier to shoot your way out of a tight spot in the improved first-person view than it is to be stealthy. Also, given that it\'s hard to discern where you have to go to complete certain level goals, you often end up wandering around, randomly picking off enemies instead of plotting a devious course to success. In this sequel, Hitman feels less like a great stealth title than a mediocre shooter with a few cool gadgets and abilities.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>7.5 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Matt Helgeson</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Between now and then, however, the series has gone through much more than a name change, and I\'m very disappointed by the transformation. The racing, in fact, has gotten better on several fronts, but TOCA has changed up its story structure and lost all the magic and appeal that once made the franchise stand out.</P> <P>The story cutscenes are now seen through your eyes instead of Ryan McKane\'s (the protagonist of the original). That\'s fine, but the developer has also done away with the hub world with its separate email and garage areas. Sounds like a small thing, but it\'s better than the simple and boring menu interface now in its place. Worst of all, there is little choice because the original\'s tier structure (and its pool of races) is gone. At times in TOCA you\'ll be asked to pick from different circuits. You can go race pick-up trucks at an oval or semis on a road course, for example. I\'m glad that the franchise has retained its variety and racing versatility, but without a good story context, the magic of the first Race Driver is lost. Also, because the tier structure and email challenges are gone, the game is more linear. In the end, I felt like the cutscenes were driving the story, and not my choices.</P> <P>Codemasters has dialed down the difficulty, which is welcome, but has not sacrificed the intricacy of cars\' handling. The more high performance cars and rally races are good cases in point. You have to know both when and how to slam on the throttle in order to get the most out of a car. Visually, the details abound and the sensation of speed is good. If you\'ve got a high-def TV, you have to take advantage of the game\'s support of 480p, as it adds an extra dimension that must be experienced. You can make your car a sight to see by beating the living hell out of it, but I was hoping that TOCA would make vehicle damage a more meaningful aspect than in the first Race Driver.</P> <P>The game\'s peripheral importance on being able to damage your car is a good example of why this sequel isn\'t as fun as the original.

It was also refreshing to see a game trying new things, mixing turn-based strategy with platforming elements and massively destructible environments. Unfortunately, things went sour quickly when it became clear that none of these innovative features came together well, resulting in a smoking wreck of ideas that should have been fun.</P> <P>The game\'s premise is pretty basic: a small group of good guys fight off an overwhelming alien force. Despite the simple setup, Future Tactics is surprisingly difficult, but not in that good ""this game is challenging my strategic combat skills"" kind of way. The monsters are overpowered, can communicate telepathically (which means if one sees you, they all do), and often respawn once they are destroyed. On the other hand, your characters are few, weak, and the death of a single one can mean game over. The result is numerous frustrating losses rooted in poor game balance rather than tactics.</P> <P>Don\'t expect these problems to be lessened at all depending on which version you play; there are essentially no differences among the three. Even though the Xbox version is Xbox Live aware, there are no features that allow you to play against friends online. This means that Future Tactics is an identically mundane experience across the board. However, it does have a tempting $20 price tag, so if you really enjoy turn-based strategy and want to see an interesting new take on the genre, this could be worth a look.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Turn-based strategy meets generic 3D action <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>They are either overly stylized, or just plain bad.

The aiming system was conceptually interesting, but adjusting the floating reticle quickly grew so tiring that I stopped going for perfect shots, and was left with a wholly unappealing gaming mess. The graphics can only be described as awful, missions are boring, and combat ranges from dull to frustrating. The enemy AI is terrible, as is the fact that losing one unit can end the game.

I know I sure have. Of course, when I was a kid, my spy missions mostly involved trying to successfully sneak past the neighbor\'s dog. Fortunately, Rex was old and couldn\'t run very fast. Even more fortunately, spy games now have some more challenging tasks, thanks to Pandora Tomorrow. This handheld version of Sam Fisher\'s latest adventure stays true to the solid formula of the first GBA Splinter Cell, and features the plot of the new console version.</P> <P>In this new iteration, players must guide Sam through side-scrolling levels filled with guards, civilians, security cameras, and spotlights. Stealth is his greatest weapon, and he can press up against walls, crouch behind bushes, and climb drainpipes to avoid being seen. It goes without saying that this release isn\'t as deep as the console version, but it\'s still one of the most complex side-scrollers out there. Several minigames are incorporated into the quest, including rappelling, computer hacking, and lock picking. These segments add a lot of atmosphere to the game and keep things diverse. </P> <P>While the simple controls work well and the missions are mostly enjoyable, the frustration level is pretty high. The enemy AI is unpredictable; at some times they appear blind and deaf, while at others they seem to have eyes on the back of their heads. Since many missions end after a single alarm sounds, be prepared to play the same sections over and over. Certain enemies must not be killed in order to get information from them, but these foes sadly look the same as everyone else. Several times my mission ended simply because I punched the wrong guy. Obviously, I found this hugely annoying.</P> <P>While this title did make me swear like a sailor on several occasions, there is still much to praise. The environments are a little on the plain side, but character animation is simply stunning. The first time Sam grabs a hapless guard and shoves his face into a retinal scanner, you can\'t help but marvel at the fluid motions. Each move in Sam\'s deep repertoire looks great, and lends a realism to the game that helps it feel like a mature spy thriller. And although neither the sound effects or music is all that impressive, the voiceovers from the guards make up for that They may only shout ""hey,"" but it\'s still refreshing to hear actual voices on the GBA. </P> <P>Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is much like how I imagine real espionage (that doesn\'t involve sneaking past elderly canines) must be: often it\'s frustrating, but overall it\'s a worthwhile experience that\'s unlike anything else.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Sam Fisher\'s latest adventure is recast as a 2D side-scrolling handheld title <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>Character animations are easily some of the best to ever appear on the GBA <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>Like the recent Max Payne, it features actual voices on the GBA! <BR><BR><B>Playability:</B><BR>Sam\'s move set gets a lot of mileage out of the GBA\'s small button selection <BR><BR><B>Entertainment:</B><BR>Alternately engaging and supremely frustrating, Pandora Tomorrow is a fun, yet mixed experience <BR><BR><B>Replay:</B><BR>Low <BR><BR>Rated: <B>8 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Jeremy Zoss</B><BR>Issue: <B>May 2004</B><BR><BR><B>2nd Opinion:</B><BR> I wouldn\'t want to be in Sam Fisher\'s shoes. ""Don\'t kill this guy. No alarms."" Too much structure in his world. Similarly, the title\'s exacting stealth operations weren\'t that exciting &#8211; even if the gameplay capabilities of this pint-sized agent (like being able to pick locks, move bodies, and flatten along walls) were cool. Without the amazing light and shadow effects of the console, this side-scroller leaves you with an unsophisticated stealth experience &#8211; which is just inherent in 2D, handheld gameplay. The combat was also basic. I\'ll leave the NSA dirty business to Sam Fisher, while I search for more patently exciting fare. <BR><BR>Rated: <B>7 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Matthew Kato</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Lau is able to fight multiple enemies while running, gliding, floating, and running on walls. To make the action even more authentic, all of the characters in <i>Bujingai: The Forsaken City</i> have fluid motion capture movements that give them just as much personality as Lau.']","by

But watch out for the many obstacles and traps you'll encounter as you play."", '', 'Ribbit King, a truly twisted title that creates a new sport called Frolf (which is, basically, golfing with frogs instead of balls), is yet another game aimed at hardcore devotees of Japanese whimsy. You know who you are: You\'ve beaten Rez 18 times. You\'ve written your own arrangements of the music in Gitaroo-Man for string quartet and woodwinds.

[cue tears and sappy music]', 'The rest of you might want to consider the decision to buy Ribbit King a little more carefully. While the basic mechanics are that of a simplified golf game (with a rudimentary two-click swing), the real meat of the Ribbit King experience comes from exploring the strange ""gimmicks"" strewn throughout each course. These include spiderwebs that can bounce your frog further distances, giant snakes that shake you in their jaws until you jiggle the analog stick to break free, or even conveyor belts that take frogs to otherwise inaccessible platforms. Much of your score depends on mastering these gimmick combos, which earn you big points (often more than getting the frog in the hole). This makes for an odd brand of play, but often the gimmicks are too random in effect to really allow for strategy. Many times, you\'ll hit what looks like a bum shot, only to be whisked through an unforeseen sequence of gimmicks that place you right up to the hole. While it\'s certainly amusing, after a time the heavy reliance on gimmicks felt, well, kind of gimmicky.', 'After the novelty is gone, it\'s an adequate, if goofy, golf title with passable technical execution. The camera system and graphics engine certainly won\'t win any awards (there are definitely times when the poor camera and overhead view make it difficult to aim especially on the futuristic levels), but I guess that\'s not really the point. All in all, this feels like a stand-alone game that would have done better as a cool Mario Golf minigame mode.<br /><br /><b>Concept:</b><br />Frolf: where sport and amphibious life meet! <br /><br /><b>Graphics:</b><br />A charming art style makes the ho-hum graphics somewhat irrelevant <br /><br /><b>Sound:</b><br />Yippie-skippy-synthy-plinky-Casio-doo-de-dah <br /><br /><b>Playability:</b><br />I think a three-click swing would have made this a little more interesting, but it\'s solid overall <br /><br /><b>Entertainment:</b><br />Japanophiles, cute-fetishists: Reserve your copy now. Everybody else: Rent it <br /><br /><b>Replay:</b><br />Moderate <br /><br />Rated: <b>7 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Matt Helgeson</b><br />Issue: <b>June 2004</b><br /><br /><b>2nd Opinion:</b><br /> As much as I dug this goofy little game, it\'s certainly not going to appeal to a wide audience. It\'s too basic and odd to strike a chord with mainstream gamers. But those who like their games heavy on Japanese flavor will definitely be pleased with this strange golf title. It looks a little bit sharper on the GameCube than on the PS2, but it\'s a bizarrely fun time on either system, and the unlockable cartoons on the bonus disc are a hoot. Yep, it\'s definitely as odd as it sounds, but if that\'s your thing (I know it\'s mine), then you\'ll have a blast with this title.<br /><br />Rated: <b>7.5 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Jeremy Zoss</b><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0"" /></a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

They are at odds with a rogue group of warriors known as the Aoto gang. Like the magistrate office, this group had long represented values of loyalty and chivalry, but the death of their former leader left them vulnerable. Several would-be successors began claiming rights to leadership and the gang soon transformed into an uncontrollable group of arrogant and violent vigilantes that terrorize the defenseless citizens of Amahara.', '<i>Way of the Samurai</i> was marked by its open-ended gameplay and the sequel not only continues this formula but expands upon it.

It has  unprecedented, incredibly authentic football gaming with realism you have to see to believe.   Go online and take on the best Madden players in quick tournaments, or compete in a mini-game of Rushing Attack', 'Force the action on defense in <i>Madden NFL 2005</i>. New defensive tools allow you to make more plays and be in on all of the action. The all-new Hit Stick lets you lay the big hit to turn the momentum of the game in your favor. With the new Storyline Central, you get the inside scoop around the league from radio host Tony Bruno, along with local and national newspapers, to help you make critical franchise decisions. With groundbreaking graphics that capture the real stadium experience, Madden NFL 2005 continues its 15-year tradition of innovation in video game football.', '<b>Key Features:</b>', ""The newspapers in Storyline Central work just like the papers you read at home on Sunday morning. Every team in Franchise Mode has a newspaper from their local city that discusses only the stories that pertain to that team. In addition to the local papers there's USA Today, the national paper featuring the most important stories from across the entire NFL. Every week, you'll see articles about the game you just played, your upcoming game, injuries, playing times, your rankings on offense and defense, etc -- practically everything that happens in Franchise Mode can and will show up in the newspapers."", 'The second part of Storyline Central is the Tony Bruno Show on EA Sports Radio. Each week, host Tony Bruno breaks down the biggest stories in the NFL on talk radio. The show feels just like a real sports radio show, featuring callers, player and coach interviews, trivia questions, and the occasional rant from Tony himself. There are 15 NFL coaches and over 60 different fans that call in, and the show is driven by events in Franchise Mode, so every team is mentioned based on the magnitude of the events happening to them.', ""The third aspect is email. Each week, you'll receive emails about everything going on with your team -- email from players, coaches, general managers, the PR department, you name it. If a player is upset about his playing time, you're definitely going to hear about it. In addition to sending and receiving email, you can do a multitude of day-to-day tasks from the email screen. Depending on what's happening to your team at the time, you can use the email screen to check your gameplan, make changes in your depth chart, read last week's box score, or place an injured player on IR."", ""But along with all the good comes a little bad -- player personalities. In the past, owners could have two or three Pro Bowl caliber players at the same position and never use those players. So to make it even more realistic, the game is now set it up so that every player, relative to their talent and age, will expect a certain amount of playing time. If you have two amazing quarterbacks and one of them sits on the bench all year long, he'll start to get very angry, and you'll definitely hear about it. But just like in the NFL, winning cures everything. If you have a team full of angry players, make a Super Bowl run -- that should make the atmosphere in the locker room a little more positive."", ""And finally, there's the new trade/free agency system. Trades are more realistic than ever before because we've added trades during the draft in the off-season. As was evident in April's draft, the majority of NFL trades happen during the first few rounds of the draft every year. Additionally, our off-season free agency system has been completely re-worked this year to make more like the real NFL, where free agents choose where they want to play based on salary and a number of other different factors. You'll see older players sign with teams who have a shot to make it to the Super Bowl, and you'll see younger players lean toward playing in large markets for the marketing exposure. Prestige is also a big factor in every player's decision. Prestige is affected by how you run your organization and how you treat your players. If you are always cutting players or putting them on the trading block, the rest of the players around the league won't feel comfortable playing for you."", 'When it comes right down to it, Storyline Central is the most in-depth feature ever done in <i>Madden NFL Football</i> (or any other game for that matter) and represents the real NFL like never before.']",Electronic Arts,"['>#38,205 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#3,062 in Video Games &gt; PC Games &gt; PC Games']",,Video Games,B0001Y8UK2

The VEG can be used with a spare stand-alone monitor, or it can share the VGA monitor that is currently connected to your PC. Connect your gaming console to the VEG and see your games as you've never seen them before, in incredible clarity at up to 1024 x 768 resolution! Connect an TV antenna or cable TV feed and you'll marvel at the crispness of the image presented. The included full-function remote control will have you channel surfing in no time.  When used with the monitor connected to your PC, the VEG makes it simple to switch back and forth between PC use and TV or gaming use. A quick push of a button on the included remote control tells the VEG which output to display. The VEG can even switch the sound going to your PC's speakers as well, letting you switch between fragging away on your PC to gaming on your PS2 with ease.  Using your connected gaming console as a DVD player? Maybe you should be. The VEG uses 3:2 pull down correction that eliminates jitter from DVD movies that occurs during the transfer from film.

Roughly following the movie plot, Rodney is a young inventor who moves to the big city in pursuit of an inventing job with the famous inventor Bigweld. He\'s rebuffed, and discovers a plot to get rid of the older robots, called ""outmodes."" As Rodney, the single player gathers bolts and blueprints for his inventions, including Wonderbot, and fights unfriendly robots by clubbing them with his wrench or blasting them with scrap metal. Collecting the blueprints and other items are usually the key to finishing a level, and sometimes you just have to try any random action to find them (you\'re strongly recommended to upgrade to the object finder). Occasionally you\'ll run into other characters like Lug, Cappy, Tupper, and Aunt Fanny, but it\'s Rodney\'s show, constantly accompanied and occasionally assisted by Wonderbot. There\'s also a dizzying arcade-like race in the transport pod (the DVD includes a one- to four-player head-to-head race version). The game feels a lot like Wallace and Gromit in <i>Project Zoo</i>. Both games offer a marvelous 3-D environment with a real sense of height and space, collecting bolts for inventions is a central goal, and both overrely on timed jumping, which can be a problem when the camera perspective shifts. (The camera angle in <i>Robots</i> is a little easier to control, however.) The sound-alike voice actors are solid, and you can unlock video clips and other bonuses. All in all, it\'s a fairly safe and fun game for kids to play or watch, and if one of your measuring sticks of a game is not being able to beat it in a day or two, <i>Robots</i> is long enough to offer a good deal of playing time. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>', '<b>Pros:</b>', '<b>Cons</b>', '']","by

Between 2000 and 2020, a series of wars turned our world into a nuclear wasteland. Humans have since rebuilt, but old tensions and hatreds resurfaced and the fighting began again. What's left of the Japanese government decides that for the good of the world, they'll take out ALL the warring factions. Blaze a trail for peace, as Japan's premier combat pilot!"", '', ""I play a lot of mech games. I like the more strategy-based offerings just as much as the titles that are all about an enjoyable mindless scrap. Allied Strike purports to be both, but isn't really either. Instead, it feels like a war machine that is too far behind the times, and it gets blown away by its competitors before it can even begin the battle."", ""The first feature that will strike you as off-kilter about Gungriffon is the visuals. There's a vague sort of blur about them that makes it seem like you're looking through a mesh screen. Everything looks flat and colorless. The next thing you'll discover is that you don't know what the heck you're doing. There's no semblance of a tutorial to give you any guidance, so you're left to learn the controls on your own. Without any story introduction and very little in-game dialogue, you're left to wonder why you're fighting and whom you're fighting against. There are a bevy of weapons, mechs, and other customizations to explore, but it's never clear what should work best in any given situation. Consequently, your first hours with the game end up being a guess and check period filled with much cursing, foot stomping, and gnashing of teeth."", ""I have to admit to being a fan of switching between first- <br />and third-person views on the fly. I also appreciated that the enemy AI seemed intelligent enough to try and flank me from time to time, but my ally AI would often dive in way over its head and get destroyed quickly, which was annoying. Online multiplayer is a worthwhile addition to the series, and I was glad to see it present. If enough people end up playing, there could be some rewarding strategy/action gaming to be found.

Sure, you\'ll probably spend most of the night hunched over a toilet, but at least you won\'t have the misery that this game delivers etched in your mind for all of eternity.

Once a fish starts biting, the fight begins. Following the on-screen visual cues, players must carefully balance reeling in the fish while keeping an eye on the line\'s tension so it doesn\'t break. Button combinations can also be used to weaken the fish\'s resolve, allowing for an easier catch. As players progress, additional rods, lures, and live bait become available to improve the odds of landing the ""big one."" Other play options include an Open Fishing mode and a Quick Challenge.

Scarcer still were any sources of water. The creatures of Athas were twisted by the free use of magic. They constantly adapted to the harsh conditions. New monsters emerged from the deep desert to plague the remnants of man. Now the only stable concentrations of humanity are in tightly controlled city-states. Without exception, these are ruled by vicious sorcerer-kings - the last remnants of the wizards who depleted Athas. These kings call themselves gods and rule through a religious organization known as the templars. Their rule is uniformly harsh and capricious, and a large proportion of the populace is enslaved. Only the strongest can feel any measure of safety because the templars can condemn anyone without a trial. The few places with any freedom are isolated villages founded by escaped slaves. Though free, life in the wastelands is precarious. Water supplies can fail, marauding monsters can devastate a village, and slavers are a constant threat. Until these tiny villages can look beyond day-to-day survival and ally with one another, they are unlikely to survive more than a few years.

The reason: this was the year that many pivotal battles were fought including Midway, Stalingrad, N. Africa, and... Guadalcanal. This game deals with the desperate battles fought in the Solomon Islands, specifically in and around the island of Guadalcanal, in which the Allies tried to stop the Japanese from their drive to Australia. In TF42, you can play as either the Americans or Japanese. All the major ships that participated are represented, including the infamous Yamato and devastating Iowa. It features individual historical battles, as well as the whole Guadalcanal Campaign. The objective in the Campaign is to take over both bases on Guadalcanal, but as you are the Naval commander, you do not have direct control over the land battle. Your main objective is to keep the marines on Guadalcanal supplied and bring reinforcements to them, to shell the enemy base, and to stop the enemy from bringing supplies and reinforcements to their troops. These 3 tasks are accomplished by assigning the ships available to you into Task Forces and Task Groups, and send them on Patrol, Supply, and Bombard missions. More ships become available as time progresses. The game has a strategic mode in which you can order your fleets around and monitor the overall situation, and a tactical mode in which two fleets meet and you can actually command the battle in real-time and ""jump into"" any ship and fire the guns or torpedos. You also have air support. The planes can patrol or, if you have fighters/dive bombers/torp bombers available, attack enemy fleets!

In the beginning before the age of man the heavenly realms saw a great rebellion. Lucifer, filled with pride and thirsting for power, dared to set himself against the Almighty. He was defeated and cast out of Heaven to rule his fallen domain until the Tribulation and the Final Battle. At this fateful moment, you are an immortal angel faced with an eternal choice - choose the Divine Path of Obediance and remain faithful to the Most High God, or choose the Fallen Path of Power and follow Lucifer in a daring bid to break the gates of Heaven. Choose well, for your decision carries eternal consequences. THE WAR IN HEAVEN is a 3D action game that combines fast-paced combat action with uncompromising Christian values. Designed and produced by two professional game developers who openly acknowledge Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, The War In Heaven was created to provide an exciting alternative to the spiritually dark and blood-drenched games that are so popular today among teenage and adult gamers. Personal choice is the defining feature of the game. Set at the time of Lucifer's rebellion against God, the player takes the role of an angel and decides whether to obediently serve the Almighty as one of the Divine Host, or to join the rebellion and fight in the legions of the Fallen. Each of THE WAR IN HEAVEN's twelve levels incorporates a distinct Biblical lesson relating to the consequences of following the Divine path of Obedience or the Fallen path of Knowledge. Important spiritual truths such as Fear Of The Lord and Righteousness are revealed in between furious battles with the angels of the opposing side.""]",Valuesoft,"['>#66,833 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#7,393 in Video Games &gt; PC Games &gt; PC Games']",,Video Games,B0002O38OE

The most notable change is the map system, which allows the player to have more control of how much experience the team gets and thus how they level-up.

In between, you can roam around and solve simple street crimes (mugging, car jackings, etc), or earn upgrades for your driving, shooting, and fighting abilities. The upgrade mechanism is important because while it\'s an entertaining way to add new gameplay elements several hours in, the early game leaves you with so few moves that the game is hard, or worse, boring.
