Today's players have three dominant platforms to choose from: Nintendo Wii, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 by Microsoft. Each is an impressive multifunctional device, with designs meant to encourage integration into existing home entertainment systems and networks, but each goes about this in different ways. Taking a few minutes to examine the main features, and getting more familiar with available options, accessories and possible limitations of each console is the optimal way to determine which is the best choice for the players in a household.\n\nMotion Gaming\n\nAlthough motion gaming has been front and center since the launch of the Wii in 2006, the other two consoles have their own motion gaming offerings that provide unique play opportunities on their respective platforms that have also found a wide audience. See a breakdown of the motion gaming capacity of each of the systems below.\n\nWii Remote Plus and Nunchuk\n\nThe Wii Remote Plus controller is the standard wireless controller that ships with each Wii. It combines the intuitive motion controls of the original Wii Remote with the precision technology of the Wii MotionPlus accessory, all built-in to a single unit. The device is handled in a wand-like fashion, and uses internal gyroscope and accelerometer technology to pinpoint the players movements and physical positioning which it then relates into a game via a sensor bar connected to the console. The Wii Remote Plus has only a few buttons making it easy to use. It also contains a speaker, a rumble feature, and an external connector for other input devices like the Nunchuk controller and the Classic Controller.""]","by

Focused on historically based, intense, small-scale WWII combat rather than the mega battles set in sci-fi or fantasy game worlds that are common to most RTS games, this allows players to experience both the fruits and follies of their battlefield decisions on an intimate level as they truly become part of the story. This approach to storytelling is taken even further in three separate single player campaigns built into Tales of Valor. Set during the historical battles following the Allied invasion of Europe on D-Day, these three -- Tiger Ace, Causeway and Falaise Pocket -- illustrate the struggles of both individual German and Allied squads from both the perspective of tank commanders and crew and field soldiers. Each campaign contains three missions, allowing players to immerse themselves in the gameplay and get to know their squadmates."", ""<b>New Multiplayer Vehicles and Modes</b></br>In addition to its single player campaigns, <i>Company of Heroes</i> also features significant new multiplayer functionality.

These include, but are not limited to, the 'Schwimmwagon' an German amphibious vehicle used for reconnaissance missions and enemy troop harassment; the Hellcat, a sturdy Allied plane valuable in battling tanks from above; and the Kangaroo, a heavily armored, British troop carrier. The game also contains three new multiplayer modes which utilize both Allied and Axis forces. 'Stonewall' mode is a co-op mode where players work together to fend off invasion as they struggle to keep a town from falling under enemy control. 'Assault' mode challenges players to push the limits of the front line as they choose a unit, battle opposing enemy units and attempt to destroy the opposition's headquarters. And finally, 'Panzerkrieg' is an all out arcade style tank battle where every unit is out for itself."", ""<b>Direct Fire Control</b></br>As an extension of <i>Company of Heroes'</i> focus on small-scale, but intense combat, <i>Tales of Valor</i> features a new optional targeting system known as 'Direct Fire.' Through this players can target exact spots on tanks or other vehicles, specific areas of the battlefield or even individual soldiers within a unit. This ultra specific targeting system allows players to get even closer to the action than in previous games, yet is toggle based, making it is easy for players to return to standard firing as you choose.

In <em>Mount & Blade: Warband</em>, you lead your men into battle, expand your realm within the land of Calradia. Calradia is a land at war, a land offering great riches and even greater dangers to the adventurers and mercenaries that flock to shed their blood on its soil. With unerring courage and a strong sword, a warrior can make a name as for himself here and more. Raise a band of hardened soldiers, become the lord of several towns and castles, and perhaps one day you may wield the power to depose kings and perhaps take their thrones for yourself.', ""<strong>Gameplay</strong><br /> <em>Mount & Blade: Warband</em> is an action RPG that utilizes medieval weapons, units, combat techniques&#x2014;especially cavalry&#x2014;and strategy exclusively. It does not feature magic. It is a standalone expansion of the original game's universe and play mechanics, meaning that the original <em>Mount & Blade</em> game is not necessary for play. In single player mode players create a character, align themselves with one of the five fictional, yet historically realistic, factions existing in the gameworld and set off to carve out a realm for themselves is the kingdom of Calradia. Along the way they will meet units of other factions on the field of battle and with continued success against them gain experience and level up their character, and units. Along with being able to control their character, players are able to command and control their units in a real-time strategy (RTS) like capacity. Unlike the original game, in <em>Warband</em> players are afforded more diplomatic tools and strategies&#x2014;such as political marriages&#x2014;which can ultimately allow them to move beyond simply overthrowing a monarch, instead allowing them to take the throne themselves and even install vassals."", ""<strong>Multiplayer Options</strong><br /> Again, setting itself apart from the original single player game, <em>Mount & Blade: Warband</em> allows for a wide variety of online multiplayer scenarios. These range from near massive multiplayer online conflicts that support up to 64 players, to more organized smaller skirmishes. Modes available online include: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Conquest, Battle, and Siege. Within select online multiplayer modes units can be commanded in the RTS fashion available in single player. In this players take control of a set number of bot units in all out competition against all other players, or gather their controlled units together within a single faction splitting battlefield responsibilities in their fight against others. In this, <em>Mount & Blade: Warband</em> allows players to unleash both their individual character's skill at arms, as well as their overall ability to strategize on the battlefield in live play."", '<strong>Key Game Features</strong>', '<b>Requires <i>Steam</i> account to activate.</b></div><br /><div><table><tr><th style=""text-align:left;"" colspan=""2""><b>System Requirements:</b></th></tr><tr><td>Supported OS:&#xa0;&#xa0;</td><td>Windows</td></tr><tr><td>Processor:&#xa0;&#xa0;</td><td>none specified</td></tr><tr><td>RAM:&#xa0;&#xa0;</td><td>none specified</td></tr><tr><td>Hard Disk:&#xa0;&#xa0;</td><td>none specified</td></tr><tr><td>Video Card:&#xa0;&#xa0;</td><td>none specified</td></tr></table></div>']","by
