He can then bounce the bubble on his head. Every time he bounces the bubble, the bubble grows and changes color. The bubble can then be popped, depending upon the bubble&apos;s size and color, different types of sports balls will fly out of the bubble destroying enemies touched by the balls. For example, a purple bubble will release a baseball and the largest orange bubble will release several basketballs. If an enemy is touched by a bubble, he will simply be stunned and unable to move for a moment. The first time a bubble is thrown, it is purple. If it is popped, a baseball comes out and can only hit one enemy at a time. If a purple bubble is bounced on Spanky&apos;s head, it turns green. When the green bubble is popped, it creates a string of soccer balls that can usually take out a line of enemies. Bouncing the green bubble creates a yellow bubble that, when popped, becomes a gyrating volleyball, causing damage to an area of increasing radius. Bouncing the bubble a fourth and last time, the largest bubble is reached. When this orange bubble is popped, it releases several basketballs that shower down on a wide range of enemies. Each further bounce does nothing to the bubble; it remains orange. There are a total of five worlds with ten levels each. After clearing each world&apos;s ten levels, the player must face a main boss. After defeating all five bosses, the player fights the witch herself. In the SNES version, levels are cleared when the required number of keys unlocks a door; in the GB version, levels are cleared when all the enemies have been destroyed.

Depending on whether the actions you perform are good or bad, how those around you relate to you will gradually shift, which is especially significant where the members of your party are concerned. There is even an influence system similar to the one in <i>Knights of the Old Republic 2</i> that allows you to gradually redeem, or corrupt, your party members through your actions. Design the character you want and choose your alignment, your allies, your companions, and how you want your character to develop, and then carry the battle to your enemies.

You can move buildings, alter terrain, script encounters, write dialogues, or create quests and items in order to create an epic adventure for you, or any other worldbuilder, to use.

As a player, you\'ll be involved in virtually every aspect of the conflict between the Rebels and the Empire. You must simultaneously manage your economy, develop technology, build factories, planetary defenses, ships, and space stations, as well as get information on new planets and maneuver your various forces around the galaxy. Unlike some strategy games that are decided by who has hoarded enough resources to overwhelm the enemy, it is just as important to build your forces up in an intelligent fashion in order to take over the galaxy. And to ensure that you\'re never allowed to sit back and relax, everything all happens in real time, so if you spend too long considering what to build or where to send your fleet, you\'ll be inviting a massive, debilitating attack from the computer.', ""<i>Star Wars: Empire at War</i> has a huge number of variables you'll need to consider. Many planets have unique bonuses, such as allowing certain units to be created more powerfully or cheaply, thereby increasing your credit income by different degrees, as well as only allowing the largest ships like Mon Calamari cruisers and Imperial Star Destroyers to be built on certain planets. And the Empire and Rebels obviously both have their differences. The Empire usually generates a lot more money, which it can use to eventually overwhelm the rebel forces if left unchecked, but it has to find them first by sending out probe droids to seek out their forces. The Rebels, on the other hand, have far fewer resources, which can make them more difficult to play and learn, but they can steal technology and sneak raiding parties past many of the Empire's space defenses. And each of the two sides has their own distinct Hero units, which can be extremely powerful and can sway the course of battle greatly. You can use Palpatine or Mon Mothma to reduce a planet's production costs; C3PO and R2D2 to steal technology or hack into an enemy's turrets and turn them against their own troops; Darth Vader to force-push entire groups of enemy soldiers on land; or Boba Fett to crush concentrations of fighters by dropping seismic charges in space. To balance out these massive powers, both sides can hire generic bounty hunters to try and eliminate a rival hero from the game."", ""While the land battles in <i>Star Wars: Empire at War</i> are highly enjoyable and extremely challenging, involving heavily armored AT-ATs and more, the space battles are truly breathtaking. Seeing a Star Destroyer crawling with bright-blue ion energy, watching an entire wave of X-wings explode into flame, or witnessing a fully-armed and operational Death Star blow a planet to smithereens are unparalleled experiences in this galaxy or any other. And the visual and sound effects aren't the only thing that will amaze you during a space battle. The bigger units like space stations and Star Destroyers all have hard points pertaining to different systems. You can target these different systems to cripple ships in different ways, taking out their shield generator, weapons system, or engines to reduce their effectiveness, or taking out the hanger on Imperial capital ships to thin out their fighter cover. And as you destroy a cannon or shield generator, that piece will break off and float away, and while most ships eventually explode, the Mon Calamari Cruisers and Imperial Star Destroyers will actually tear in to pieces that continue to linger throughout the battle. What's more, you always need to watch out for ships the AI (artificial intelligence) might be hiding in asteroid belts, waiting to spring them on the flanks of your fleet at the worst possible moment."", ""The strategic layer of <i>Empire at War</i> takes place on a two-dimensional galactic map showing you all the planets. In the full campaign mode, you must consider and plan around more than 40 such planets, whereas in some of the simpler conquest scenarios, you may end up dealing with as few as eight or 10 of them. Instead of playing in the campaign mode, you can play multiplayer matches over a LAN or online with up to eight players. The LucasArts' matchmaking system makes finding an opponent easy, and if you are playing a head-to-head match against a friend, you have the ability to save a match and reload it to continue at a later time. Delivering a presentation that is as epic as the films themselves, <i>Star Wars: Empire at War</i> is ideal for any fan of strategy games, and absolutely necessary for <i>Star Wars</i> aficionados.<P> This Collector's Edition is also packed with bonuses, including five new playable Skirmish maps that span the galaxy from the shipyards of Kuat, to land and space battles on Ryloth and Polus. You also get exclusive concept art that illustrates the evolution of the game's look, and two screensavers that celebrate the <i>Star Wars</i> universe with X-wings, TIE fighters, and a demonstration of the Empire's ultimate weapon -- the Death Star. Plus the Collector's Edition ships with four wallpaper images and a 3D lenticular package.""]","by

It would take a miracle for one man to fulfill this legend and turn divided Mongolia into an empire stretching from China to Europe. Genghis Khan was determined to supply this miracle. As Genghis Khan, Richard the Lion-Hearted, Emperor Alexious III or Shogun Minamoto of Japan you build an empire. Keep it by making sure your populace is happy, your treasury full, your subordinates loyal, and your enemies down. In battle, out-maneuver your opponent with cavalry, lay siege to his castle with archers, or even challenge him to a duel. Battlefield victory aloe does not mean conquest. The newly acquired country must be governed, prisoners dealt with and a successor found. A successful rendezvous with a local princess may help solve the last of these problems. GENGHIS KHAN is a sophisticated simulation for one to four players. Although a great war game, the human side of empire-building has not been forgotten. Finding the right way to approach a hostile empress is just as important as training troops for battle. Know the people around you and use them effectively. In a world where empires rise an fall with the seasons do not let your guard down and be ready for a host of problems, natural and otherwise.']","by

Squad Battles : Tour of Duty,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games']",{},"['Tour of Duty is the second game in the Squad Battles Series and continues from the original game Squad Battles Vietnam. In addition to over 40 scenarios, Tour of Duty has a Campaign Game, the first in the Squad Battles series to do so, which enables the player to assume the role of a leader and fight multiple battles over the course of a year in Vietnam. There are 5 campaigns, including American Army, Marine, Air Cavalry, Army Riverine, and Australian forces. Although it uses a common game engine, Tour of Duty is a complete game and independent of Squad Battles Vietnam. Either can be installed and played without the other. However, PBEM and network games require that both players have the same game being played, Vietnam or Tour of Duty, and scenario and battles are not interchangeable between the games. Tour of Duty contains multiple enhancements to the Squad Battles game engine including Caves and Tunnels, Smoke and Illumination, and several enhancements and new features not found in the original Squad Battles Vietnam. Tour of Duty includes American Army, American Marine, South Vietnamese, South Korean, Australian, North Vietnamese, and Viet Cong forces and equipment. Scenarios cover a wide variety of situations many of which include air and armored cavalry. Tour of Duty supports single person play against the computer, two-person hot-seat, two-person Play-By-E-Mail, and multiplayer network play over LANs and the Internet. Comes with Main Program, full-featured Scenario Editor, and Order of Battle Editor.

You are now an A.P.A. member -- your job is to find and shoot down the pirates, to secure the open sky.""]","by

It is based on Taito\'s popular 1986 arcade game Bubble Bobble, featuring characters and themes from that game. Its characteristically cute Japanese animation and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home gaming systems. At the start of each round, the rectangular playing arena contains a prearranged pattern of coloured ""bubbles"". (These are actually referred to in the translation as ""balls""; however, they were clearly intended to be bubbles, since they pop, and are taken from Bubble Bobble.) At the bottom of the screen, the player controls a device called a ""pointer"", which aims and fires bubbles up the screen. The colour of bubbles fired is randomly generated and chosen from the colors of bubbles still left on the screen. The closer the bubbles get to the bottom of the screen, the faster the music plays and if they cross the line at the bottom then the game is over. The objective of the game is to clear all the bubbles from the arena without any bubble crossing the bottom line. Bubbles will fire automatically if the player remains idle. After clearing the arena, the next round begins with a new pattern of bubbles to clear.

But the World Cup mode is where most people start, and although its default settings have you assume control of one of the 32 teams that qualified for the finals, it also includes the 95 other teams that didn\'t make the final cut. You can now begin in the qualifying rounds in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, Africa and Oceania, or jump straight to the final 32 teams using real or randomly generated group information. If you are a veteran soccer player looking for a truly punishing challenge, the unlockable Perfect difficulty level will give you the game of your life.', ""The player animations in <i>2006 FIFA World Cup</i> are excellent, and the controls are fully customizable. Although every player on the pitch has a handful of skill moves at his disposal, you'll find that good use of the intuitive first-touch controls, along with passes, through balls, and dummies, are your most reliable means of besting your opponents. The most notable improvements in this version of World Cup soccer are its new star players feature, the new shooting mechanism, and the penalty shootout. <P> Denoted by a star above their heads, there are two dozen unlockable players that can be inserted onto the bench of their respective national teams and can take over the game in a variety of ways. There are play-making passers like David Beckham, dribblers like Ronaldinho, speedsters like Michael Owen, and shooters like Alessandro Del Piero. Just like in real life, if you are able to play to your stars' strengths, you'll greatly increase your chances of winning. Penalty kicks are also more fun than ever. Opposing goalies can now dance, jump, and move left and right to get into the heads of the penalty kicker. As a kicker, your goal is to hit a small bar on a shot meter, which, if done successfully, allows you to power the ball into the selected corner with ease. However, if you take too long the goalie and the crowd will get to you, forcing the controller to shake and the bar on the shot meter to dance."", ""The overall presentation throughout the World Cup mode, and throughout the entire game, is amazing. Before each match, a camera positioned somewhere in orbit around the Earth zooms in on the appropriate German stadium, and you'll be treated to flybys of the grounds where almost every supporter in the crowd is armed with streamers, confetti, and balloons. You can choose to listen to one of the game's many licensed songs, which come from an eclectic soundtrack spanning 14 countries. Good pre-match commentary replete with World Cup trivia and anecdotes is the icing on the cake, and as your players line up on the pitch before kickoff, you feel the excitement of the moment. The UK announcing duo of Clive Tyldesley and Andy Townsend raise the bar in terms of soccer commentary. Combined with the chants and roar of the crowd, you will find yourself sucked in to a intensely immersive, emotional soccer experience, especially when leading your favorite team in the finals."", ""Another great feature is <i>2006 FIFA World Cup</i>'s global challenge mode, where you are tasked with matching or bettering memorable team performances from World Cup history in 40 different scenarios. For example, you might be required to jump into a game with only 30 minutes remaining and win by the same margin as the real-life victors, simultaneously trying to achieve bonus objectives such as keeping a clean sheet, or not having any players booked. And when you feel like pitting your <i>2006 FIFA World Cup</i> skills against a human opponent instead of the AI, you can play online or to get some friends over for a FIFA Lounge session. Like its predecessor, <i>2006 FIFA World Cup</i> requires you to either pay a small fee, or submit your e-mail address before you can play online."", '<i>2006 FIFA World Cup</i>\'s Lounge mode supports up to eight players, although it can certainly be enjoyed by just two or three. Like the Lounge mode in its earlier iteration, <i>2006 FIFA World Cup</i>\'s Lounge keeps track of your performances against all of the other participants, giving you a different options for determining who gets to play next. The Lounge mode also retains the ""cheap shots"" feature, which lets you level the playing field against opponents by using cheats you\'ve earned during previous performances. As another fun option, the Lounge mode has a new risk-style map feature that allows you to take control of countries on the map by winning games with, or against, them.<P> The closest thing yet to experiencing the excitement and emotion involved in World Cup soccer, and at a fraction of the ticket price, <i>2006 FIFA World Cup</i> is just too good to pass up.']","by

Of course the humans, not having learned their lesson from the previous debacle, wage war against them, defeat them... and then promptly fiddle with their minds, subjugate and exploit any that survived .In 'The City' where everyone lives, there is one human, Professor Azimuth, who has been performing time experiments trying to discover a way to help the poor Boozooks, much to the annoyance of the ruling political BigWig. Everybody knows that Azimuth is doing this, so when he spreads a rumor that a mysterious liberator, the Schnibble, will soon appear, everyone believes that he is creating one. Unfortunately for him and his small son Woodruff, the BigWig also believes it, and takes Azimuth prisoner.

To do this you must complete nine puzzle areas. (There are 3 levels of difficulty, which restore 5%, 10%, or 15% of a section of Dr. Brain\'s brain.) The puzzles are designed to require ""the combined efforts of your seven intelligences,"" as detailed by Dr. Howard Garnder\'s Theory of Multiple Intelligences: verbal/linguistic, logical/mathematical, visual/spatial, bodily/kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, and intra-personal. While one activity requires mainly hand eye coordination, others involve more complex mathematical thinking and problem solving. For instance, players must navigate a three-dimensional maze using a two dimensional map, use a set of basic computer commands to direct a robot around a grid, build a replica of a 3-D block construction using a model which can be rotated, flip the switches on a system of train tracks in order to deliver requested marbles in the correct sequence, and develop a system for filing objects in order to recall which objects were placed where. Other puzzles involve moving letters around a grid to form words, placing and matching pictures of sign language letters in a grid, and rearranging eight bars of music to play a requested song.

Throughout the journey, Anne will be accompanied by the disembodied voice of John Hammond, the founder of Jurassic Park.\n\nTrespasser does not feature some of the typical first-person shooter interface elements. There are no health bars, ammo displays, or power-ups, and players can\'t pick things up just by walking over them. Instead, interaction with the environment is done using Anne\'s arm, which can be moved around using the mouse and which can be used to pick up items, throw rocks, push down crates or wield weapons. Anne\'s voice gives a rough estimate of the amount of ammo left whenever she wield a gun, and Anne has a heart-tattoo that fills with red as she becomes more damaged.\n\nThe game also features a \'realistic\' physics model where every movable object can be knocked over, roll around, or thrown in a manner related to their size and weight. This also means players can crush some of the smaller dinosaurs with heavy crates, and can even use a rock to bash their heads in. The dinosaurs in the game are only trying to survive instead of existing solely for the purpose of killing Anne in wave after wave. Thus they run away when injured and will often attack other dinosaurs rather than the player.']","by

From the fungal rot of the Mushroom Forest to the infernal chemistry of the Mad Hatter's Domain and beyond, Wonderland festers to its core. Undaunted by the diseased ambiance, cavernous confusion and mortal danger that surround her, Alice must undo the chaos.

In Undying, you take on the role of Patrick Galloway and you're drawn into the drama of the Covenants, a dying family whose degeneration threatens the very fabric of reality. A desperate struggle ensues as you must discover the secrets of forgotten magic and use it to counter the destructive forces of chaos and the terror that it has unearthed.

A year later he landed on the southern coast of France, and triumphantly swept to Paris, returning to his position as Emperor with barely a shot being fired. Napoleon\'s Hundred Days had begun. On June 18, 1815, two of the greatest armies in European history faced each other across the terrain near a small Belgian hamlet called Waterloo. Napoleon\'s ""Grand Armee"" had inflicted minor defeats on the Allied forces of Wellington and Blucher at the twin battles of Ligny and Quatres-Bras, but the Prussians had managed to escape largely intact. Could the great military general defy the odds again and produce another stunning victory, or would the Anglo-Allied forces led by Wellington finally end his reign as Emperor of the French?\n\nBattleground 3: Waterloo recreates this pivotal conflict in a traditional turn-based war game format, using hex-grid maps of the battlefield at a scale of 100 meters per hex. Take command of the French army and reverse the historical result, or step into the position of Wellington or Blucher, and see if you can also blunt the genius of Napoleon. Following the style of previous releases in the series, Battleground 3: Waterloo features accurate depictions of all military units, as well as detailed recreations of the battlefield terrain.

To symbolise the unity, the king gave each of his sons a Gem of Tranquility, which when joined conjured a mystical force to protect the land.
