Soldier of Fortune - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>Soldier of Fortune</i> steers the first-person shooter genre away from the supernatural weaponry of <i>Unreal</i> and <i>Quake</i> and toward the realistic tactical combat of <i>Rainbow Six</i> and <i>SWAT 3</i>. In <i>Soldier of Fortune</i>, stealth, caution, and cover carry as much importance as accuracy and firepower.', ""Players assume the role of John Mullins (also the name of the game's real-life mercenary consultant), a soldier for hire who accepts the most dangerous missions the U.S. government offers, including recovering stolen nuclear warheads and infiltrating war-torn Kosovo. Hawk, a burly sidekick voiced by <i>The Green Mile</i> Oscar nominee Michael Clarke Duncan, accompanies Mullins primarily in scripted sequences that advance the grisly story. <i>Solder of Fortune</i>'s single-player story line exceeds genre standards and rivals Valve's classic <i>Half-Life</i> for depth and excitement."", ""A first-person shooter wouldn't be complete without explosive weaponry--<i>Soldier of Fortune</i> certainly doesn't disappoint. The arsenal includes a knife, several pistols, a shotgun, a variety of machine guns, a rocket launcher, flamethrower, sniper rifle, grenades, and a futuristic microwave gun. Unlike most action shooters, players select new weapons before each mission--and you're restricted in how much armament John carries. For instance, you must make tough decisions between the larger weapons. Should you take the submachine gun for close-quarter combat or grab the sniper rifle for a stealthier strategy? Weapons also do much more damage than in typical first-person shooters. If you're unarmored, a single shotgun blast could end your game. These elements give <i>Soldier of Fortune</i> an intensity not often seen in the genre."", ""<i>Soldier of Fortune</i> uses a heavily modified version of id Software's <i>Quake 2</i> 3-D engine, and the results are impressively realistic--perhaps even too realistic. Shoot an enemy in the foot with the pistol, and he'll clutch the wound and favor his good leg. Shoot him in the knee with the shotgun, and the limb will be explosively severed in a spray of gristle. If you're the type of person who thinks most action movies are fakey, you'll appreciate the accurate look, sound, and effect of <i>Soldier of Fortune</i>'s real-world weaponry. But if you're the type of person who closed your eyes during the beach scene in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, you'll want to turn on the password-protected violence lockout option or buy <i>Soldier of Fortune Tactical</i>, which has the lock permanently active. <i>--Doug Radcliffe</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b>', '']","by

When a sudden tsunami shipwrecks the savvy sleuths on an uncharted volcanic island, they need your help to solve a mystery and escape before the volcano blows.', 'Our just-graduated fifth grade testers found this new ClueFinder program challenging but doable, and boy, did they enjoy it. The adventure begins with the ClueFinder kids shipwrecked on a mysterious island. Two of their teammates are trapped in an underground hideaway, and the ship\'s captain and crew are missing as well. It\'s up to the rest of the gang to find their friends and get off the island- all before a monstrous volcano blows its top. To solve the mystery and save the day, kids help the ClueFinders complete activities and collect the strange CrypTiles that will unlock the island\'s secrets. The ten activities cover math, social studies, reading, critical thinking and science. One especially challenging game has players combining fractions with unlike denominators to make whole units. This is done by manipulating tubes of various sizes, a very hands-on method of studying fractions and their relationships. Another strong activity asks kids to read mixed up passages from paragraphs and put them in the right order. There are spelling and vocabulary games, computational activities and map reading exercises. With each successful play, kids are awarded CrypTiles, which they use to get closer to the big rescue. Besides a compelling theme and solid activities, the program has other thoughtful features that kids and grown-ups will appreciate. For instance, before beginning the adventure players can take a brief skills test that sets the activity levels to match kids\' strengths and weaknesses. The program also jumps in with help when children are struggling and keeps records of kids\' progress. There\'s a second CD in the package that lets you print customized skill workbooks.

Myth: The Total Codex - PC/Mac,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Bungie Software shattered real-time strategy norms with its 1997 release, <I>Myth: The Fallen Lords</I>. Eschewing the tried-and-true formula pioneered by such classics as <I>Command & Conquer</I> and <I>WarCraft</I>, <I>Myth</I> broke through the shackles of resource management and unit creation and put strategy and combat at the forefront. In fact, perhaps <I>Myth</I> erected its own genre--the real-time tactical game.', '<I>Myth: The Total Codex</I> combines the original <I>Myth: The Fallen Lords</I> with its sequel, <I>Myth II: Soulblighter</I>, and the expansion pack <I>Myth II: Chimera</I>. Equipped with over 50 single-player levels, dozens of multiplayer maps, and nearly a CD full of user-created levels, maps, and modifications, <I>Myth: The Total Codex</I> is a package that no strategy gamer should pass up.', ""The beauty of <I>Myth</I> lies in the interaction between its well-balanced, fantasy-based units. For example, archers (bowmen in <I>Myth II</I>) can shoot arrows with frightening speed and accuracy, but get pummeled by melee units unless they're protected; dwarves toss devastating bombs, but poor rate of fire and unpredictability sometimes make them a liability; and the powerful Trow Giant can eliminate nearly every unit in a single blow, but is too slow to overcome a force of greater numbers. <I>Myth</I>'s intuitive interface, featuring a rotating camera system, the ability to zoom in and out of battle, plus unit formation and waypoints, allows for precise control of your army."", ""Though its single-player game never ceases to entertain, it's <I>Myth: The Total Codex</I>'s multiplayer game that shines. Players trade for available units (the more powerful the unit, the more expensive it is) and compete on vibrant, varied terrain in games like Last Man on the Hill, King of the Hill, Territories, and Capture the Flag. If you've never experienced Bungie Software's brilliant real-time tactical game, <I>Myth: The Fallen Lords</I> or <I>Myth II: Soulblighter</I>, do yourself a favor and plunge into its fantasy world of strategic combat with the complete compilation, <I>Myth: The Total Codex</I>. --<i>Doug Radcliffe</i>"", ""<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Three full-length single-player campaigns <li>Excellent multiplayer support on Bungie's free online service <li>Intuitive and highly customizable interface <li>Windows and Macintosh versions are included on the same CD </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>If you already have <I>Myth</I> and <I>Myth II,</I> the expansion pack might not justify the price </ul>"", ""It doesn't take much to ruin someone's day in Bungie's newest real-time strategy/tactics game, Myth: The Fallen Lords. For example, an opponent in a network game may spend a good three or four minutes setting up the perfect fir'Bolg archer line along a canyon rim, and along comes a pack of enemy ghols behind the archers. The ghols toss a few pus packets and, after the resulting explosions and paralysis, proceed to make short work of the bowmen. Suddenly, it's a whole different game. That is the essence of Myth - judicious use of the right kind of character to face the enemy and the constant shifting of fortunes as troops skirmish and fall. Oh, and the knowledge of when to stand your ground and when to retreat. Retreating is very important. <P>In single-player Myth, a player controls troops from the armies of light (warriors, archers, berserks, dwarves, and so on), moving them about on the game map and attacking enemies. As a player works through the 24 included scenarios, a storyline about the cycle of darkness and light emerges, with the player striving to set things right through a series of battles. Sounds simple. <P>Well, it's not. Each character type in Myth has its own strengths and weaknesses, and it's important to know those strengths and weaknesses. The player who pits thralls against dwarves probably is going to lose a lot of thralls, whereas the player who pits berserks against the floating soulless will know victory. The landscape in Myth also complicates matters, as the ground is truly three-dimensional. Perch some archers and a couple of dwarves on top of a hill, and those characters will gain a tremendous advantage over an enemy trying to take the hill. Characters also can use the landscape for cover, hiding behind trees to avoid arrows, pus packets, or Molotov cocktails. <P>Control in Myth is easy. Just click on a character (or characters), then click on a spot on the map where the character should end up. To initiate an attack, select a character, then click on the enemy who should be attacked. The battlefield is viewed from an unrestricted camera, which lets you rotate and zoom around the scene of carnage, viewing it from all angles. <P>Myth would be a pretty good game as described, but the folks at Bungie paid special attention to the little things, nudging Myth just a notch higher into its own rarefied category. Soft, subtle sounds immerse you in the Myth world. Arrows clatter when they hit the ground, armor rattles among restless warriors who are standing around, and water splashes as soldiers cross an icy stream. Myth's audio uses stereo panning, making it louder in the right speaker if the sound source is to the right of the camera, or louder in the left speaker if the sound source is to the left of the camera. Myth's physics model is accurate, too. Arrows bounce off shields and trees, blood spatters the landscape, and body parts fly through the air. These items don't disappear, either. The debris of battle builds up on the field. <P>The single-player Myth scenarios are only half of what's great about this game. After all, there's nothing like playing against another human - or humans. Myth includes a network module that lets players compete via an AppleTalk and TCP/IP network. Or gamers can connect to Bungie.net (http://www.bungie.net) and compete against Myth players anywhere. Bungie.net keeps track of players' victories and defeats, and assigns a caste based on these records. Up to 16 players can play in a network game at one time. Teams of players can form orders, and these orders can challenge others to network combat. Even better, players have the opportunity to use units from both the light and dark sides. (There's nothing like the thrill of a trio of trow stomping a foe.) In the first weeks following Myth's release, Bungie's servers have been hit hard, and it's not always easy to connect. Hopefully, access will improve as time goes on. <P>Bungie pushes real-time gaming into a new realm with Myth. The game's amazing rotating 3D camera, the realistic landscape, the gore, the physics, the attention to minute details, and a great network component make Myth one of the most inspired games for the Mac in the past year. We've come to expect nothing less from Bungie, makers of fine titles such as the Marathon series. If you enjoyed games such as Westwood Studios' Command & Conquer and Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft, you will positively love Myth. - David Reynolds <P> <B>Good News:</B> Challenging scenarios. Beautiful 3D graphics viewable from any angle. Realistic physics and gore. Amazing attention to detail. Great network play, even over a modem. <P><B>Bad News:</B> Supports only 3Dfx acceleration.

The game was a huge hit, met with critical acclaim at nearly every turn, and continues to be one of the most popular multiplayer games on the Internet. But thankfully for gamers, Bungie went back to the drawing board to craft a bigger, better Myth. <P> The game takes players to a time 60 years after the events of the original Myth, when peace reigns and the once busy Legion has very little to worry about. But this pleasant state of affairs is about to change. Responding to reports of brigands terrorizing a small village, a small group of warriors stumbles across a much bigger problem: Undead creatures are popping up all over and, even worse, the Fallen Lord named Soulblighter is behind it all. <P> The single-player campaign comprises 25 missions, each of which is remarkably well designed and - on the harder difficulty levels especially - enormously challenging. Scenarios range from simple skirmishes and NPC escorts to the infiltration of a massive keep and even some indoor missions. Fans of the original game\'s Shadow of the Mountain level will love Myth II\'s The Great Library and Redemption levels, along with a number of other great defensive missions. The coolest (and creepiest) level in the game is one in which you must make your way through a haunted dungeon, where friendly and hostile ghosts appear and disappear without warning. <P> Bridge? Keep? Yes, Myth II makes extensive use of large buildings and interactive terrain to liven up the 3D battlefield. During the game, you\'ll run across massive fortifications, destructible bridges, a working drawbridge, a ship, a windmill, and a slew of other eye-popping items. The enhanced 3D engine also supports a number of other new features, colored lighting and shadows, and an underlying terrain mesh that\'s four times finer than the one used by Myth. The result is a smoother-looking game with more realistic settings. <P> Other, more subtle features like the increased ambient life also help to create a more realistic environment. Chickens peck around in the villages, deer bound through the forest, and various birds soar overhead on most maps. Of course, you\'re not limited to looking at these creatures, you can interact with them as well (meaning that you can blow up most of them). The ambient sounds are also enhanced in Myth II. Between the sounds of wildlife in the background and Dwarven bottles exploding, there was never a moment of silence in the game. <P> Although the animated cutscenes in Myth looked good, they were too brief and cryptic to convey much of a story. The Bungie developers must have agreed, because they went out and hired a new animation studio to do the Myth II cinematics. The results are astounding. The cutscenes are still brief, but they look fantastic, and you can always tell what the heck is happening - or at least what is being implied.<P> The AI and pathfinding for all units has been improved, so your troops don\'t mill about endlessly when they can\'t reach their initial destinations. There are some glitches with Myth II\'s pathfinding, such as the ludicrous conga line your warriors form while chasing down an enemy unit, but for the most part, units move and behave much more intelligently than in Myth. <P> Myth II\'s interface and controls are also more intelligent than those we saw in the original Myth. Players who found the keyboard camera controls confusing in Myth can now move and rotate the camera angle simply by moving the mouse. I personally found this more confusing than the old method (which you can still use), but there are undoubtedly some gamers who will welcome the mouse option. A handy control bar now runs alongside the bottom of the screen, providing easy access to commonly used commands and unit formations. Also, you can tell a unit\'s health status simply by passing the mouse over it. Formation facing is much, much simpler than that clunky ""gesture click"" system - you can either turn your troops with the left and right arrow keys, or hold the mouse button to turn your troops at will (an arrow appears on the screen to help you line up the troops properly). <P> For those who found some of the levels in the original game far too difficult, Myth II features a vastly improved set of difficulty levels. These are well stepped and let gamers of any talent and interest level jump in and enjoy the world of Myth II. Kudos to Bungie for making the game so approachable for novice players without sacrificing the challenge hard-core gamers crave (and those higher difficulty settings can be pretty damn hard). <P> Hard-core Myth fans will also appreciate the improved multiplayer support in Myth II. The game offers a ton of new multiplayer features (such as player alliances) and scenarios (several of which involve the aforementioned ambient life in strange and unusual roles). Bungie.net has also been updated, and the performance of games over Bungie\'s free service seems faster and more reliable in general. <P> Rounding out this epic game are two of the tools Bungie used to create the game. Fear and Loathing are powerful editors that players can use to craft their own missions and maps. Though you\'ll need some practice to master these complex utilities, they can be used to create and modify Myth II levels in just about any way imaginable. These tools should certainly prove popular to the thousands of devoted Bungie.net users, as the service lets players easily exchange custom maps. <P>Bungie basically improved all the good features in Myth; added a number of gameplay, multiplayer, and graphical enhancements; and then threw in some slick and powerful editing tools to boot. The end result is one of the best games to be released this year, and one that should easily find a home in any serious gamer\'s library. <i>--Michael E.

Owners of the Game Boy printer can print their prize collections and mount their characters on the wall, if they so desire. Unfortunately, the monsters collected in <i>Pokmon Pinball</i> cannot be traded with other Pokmon monsters from the Red, Blue, or Yellow games, making this game a stand-alone product.

Tiny Tank,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['When I say ""cute,"" what\'s the first thing that pops into your head? Bunny rabbits? Babies, perhaps? <P>But tanks? In the cute rankings, they probably fall somewhere between snakes and extremely hairy guys. Nevertheless, one tank is making a bid to move up the list by starring in its own video game: Tiny Tank. This 3D action title offers interesting - but not glitch-free - gameplay and a humorous storyline some people will embrace with affection... and others will reject as cheesy. <P>In a plot eerily similar to the Terminator movies, an army of robots has rebelled against humans in their mission to take over the world. However, the role of Arnold Schwarzenegger as robot-savior has been taken over by a potty-mouthed yellow tank. One hundred years later, this tank has been brought back to life to traverse twelve multiple-mission-based levels, each usually ending with a boss that must be destroyed. There\'s also a two-player versus mode, but it\'s the one-player game that contains this title\'s meat and potatoes. <P>Tiny Tank has a turret that automatically targets enemies, and four weapon pods (two in front, two in the rear) that can be upgraded. Most enemies can be killed with well-aimed blasts - although for a few you\'ll need to use ""alternative"" strategies, such as avoiding detection or tricking them into killing each other. The level designs are well crafted, with a few hidden nooks and power-ups to make free exploration worthwhile. <P>Underneath Tiny Tank\'s kill-anything-that-shoots mentality is some surprisingly deep gameplay, which winds up being this title\'s strongest point. While you play, the tank collects ""brains"" (the heads of destroyed computer enemies) and weapons. The tank can configure its weapon locations, then use the brains to make them target more effectively. This feature isn\'t too vital in early levels, but it becomes a necessity later on. Another gameplay plus are miniature tanks that can be programmed to shoot at enemies or gather power-ups. It\'s a surprisingly cool aspect of the game, as the pee-wee tanks can visit areas Tiny Tank can\'t reach. Both these gameplay twists make this game more than just a mindless shooter, and more satisfying as a result. <P>Still, the game has a few kinks to work out, especially in the camera and control departments. Jumping seems a major pain, since the tank tends to slide off an edge if it lands too close to it after a jump. It would\'ve been nice if the tank ""stuck"" more to the ground after landing (after all, it is a heavy tank). Furthermore, when Tiny Tank hits sloped surfaces, the camera often wigs out, which makes it difficult to regain one\'s bearings - especially after a jump. This fault seems most frustrating in the heat of battle, when an enemy is in front of the tank but the camera angle prevents it from being seen. <P>Camera glitches aside, the game\'s 3D graphics stand up to the gameplay, with decent explosion effects and rarely any cases of slowdown or pop-up. The game\'s audio gets an above-average grade, mainly because of neat touches such as extra comments when Tiny Tank finds a secret area, kills an enemy, or gets close to death. Some of the in-level soundtracks are unique and cool - in one instance, the music is replaced with an amusing robot radio talk show. <P>It\'s not wholly fair to judge a game\'s merits solely on its storyline and personality, but in Tiny Tank\'s case, it may determine whether folks will find it worth playing all the way through. Some won\'t particularly enjoy Tiny Tank\'s offbeat personality, since it seems the game tries too hard to be funny and cute. Others probably will gravitate toward Tiny Tank\'s persona and soak up the humorous storyline. In any case, the gameplay remains quick and unique regardless of the plot - so it\'s worth finding out if this tiny tank whets your appetite for destruction. --Nelson Taruc <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Tear through 20 hair-raising tracks from Seattle to Tahiti in one of more than 500 incredibly detailed, brand name autos. Then customize your car by purchasing parts with your winnings. Made in USA.', ""Thanks to glowing reviews and a fan base of rabid racing purists, Gran Turismo has built up a reputation as the definitive driving simulation for the PlayStation. While that proved good news for Sony's coffers, it posed a tough challenge for its developers: How can the sequel surpass the original? For better or worse, Gran Turismo 2 has taken the Star Wars: Special Edition approach to tackling this challenge. The bulk of the game's top-notch graphics and gameplay remain true to the original, but this version is packed with extra add-ons - more tracks, more cars, more races and more secrets - that have turned the game into a mammoth two-disc experience. The sequel may not play or look noticeably better than the original, but it's certainly a bigger meal to digest. With that said, prospective buyers will fall into four categories: * Fans who loved the original Gran Turismo and have actually unlocked all the game's secrets: The purchase of this game is a no-brainer. * Fans who loved the original Gran Turismo but lacked the patience or skills to unlock all the game's secrets: The addition of an off-road rally racing mode won't be enough incentive to rehash a gameplay formula all too similar to the original, despite having more cars and tracks. This might not be your cup of tea. * Those who haven't played Gran Turismo but who love cars and seek a pure racing simulation: The purchase of this game is also a no-brainer, assuming you have a lot of free time ahead. * Casual video gamers looking for fun, easy racing entertainment (or for those shopping for a kids' gift): It's a toss-up. The skill needed to master the nuances of this game, as well as its depth, might prove too much for those looking for a less sophisticated, less demanding racer. The arcade portion of the game will still sate most gamers' needs - but a whole half of the game might go to waste in the meantime. For an in-depth review, keep on reading.... Gran Turismo 2: Crunching the numbers A by-the-numbers look at this pure driving simulation shows how much depth this game offers. First off, the game comes on two CDs. The first CD offers arcade-mode racing, which features one-player races and two-player split-screen competition. When a player places first on a track, a hidden car is unlocked. The second CD is the more valuable of the two; it offers the Gran Turismo simulation mode. In this ultra-realistic, one-player-only mode, you earn credits by winning races - credits that you can then use to buy additional cars and upgrades. To unlock more races, you must pass a series of driving tests (at least 50 to start) to obtain licenses. These licenses can then be transferred (via memory card) to unlock new tracks in the arcade mode; in addition, the cars created in the Gran Turismo mode can be raced head-to-head in the arcade mode as well. For those who've played the original, all this will be familiar territory. For those new to the series, it'll be an overwhelming experience to wade through. Back to the numbers: The game features more than 400 car models from various years, covering everything from lowly compacts such as the Volkswagen Golf to muscle cars like the Chevrolet Corvette. There are also special off-road rally cars and high-performance super sports cars (for the wealthy). These are not mere graphical swaps either, as each car has its own unique performance and handling specifications. The attention to and depth of detail imprinted on each car gives this game virtually enough credibility to stand as an interactive encyclopedia on performance racing cars.<i>--Nelson Taruc</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Resident Evil 2,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Fight Bloodthirsty zombies and other hideous mutations.', 'Resident Evil 2 is the first really big, ultrahyped blockbuster of \'98, and what Capcom has pulled off is more an interactive, cinematic experience than a video game. Seriously. Picking up a few months after the events of the first game, RE2 sees the entire town of Raccoon City hit with the devastating virus that zombified only a few dozen folks in the original Resident Evil. It\'s up to rookie cop Leon Kennedy, and Claire Redfield, sister of one of the main RE characters, to save not only themselves but any and all survivors, to boot. The gameplay remains basically the same as before: As one of two characters, you solve puzzles and shoot monsters. The original Resident Evil featured two playable personas as well, although the differences between the two weren\'t incredibly significant. One could carry more items than the other could, while the other was easier to play, and they both had their own distinct storylines. In Resident Evil 2 the differences between the two are a bit more interesting. For example, Claire starts off with a lock pick, while Leon begins with a lighter, which alone changes the order in which the game\'s puzzles must be solved. Each character also finds different weapons along his or her quest. For instance, Claire will find a grenade launcher, however when playing as Leon, a shotgun will be in its place. In addition, Leon and Claire encounter a string of different characters throughout the game, so naturally their stories don\'t unfold in nearly the same way. The subtle changes between Claire and Leon don\'t make each character\'s story feel completely different, but they\'re enough to make you want to know what happens further into the game.  On top of that, once you play through the game as one character, a second scenario is opened up for the other - for instance, win the game with Claire and you\'ll unlock Leon\'s alternative scenario. (It\'s kind of like Quentin Tarantino\'s Jackie Brown, where you see how one situation or scenario looked from another character\'s perspective.) And since both characters are supposedly running through the many locations of Raccoon City at the same time, the things you do in the first scenario will affect the other character in his or her second scenario. For instance, if you pick up the submachine gun with Leon the first time out and you later go to the same place with Claire, the submachine gun won\'t be there. Admittedly, it\'s mostly cool in concept, since it really doesn\'t come into play that much. What really makes Resident Evil 2 so amazing is simple: It has more of what people liked about the first Resident Evil - weapons, ammo, creatures, and most importantly, many, many instances when you\'ll be genuinely scared. If you played the first game, you\'re sure to remember that your first encounter with a zombie took your breath away, and that you ran scared from the game\'s boss. These types of terrifying moments are commonplace in Resident Evil 2, and the effect is awesome. How does it scare you? Well, as in the great classic horror movies, it\'s a combination of eerie low-key mood music and sound effects such as a lone dog howling at the moon in the distance (that could just be right in the next room), followed by loud, shrieking music played perfectly on cue and sudden jolts of terror, like the arms of a zombie bursting through a boarded up window, right as you happen to be walking by. Things like that.  Of course Resident Evil 2 comes with all of the trimmings: 3D-rendered backgrounds with 3D polygonal characters running through them. Visually, it looks a lot like the first Resident Evil game, except with incredibly improved graphics and character animations. For example, the heroes, zombies, and other creatures now all move with true realism, with head-tracking effects that make them look at what is near them (like a rabid dog or a zombie eating a dead policeman). Also improved over the original is that you can tell the extent of your character\'s injuries simply by looking at his or her body language instead of having to repeatedly check the status screen to see how hurt your character is. There are one of three states: perfectly functioning, holding the side in pain but still functioning properly, and unable to run and in horrible pain. This damage system is both effective and cool. This isn\'t to say Resident Evil 2 is flawless though, as there are some points that could have been improved. Some of the puzzles just seem a little out of place and might make more sense in a different setting... a police station that has a room with three large statues, one with a ruby in its hand, and some sort of pressure-sensitive floor that triggers the ruby to fall out of the statue\'s hand? C\'mon! It\'s not as much a problem as the inventory management system, which hasn\'t been changed at all. As in the first RE, you are only allowed to carry eight items at any time (except for an item that allows you to carry a few more items). You must mindlessly keep bringing items to and retrieving them from these ""magical"" storage bins that somehow share contents with aother bins, and always seem to be really, really far from where you are. If realism is what the developers were shooting for, as it seems to be in RE2, then you should have the ability to set items down wherever and pick them back up again at your leisure, and you should be able to carry more things, too. Really, a key and a rocket launcher don\'t take up the same space or weigh nearly the same.  But in the end, Resident Evil 2 is one of the most entertaining games I\'ve ever played. With its unique camera angles, storyline, graphics, sound effects, and music, Resident Evil 2 seems more like a product out of Hollywood than the video game industry. Resident Evil 2 surpasses its predecessor in nearly every aspect of gameplay, and in short, Capcom has outdone itself.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Duke Nukem: Zero Hour,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"[""While n-Space's Duke Nukem: Time to Kill on the PlayStation was a Tomb Raider-style game that had shooting elements in tow, Eurocom's Duke Nukem: Zero Hour on the N64 is more of a shooting game where you can see yourself, as in Tomb Raider. Like DNTTK though, you act as 3D Realms' trash-talking angry man who travels through different time periods, fighting alien forces that are attempting to repaint human history in harsher, darker hues. Yes, the pig cops and octabrains of sprite-based old have returned in fully polygonal 3D, cantankerous as ever, and even in hi-res if you use the Nintendo RAM Pak."", 'The gameplay in Duke Nukem: Zero Hour is much the same as in previous Duke games: You clear out levels, solve rudimentary puzzles (a step above matching up colored key cards this time), and free captive ""babes."" The levels are sprawlingly large, often quite well designed, and surprisingly atmospheric in hi-res. The ""running around and shooting"" bit that defines the Duke series is well represented here, especially at the points when you face off against alien snipers who are feverishly scanning the environment with their laser-beam gun sights to find you before you can home in on them through your own scope. But the real enemy of Zero Hour is the factor that makes the single-player Zero Hour game almost unplayable, and that\'s the lack of midlevel save points.', ""Besides just spanning miles of virtual real estate, each level is peppered with enemies and demands that you accomplish numerous tasks before you can move on (collecting machine parts, flipping switches, and so on). One wrong move and you've killed fifteen/twenty minutes, easy. For example, at the end of the fifth level, you've destroyed gun turrets, battled Venom gunships, sabotaged an energy generator, and are midway up a ladder leading to the exit when a sniper teleports in and takes potshots at you. Since you can't shoot while climbing, as in DNTTK, you must immediately drop down and find cover, or else you're out. It's a situation that you're not going to be able to overcome the first time through, since it's not something you'd think to prepare for - like knowing that you should peek around a corner to check out a room. You have to die to learn how to beat it, and this example is in now way an isolated occurrence. Imagine it happening a few times per stage and you start to get the idea."", ""Still, that would be all well and good if you had a checkpoint halfway through at which you could save your progress - this doesn't seem like an unreasonable request since you could save anywhere in two out of three Tomb Raider games. Without this feature, the single-player mode is downright infuriating, made up of more than twenty levels that only strategy guide/game reviewers and the most stubborn players will force themselves through."", ""While the multiplayer mode is missing the computer-controlled enemies and the two-player co-op missions that were originally promised by GT, it's quite fun even without them. There are many levels to choose from, each with its own look, feel, hidden passageways, and array of weapons. For instance, the ice level Cool As Ice is full of freeze throwers and puts all the players on skates. Meanwhile, Fogging Hell is full of thick green fog and trip wires - a deadly combination, for obvious reasons. Trip wires and rocket launchers are still favorites for the Dukematches, but the sniper rifle is a welcome new addition. Setting the game to switch levels after each round will inspire many sessions of four-player play, even though the frame rate makes you feel as if you're running in taffy compared with the frame rate of Quake II."", ""In the end, Duke Nukem: Zero Hour is a game that could easily be recommended if only the save system were better. As it stands, you're better off renting it to check out the multiplayer modes with a group of friends, and simply forgetting about playing it by yourself. --Joe Fielder <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Hydro Thunder,,"['original sony playstation game which will also play on play on PS2, complete black label edition']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Hydro Thunder super boat racing video game for the original Sony Play Station (PS1). Bonus boats - bonus tracks -', 'Hydro Thunder is one of those games that prove that timing is everything. The game was rushed to the Dreamcast so that it could have the advantage of being one of the few reasonably good games available at launch, and it ended up being a beautiful, if not painfully exact, arcade port. Now, more than half a year later, the game has landed on the PlayStation. While it\'s obvious the developers spent more time making this version of Hydro Thunder more complete, without the graphical muscle of the arcade hardware or the Dreamcast, the PlayStation version simply isn\'t as impressive. The addition of circuit and time trial haven\'t changed the game a whole lot. You\'re still racing one of nine different boats across 12 different courses in an attempt to place first. Along the way you\'ll run into various obstacles, collect boosters, make insanely huge jumps, and do your best to keep your boat afloat. This basic concept remains the same throughout, as it\'s only trivial details that change between modes. The circuit mode is a somewhat awkward attempt to make the different tracks fit together, as you pick a boat and make money depending on what rank you place in each race. Unfortunately, there\'s nothing to spend your accumulated wealth on, making the mode almost worthless, as you can neither save your progress nor switch boats between races. The time-trial mode lets you race a track without opponents or a time limit, but it isn\'t that useful because you aren\'t allowed to explore the track and look for secret paths. Still, the user interface has been much improved, and it now sports a ""restart race"" command from the pause menu and offers a more comprehensive option menu. Unfortunately, the PlayStation version doesn\'t let you completely customize your controls and instead makes you pick one of three different preset control schemes, none of which emulates the controls of the Dreamcast version. This makes it all the more difficult to pull off boost jumps, as the boost button is now nowhere near the brakes. Hydro Thunder\'s greatest asset was its incredible graphics, which just don\'t translate well onto the PlayStation. While the graphics found on the PlayStation version aren\'t terrible, they definitely hurt the game. All the little graphical touches littering the Dreamcast game aren\'t in the PlayStation version, and some of the effects are so poorly translated that they\'re almost laughable. The frame rate suffers at times, turning into a choppy mess. Gone are the amazing water effects, and the normal water looks so bad it\'s questionable what you\'re actually racing on. Still, there is almost no pop-up, and the graphics are good enough for you to understand what\'s going on. Another department that faced heavy losses was the audio department. While the in-game music is pretty much the same, the audio cues from your navigator and the engine noises are very low quality. Now all the boats pretty much sound the same, and the sound effects have gotten pretty generic. The most apparent change in the sound effects is the noise your booster makes, which is obviously a loop because it gets louder in midrepetition. While some areas of the game have been improved, the incredibly frustrating AI hasn\'t been. It\'s still the case that the computer-controlled opponents are faster or slower depending on which boat you select. If you choose a faster, more difficult boat to control, you\'ll be up against faster opponents. This makes it a bit lopsided, as you get none of the pros but all the cons inherent in choosing a more difficult boat. So, in short, the best boats to select are the slowest ones, unless you\'re less concerned with winning the race than you are with placing the fastest time. Perhaps the most frustrating element of Hydro Thunder is the outright difficulty. You always start in 15th place, and the only way you can win a race is by hitting every boost, taking every shortcut, and hitting no walls. As if that weren\'t enough, Hydro Thunder retains the time gates - an arcade element. This makes finding shortcuts more accidental than intentional, as you\'ve no time to stop and explore the track. Most of the details present in the Dreamcast version were sacrificed, replaced with only a few minor improvements. This is the game, with its improved interface and new game modes, that should have appeared on the Dreamcast instead of the one we\'re familiar with.

Road Rash Jailbreak,,['Action game for Playstation Road Rash Jailbreak.'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Electronic Arts has been making Road Rash games for close to ten years now, and with only a few exceptions, the series has remained true to its motorcycle racing, punching-and-kicking roots. While many hard-core RR fans were disappointed with the series' last PlayStation appearance, Road Rash: Jailbreak fixes what was wrong with Road Rash 3D and delivers a fast, fight-filled racing experience. Along with the return to the roots of the series comes an all-new storyline. In the game's main mode, you'll ally yourself with a gang and advance through its ranks. You advance by placing third or higher on a track. As you complete tracks, you'll earn points for racing and fighting well, and these points in turn grant you extra weapons and nitro boosts. Five-O mode lets you play the role of the police. In this mode, you advance either by arresting thugs to fill your quota or by popping one flashing suspect. You make arrests simply by knocking enemies off their bikes, but it's significantly harder to knock people off in this mode. The game also includes a time-trial mode and several multiplayer modes, like cops and robbers and side car. Graphically, the game isn't perfect. Get more than three or four bikes onscreen and the frame rate takes a huge nosedive. But the bikers and the bikes are modeled well enough, and the game is still very playable. The sound is good, but there's a real lack of varied racer taunts. Gameplay is really what sells the game. The control, particularly with the dual-shock controller, is top-notch. The top buttons control all of your attacks, while the two analog sticks control your throttle and steering. You can also pull off a wheelie, which can be used to launch yourself up and over oncoming traffic. Just don't try to pull a wheelie over a truck.... There are a ton of tracks in the game, but aside from different race locales, the track design isn't too different from track to track. Every track has the same forks in the road, and an onscreen arrow tells you which direction to choose. It's not uncommon for a track to have four or more of these forks, and they really make each track feel generic. Overall, Road Rash: Jailbreak puts the fun back into the Road Rash series, reemphasizing the fighting while still maintaining a good racing experience. If you're into beating motorcycle punks and cops off of their bikes with chains, bats, crowbars, or your bare fists (and hey, who isn't?), then this is definitely the game for you.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

The graphics are better,  the interactive environments are richer, and the addition of new  vehicles adds varied gameplay to an already standout series.', ""Flying a massively powerful attack chopper is still at the core of the  game, but during some missions you'll be able to control tanks or even  Harrier jump jets, which are a complete blast to fly. The mission  objectives are varied, and, fortunately for action fans, there are  plenty of enemies to destroy. If you get tired of taking on the bad  guys, there are also buildings and other ground targets worth  destroying. With so much to blast, you'll likely suffer trigger finger  from the nonstop assault. While fast action is always fun, players  looking for an action game that requires any amount of strategic thought  will likely want to look elsewhere. <i>--T. Byrl Baker</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b>', '<b>Cons:</b>', '', 'For the better part of the 1990s, Electronic Arts has been pumping out games in its ""Strike"" series almost as frequently as its sports titles. Is there that big of a demand? Do the people just like overhead-perspective helicopter games? Do the developers have executives\' children hostage? I mean, sheesh, how in God\'s name has this mediocre series endured such a long run? This isn\'t to say there haven\'t been one or two good entries in the series, but for the most part, the Strike series has had a lot of forgettable installments (I challenge you to try and name more than two off the top of your head - just try). Now Electronic Arts is releasing Nuclear Strike for the PlayStation, a follow-up to last year\'s sorry Soviet Strike. Surprisingly, the game is the best Strike title yet, but that isn\'t really saying much.', ""The premise of Nuclear Strike (like all other Strike games) is simple; you fly around a variety of terrains looking to blow stuff up. That's it. Also, you actually get to pilot a few vehicles that aren't helicopters. Along with the array of choppers that this version has, you also get to take control of some harriers, tanks, and hovercrafts. It's still the same premise (search, shoot, and rescue), but at least there is a little variety to Nuclear Strike's levels, which take you through a variety of lovely locales."", ""Nuclear Strike plays well, but then again, you don't really do much except explore a broad area looking for stuff to shoot. Getting the hang of your vehicle is simple enough, once you figure out which buttons go with which weapons, but you will definitely find yourself consulting the map every few minutes. With so much terrain to explore the game would be much easier if the radar screen were widened. As it is in the finished game, you can't actually tell where you are going at any given time; instead you can only see hostages, enemies, and power-ups in the immediate area. The onscreen targeting, something that was supposed to be improved in this version, is also quite flawed, and it is likely that you will be aiming at something and miss it a good 20 percent of the time."", 'The things lacking the most (and that feel quite dated) are the game\'s graphics and sound, which still haven\'t changed much from the game\'s 16-bit incarnations. Everything is 3D, but the overhead perspective makes everything - from your vehicle, to the enemies, to the explosions - look a bit flat. The sound is pretty forgettable as well, with a droning soundtrack and lifeless sound effects. What saves the game presentationwise are the between-level full motion video sequences. Edited together in a unique way, they tell the game\'s cliched story quite effectively. The acting is a bit on the ""direct to video"" side, but you will get a kick out of the delivery - trust me. And if you get really bored searching around a level to complete your mission objective, your desire to see the next video just might keep you from turning off the PlayStation and throwing your controller in a fit of rage.', ""If you liked the previous entries in this series, Nuclear Strike is a game that you will probably enjoy. As far as shoot-'em-ups go, it's fun, but it lacks anything in the way of innovation. The simple approach suits the game well enough, but you'll definitely feel empty afterwards (and a tad motion sick). In short: Rent, don't buy. You can bet though that Electronic Arts will have another Strike game ready next year (Future Strike), and hopefully it will reinvent the series, rather than just rehash it. --Glenn Rubenstein <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

First, duke it out as one of 10 playable characters (3 of which are from the  popular RPG <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>) in hand-to-hand and weapons-based combat. There are 11 different fighting  environments to tackle, including a moving train and a hovering airship. <i>Ehrgeiz</i> scores points for diversity.  The arsenal of warriors is comprised of various ages, nationalities, and sexes--all of whom are eager to win the ultimate  fighting championship. The prize is a mysterious weapon (the strangely dubbed Ehrgeiz). There are a gazillion moves  to memorize, and the fluid movement and fantastic secret weapons provide great eye candy.', 'In addition to fighting, players will also encounter mini-games, such as the foot race ""Battle Beach"" and strategy game  ""Battle Panel"" (think Othello). This game also contains several elements that will be instantly familiar to RPG fans.  <i>Ehrgeiz</i> may not satisfy gamers who want a dedicated RPG or fighting game, but it does offer a diverse range  of gameplay for the casual gamer with a limited attention span. <i>--Carrie Bell</i>', '<b>Pros:</b>', '', ""Ever since its announcement in late 1997, Ehrgeiz has been one of the most eagerly awaited fighting games for the PlayStation. The collaboration of Squaresoft, Dream Factory, and Namco was a formidable pool of talent that could have rocked the fighting game genre. An earlier marriage of Square and Dream Factory had produced two of the best-looking and innovative 3D fighters for the system, while Namco's prolific console and coin-op record continues to speak for itself. If there ever was a dream team of developers for any one platform, this was it. Unfortunately, by the time Ehrgeiz was officially released in the arcades, much of the graphics, gameplay, and control mechanics did not live up to expectations, and a lot of fighting aficionados found themselves spurned and disappointed."", 'One of the advantages in having the creative forces of Squaresoft behind the design of Ehrgeiz is the accessibility of popular franchise characters such as the protagonists from Final Fantasy VII. Often dubbed ""Final Fantasy Fighter,"" Ehrgeiz allows you to duke it out with Cloud, Tifa, Yuffie, Vincent, and the enigmatic Sephiroth. All things considered, Squaresoft and Dream Factory do a fair job of integrating elements of Final Fantasy into the storyline of Ehrgeiz, which stands alone as an ambitious and intriguing premise. In the distant future, a sword containing an unknown material (hint: materia) was unearthed amidst the rubble of an ancient German castle. The weapon became known as Ehrgeiz, a symbol of power that would represent the strongest fighter in the world. Meanwhile, a sinister organization known as Red Scorpion was assiduously excavating the ruins of an old temple in hopes of finding ancient technology that would give them the edge in biological weapons development. The key to this locked temple, of course, lies with the Ehrgeiz sword and the mysterious materia engraved on its handle. Like Tekken 3, the subplots for each of the characters are beautifully rendered in high-quality motion-captured FMV during the intro and endings. While the notion of a fighting game with a storyline may seem trivial, no one can deny the impact that plot has had on games like Tekken 3 or any of SNK\'s family of fighters. The more fleshed out the characters, the more likely gamers will become attached to their identities. Unfortunately, none of the Final Fantasy characters has its own unique FMV ending sequence. This makes their inclusion appear somewhat haphazard and irrelevant.', ""When Ehrgeiz was first announced and subsequently beta-tested, it was safe to assume that its gameplay was going to be based on Dream Factory's Tobal series. And indeed, as the game took shape and form in the early days, Tobal's trademark stood dominant in the design of Ehrgeiz's fighting system. The developers also added extras to the fray including the strategic use of boxes for offense and defense, multitiered 3D arenas, and weapons that could be picked up during fights. By moving the controller, players could run freely about the stage in an attempt to gain higher ground or just avoid a corner trap."", 'While all of these innovations made their way to the final arcade release and subsequently the PlayStation version, much alteration was made to the heart of Ehrgeiz. For one thing, emphasis was taken off the boxes and items on each of the stages in order to make gameplay more straightforward. Furthermore, a puzzling modification was made to the game\'s blocking system. By some bizarre twist of design that flies in the face of commonsense, Ehrgeiz requires you to leave the joystick neutral in order to block high, while pressing guard makes your character crouch and block low. This is by far the game\'s biggest and most glaring control issue. Be prepared to spend the first hour of the game just getting used to this incredibly unintuitive way to block incoming attacks. To make matters worse, since the game stresses movement in 3D space a la Bushido Blade or the Tobal series, you will find yourself constantly facing away from your opponents and caught with your guard down since the ""auto-block"" is only effective when facing your foe. Luckily, an easy technique to quickly face your opponent is to just tap the guard button. Holding down the guard button and moving about with the controller will allow you to circle your opponent while facing him at all times. This is useful for getting some distance from your opponent by walking backwards or sidestepping without leaving your back open for any attacks. --Chieh Chou <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Need For Speed 4: High Stakes,,"['1 or 2 Players', 'Analog Control Compatible', 'High Stakes Mode', 'Hotter Hot Pursuit', '19 Cars to Collect and Customize']",[],{},"['The <I>Need for Speed</I> series is already established as one  of the best racing game series on the PlayStation. <I>Need for Speed:  High Stakes</I> continues the tradition in fine style by adding several  new elements to the gameplay, and offering a wide variety of tracks and  cars.', 'Where the previous game in the series had you running from the law,  this one has you racing <I>for</I> pink slips. Sure, you can still play  cops and robbers (this time even playing the role of John&nbsp;Q. Law),  but the real fun in this game comes from racing to win so that you can  buy a better car. Once equipped with faster wheels, you can hook up  with a friend to race for titles in the two-player mode.', '<I>High Stakes</I> boasts the best graphics in the series, but they  come at a price: slowdown. All too frequently, we found ourselves  hitting a wall or an opponent\'s vehicle because the game stuttered as  we drove into a graphics-intensive portion of the track. Good visuals  are nice, but they should never come at the expense of gameplay. Still,  when else will you get a chance to blow away a buddy\'s shiny new  McLaren F1 in your ""lowly"" Corvette? <i>--T.&nbsp;Byrl Baker</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Fun tracks and a variety of high-performance vehicles</li> <li>Playing as the cops can be fun</li> <li>Excellent sound effects</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Suffers from slowdown too often</li> </ul>', ""Need for Speed: High Stakes is a good example of how to do a sequel. It doesn't really mess with the formula of the last game, but adds enough new features and options to keep its fans excited. <P>For starters, the game is more cohesive than other NFS games. In High Stakes, you must purchase cars before you can drive them in the game's main mode, the tournament mode. There are several different tournaments, each one having different car requirements and track variations. Also, there are special events, which cost money to enter, but frequently have larger payoffs than the tournaments. Some events are geared toward specific cars, while others put you on the open road, complete with traffic. NFS3's knockout mode has been confined to the special events section. <P>Technically, all the tracks are available for one-player play right at the beginning of the game. However, since each tournament requires a different two or three cars, you'll have to own the proper car to see each of the later tracks. Suffice it to say, you'll be springing for new rides pretty frequently. Placing first in a tournament unlocks the final track of the tourney for two-player and hot pursuit mode use. The track design is fairly varied, and each track can be raced backward, in mirror mode, at night, in the rain, or any combination thereof. <P>Hot pursuit mode is roughly the same, except you can now drive the police car, much like in the PC version of NFS3. As the cop, you're given a set amount of time to stop ten speeding cars. The first few pull off the road without much of a fight, but the later cars won't pull over unless you smash them into the side of the track, forcing them to stop. You're also given the option to call occasionally for backup, set up a roadblock, or set up a tack strip, which pops the tires of the speeder if he fails to avoid it. There's also a two-player version of hot pursuit, but when you play cop vs. speeder in two-player, the cop is on his own. And without being able to call for assistance, the cop is put at an extreme disadvantage. All the speeder has to do is, well, not stop moving. As the speeder in a two-player match, you simply must remain on the lam until time runs out, so you can just get ahead of the cop, flip around, and drive back the other way. As long as you can play a decent game of chicken, you'll never, ever get caught. <P>The graphics in High Stakes are better than NFS3's graphics, but the jump isn't terribly dramatic. The lighting effects, including the sparks that fly after most collisions, are the real stars of the visual portion of the game. The tracks do look very, very nice, and there isn't a lot of pop-up, but as time goes on, the blockiness of the game is undeniable. Also, the framerate isn't constant. The game runs very well in the first-person camera angle, and for the most part, it runs fine in the other two angles. But drive through anything more complex than a simple forest road (for instance, a town), and the game starts dropping frames left and right. <P>NFS:HS has really terrific sound. Most of the music fits the game perfectly, and the sounds of driving (engines, tire squeals, scrapes, and crashes) are all done extremely well. The hot pursuit mode has the bulk of the game's sound, with constant police chatter keeping you aware of The Man's constant vigil. The cops will even speak in their native tongue, which, of course, varies depending on where the course you're driving on is located. <P>The game controls quite well with the dual shock controller, and those of you still playing driving games with the digital pad will also be satisfied with the game's digital control. That said, it still would have been nice to see EA support Namco's Jogcon controller. The game starts off at a nice, easy pace, but eventually the difficulty becomes pretty unforgiving. The later races force you to drive nearly perfectly to win, and scraping a wall or opposing vehicle can be the difference between first place and third. <P>The game's main two-player mode is the game's namesake, the high stakes mode. HS is a two-player matchup that pits your cars against the cars of a friend. But you aren't just racing for mere prestige. In HS mode, you'll be racing for pinks. The winner gets the loser's car to race, sell, or just smile at. Some precautions have been taken to deter some cheaters from keeping their cars after losing them (both players' cars are removed from their cards at the beginning of the race), but you can still simply copy your saved game onto another card before putting your garage on the line. <P>All in all, Need for Speed: High Stakes is a great driving game, but a few of the game's smaller problems keep it from being all that it could be. The inability to call for backup in two-player hot pursuit games is completely unforgivable and keeps the gameplay score from being even higher. The framerate problems and generally pixelated appearance of the game simply show the age of the PlayStation. I, for one, hope the next NFS game appears on a system that can handle a complete graphical overhaul. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Sure, it's an action/RPG in the sense that there's a lot of action, and there are RPG elements in the game, but at its core, Brave Fencer is really more of an action/platformer than anything else."", ""Imagine, if you will, a game that looks like a cross between Klonoa and Gex: Enter the Gecko, and you'll have a fair approximation of Brave Fencer's stylistic approach. The game is made up of polygonal characters and fully 3D backgrounds. Some backgrounds can be rotated 360 degrees, like when you're exploring towns. Other times, the backgrounds remain fixed, so as to let you concentrate on solving the matter at hand, and since problem-solving is a main fixture in Brave Fencer, it becomes apparent that lots of thought went into the design. Each level has its own logical set of challenges that careful thinking will solve every time. It's very rewarding to escape the perils of the first few stages, which neatly sets the tone for the game."", 'Control in the game is very good. If you have a Dual Shock pad, you\'ll be glad to know that Brave Fencer fully supports both analog mode and Dual Shock vibrations. In an RPG of this nature, it\'s fun to feel the hits and spell effects in action. However, if you don\'t have a Dual Shock pad, digital control is just fine, too. In any case, the L2 and R2 buttons control the camera angle, while the square and triangle buttons perform such functions as checking treasure chests, attacking, using the Book of Five Rings, and reading signs. The X button is used for jumps, while the circle button activates the ""get in"" technique. More on that later. Lastly, the R1 button is used for blocking, which, if you want to get anywhere in the game, must be used effectively or else your numerous enemies will make quick work of you. Musashi, when he has the appropriate equipment, can perform all sorts of functions. For example, when you first start the game you must embark on a mission to recover Lumina, Musashi\'s powerful Sword of Light. Additionally, when he finds a certain item, he\'ll be able to climb rock walls using his two swords.', ""One technique that gamers will find particularly useful is the get-in technique. By holding down the block button, a gauge on the side of the screen begins to fill. When the gauge is full, you'll press the square button to throw Raikoumaru (your short sword) in the direction you're facing. Assuming you threw it at an enemy, once it hits he will be immobilized for a few seconds. While your enemy is trapped in this attack, quickly press the square button to absorb his power. Your enemy will disappear, and you will have temporarily gained a new get-in attack, which can be used, at the expense of BP points, by pressing the circle button. Later in the game you will find different spell books. Each book has different attributes, such as the Book of Earth, which can cause earthquakes when properly powered up. Additional sword techniques, like the Ni TenIchi Ryu Slash, may also be learned as the game progresses.

Command &amp; Conquer Red Alert,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""So you've played through Command & Conquer on the console systems, and you need more. That's where the title's thematic prequel, Command & Conquer: Red Alert, comes in. If you want a fix of what you enjoyed in the original, Red Alert certainly has it - though that's definitely a bit of a two-edged sword.  <P>For the uninitiated, typical C&C gameplay finds you on a clouded playing field - in which territories become visible with exploration - with varying degrees of resources (such as money, troops, and buildings). You command your forces to set up bases, raise funds by harvesting minerals, build up manpower (tanks, planes, missile carriers, and so on.), take on the minions of your opposition, and carry out your objectives, which vary mission to mission from defending convoys to leveling enemy bases. It's not uncommon to play the later levels more than five or six times before accomplishing your goals, and since there are two discs full of missions (one for each of the two opposing camps), there's an incredible amount of gameplay time involved here. <P>The drama of war plays out much the same as in the first Command & Conquer, but the cast has changed a bit. Instead of GDI and the Brotherhood of Nod, the two groups are made up of the Allies and Soviets. It seems that some enterprising time-travelling soul (oh, maybe that Albert Einstein guy) has gone back a few decades to take Adolf Hitler out of the picture - for good. A bold move, to be sure, but not one without repercussions. In this revised timeline, the Germans now work along with the rest of Europe to defend against the machinations of Stalin.  <P>Since we're now about 50 years before the time of the original C&C, some of the vehicles and weapons are a little less advanced - although, since Einstein is involved, there's a sprinkling of advanced technology to be found further along, as well. The units, vehicles, weapons, and structures are now fairly different and include MIGS, destroyers, submarines, attack dogs, medics, Tesla Coils (poles that guard your base by lashing out bolts of electricity at enemy troops), camouflaged pillboxes, the Iron Curtain (this stuff is poison), and more. The two sides no longer seem to be simple mirror images of each other, and they have their own unique plusses and minuses. For instance, the Soviets have attack dogs that can wipe out troops quickly, while the Allies have medics that can heal all their soldiers. Similarly, the Allies have vehicles that can move very fast but are short on firepower, while the Sovs have slow, superstrong tanks and missile carriers. Unfortunately, the balance of the two forces isn't quite what it should be, so the Soviets have a clear strength advantage early on in each round. This makes for a bit more of a challenge when playing as the Allies in the single-player game but takes away from a lot of the fun of taking on a friend over the two-player link cable mode. <P>The game also seems to have lost a bit in its conversion from PC to console. The graphics have taken a noticeable bite in quality, though they're still decent and, admittedly, graphics were never incredibly important in C&C to begin with. And, not surprisingly, playing the game with a PlayStation controller instead of a mouse takes away from the ease of play (it is compatible with the PS mouse, but good luck finding one). However, the main frustration is not being able to save at any point in the game. On the slightly frustrating side, this makes it necessary for you to ensure you have a few hours free before you take on an advanced mission. On the very frustrating side, instances frequently occur when you are an hour or so into a level and doing perfectly well, then you just start dogging it and have to start all over from scratch.  <P>Otherwise, be warned that the difference between Command & Conquer and Command & Conquer: Red Alert isn't incredibly major. In fact, Westwood seems to have taken a leap similar to what id took from Doom to Doom II, then Doom II to Quake. There are new weapons, enemies, and levels, but the game engine and basic play are essentially the same. That's not necessarily a bad thing since it is still quite fun, but it's beginning to feel a bit dated. If you're looking for a true sequel to Command & Conquer, you're probably going to have to keep waiting a few more years for the console version of Command & Conquer II: Tiberian Sun. But if you just really want more of the same, with some nice improvements to boot, you'd be well set getting Command & Conquer: Red Alert. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six,,"['PlayStation', 'Video Game', 'Action / Adventure', 'shooter', 'Ton Clancy']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Rainbow Six \n\nTake the reigns of an elite multi-national strike force battling international terrorism in realistic locations around the world in RAINBOW SIX. The game offers a unique blend of strategy, stealth, and plenty of gunfire. The action takes place over 14 pulse-pounding missions that will keep you flipping back and forth from night vision to sniper mode. Each mission begins with your three-member team being dispatched to the perimeter of the enemy compound, and you give them orders on how to proceed from there. All your missions are either hostage rescue or search and destroy tasks. During the course of any mission, you can switch between your team members at will, putting yourself anywhere you want in the action.', 'Have you ever wanted to play hide and seek in an improbably ugly house with deformed terrorists? No? What if guns were thrown in? Maybe? If so, Rainbow Six just might be the game for you. <P>What originally was intended for the PC has come to the PlayStation - with mixed results. The keyboard control, which some found cumbersome, is now gone, but most of the functions have been retained. Both sticks and most buttons (including those of the sticks themselves) are used in the game. Also gone are pesky things like ""good graphics."" While it\'s quite obviously possible to make an attractive PlayStation game, it seems as though the developer didn\'t feel that way. Although it would\'ve been possible to retain the team-controlling gameplay, the developers clearly felt that a standard FPS would be good enough for console owners. Thanks, guys, but there is plenty of more adroit competition in that arena.  <P>Through a mixture of extremely blurry game-engine FMV with a large black border and the startling revelations of a dramatically English-accented woman, we learn that international terrorism is on the rise, and that the development of a crack team of professionals with a silly name is the only possible solution to this problem. That team goes by the code name ""Rainbow."" Perhaps the team hoped the terrorists would be caught off guard by the name. Unfortunately, the team members don\'t have special powers or glittery costumes - it\'s all distressingly military. At any rate, the Rainbows are dispatched to exotic locales (ugly houses, ugly jungles, ugly oil platforms, etc.) and instructed to shoot exotic terrorists (Belgians, Africans, Russians, etc.) and save exotic hostages (white people).  <P>The game\'s setup is thus: Three team members are dispatched to various locations on the perimeter of the enemy compound. You can switch between them at will. There is a fixed goal (saving the ambassador, for example, who is hiding so craftily in the middle of a room as to be beyond detection by mere terrorists) and a somewhat mutable number of terrorists. Terrorists must be dispatched by shot, and they aren\'t particularly suspicious. Perhaps they\'re partially deaf. They have a tendency to pop back up if you switch team members, but they will stay dead if you don\'t. There is actually no need to switch characters if you accomplish the mission using just one man; it\'s actually obviously advantageous to ignore the team-play gimmick.   <P>The control is best described as ""awkward."" The left analog stick moves your character forward, back, and from side-to-side, and the right turns your character. Your highly-trained, hardened soldier has an amusing proclivity for getting caught on doors frames. At times, you must crouch to get through a normal-sized opening - these Rainbows must be tall. The doors are entirely peculiar, actually, because they can\'t swing open unless you back up about six feet. This is probably a good idea, because there might be terrorists just around the corner, although they do have a tendency to be somewhat apathetic until shot at. Once the terrorists are dispatched, it\'s time to hunt for the hostage (or bomb, or other mission objective). The hostages are so deformed-looking you\'ll be tempted to shoot them - but that would force you to have to do the whole thing over again, and ten minutes of mood-killing blue and yellow wallpaper is enough. Apparently, Belgians like their embassies tacky and dysfunctional, which might be why their country is so small. At any rate, press forward - to more walking and killing! This game is simply about military men with boring guns in ugly places saving ugly people. Awkwardly.  <P>The aesthetics of Rainbow Six are just plain bad. There\'s really no other word for it. The environments are just... ugly. Everyone looks deformed, and everything looks tacky and extremely low on detail. The music is... music, and extremely infrequent at that. The sound effects consist of gunshots (which sound like gunshots) and men shouting informative things like ""Got him!"" when you shoot somebody. ""Aesthetically bankrupt"" is not an inapplicable phrase, here. Cool tinges like the blurring effect, which Metal Gear Solid did first and better, are about all you can hope for, and even they only happen during the key-lime nightvision mode.  <P>A cool hybrid strategy-FPS was ripped from the PC and plopped down into PlayStation in an entirely  uninteresting way. While there may be a good number of missions, and many options within each - you can choose team members (but anyone can hold a gun) and guns (but guns are... guns). There are multiple difficulty levels (the terrorists become less oblivious and the damage more realistic) but you\'re probably not going to want to become good enough at this game to move through it without a scratch. You probably won\'t be able to look at the first mission more than twice before you get sick of the wallpaper. The team-leadership idea, which was innovative on the PC, has been completely removed, and while it is possible to use your team members, there really isn\'t much of a reason to. What remains is an uninspired FPS with some weird hostage-saving minigame tacked on. --Christian Nutt <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Shadow Tower (PlayStation),,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Shadow Tower is From Software\'s fourth attempt in the first-person action-RPG genre, following the King\'s Field trilogy (only two of which were released in North America). For those who don\'t know the King\'s Field series, it was a relatively popular first-generation, first-person action-RPG in Japan. You roamed dungeons, fought monsters using different weapons and magic, gain experience, and leveled up. The controls took a little getting used to, plus the game ran at 15 frames per second, causing frustration among some gamers. The game also didn\'t give you much direction; you had to piece everything together yourself. Shadow Tower is pretty similar, save for a few exceptions.The story takes place on the continent of Eclipse, where the holy land of Zepter lies. In this land is a sealed tower guarded by the kings of surrounding nations, keeping to traditions passed down from their ancestors. A long time ago a tragedy descended upon the kingdom of Eclipse. There was a crown with a single eye, and its terrible gaze snuffed out the kingdom in one night, leaving nothing but a gargantuan hole. That single-eyed crown that once glowed so ominously is now closed and quietly sealed within a tower. Ages have passed, and darkness has once again consumed the peaceful land. You will take the role of Ruus Hardy and go into the darkness to fight against evil creatures and monsters in search of the crown with the single eye.Shadow Tower introduces new features and changes from King\'s Field. Pressing different combinations of buttons on your PlayStation controller lets you switch weapons, shields, and magic from your primary to secondary and vice versa. This is very helpful, because one thing that\'s a real nuisance about this game is that accessing the menu screen requires loading (a Now Loading screen even pops up!). The game also eliminates the element of gaining experience and leveling up. Instead, it is replaced with soul points (SP), which can be used to enhance physical and magical attributes, such as hit points (HP) and magic points (MP). SPs are gained by defeating monsters or through special items.The game has also brought along a few elements from the game Diablo, mostly in its use of inventory. Weapons and armor deteriorate as you use them and will eventually break without repair. You can spend your HP to repair worn-out or broken items. This brings a lack of balance to the gameplay because you have a limited number of potions to regain HP. You can only find HP potions in dungeons, by killing monsters, or by trading in items. Surviving the different layers of dungeons is one thing, but trying to keep your HP and weapons at their best is something that can\'t be done easily. Also, you rarely earn money from killing monsters, so you are limited as to what you can buy in stores. The polygonal models of creatures and monsters show that the graphics have certainly improved over King\'s Field, but the frame rate still remains an issue. Although 15 frames per second in King\'s Field seemed bad at that time, looking at Shadow Tower in 20 frames per second still just doesn\'t cut it in these days of 30-60fps games. Even the pilot demo of King\'s Field II (which was only available a few years ago at the Tokyo Game Show in Japan) ran at 30 frames per second. So the technology is there, just not implemented. It\'s too bad.The dark, gloomy overture that plays across the main title might get you excited about the game\'s soundtrack, but the game only contains heavy footsteps and growling, and no music whatsoever. One can respect the developers\' attempt to keep the dark mood and atmosphere by not putting any music in the game, but it just isn\'t effective. Sure, there are certain parts where you are startled at the sudden appearances of evil creatures from dead corpses, but the absence of music is still disappointing. In place of a soundtrack are character voice-overs. But while many of the game\'s characters speak, the voice acting is totally lifeless. You come across a shop and pause. There is silence, and then the store clerk speaks, ""I don\'t care if you\'re human, as long as you\'re a customer."" And then silence again. Very boring stuff.There are other features in the game where you can try to fill an encyclopedia with a complete list of all the creatures in the game. You can also collect rare weapons and armor and place them as bets in a two-player arena mode, but this will likely only attract hard-core players of the game.  <P>Shadow Tower is a blend of King\'s Field and more actioney RPGs like Diablo - a mix that only ends up bringing frustration rather than a sense of adventure. The game was released over a year ago in Japan, and it shows; it looks extremely outdated when compared with current PlayStation games. If you are a hard-core fan of the King\'s Field series, you may want to give this one a try. But others will just be wasting their time. --Ike Sato <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Drivers can pick up crazy power-ups such  as twisters and sonic booms, which send cars in front of them flipping  off the track at the most inopportune times."", 'Graphics are stunning, from the water, trees, and mountains to the eye-popping  detail of more than 30 NASCAR Cup cars and trucks. There are  even seven NASCAR Legends, hidden rides, hidden tracks, and shortcuts,  as well as a head-to-head two-player mode.', 'Purists may prefer <i>NASCAR 2000</i>, also from EA Sports, but in  terms of action, <i>NASCAR Rumble</i> makes for a great trip. <i>--Robb  Guido</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Wild, crazy, insane racing action, especially when you play in  Mayhem mode <li>Gorgeous graphics considering the speed of this game </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Not as deep or realistic as <i>NASCAR 2000</i> </ul>', 'Continuing EA Sports\' ongoing attempts to do to other sports genres what Midway\'s NFL Blitz did to football, NASCAR Rumble is an over-the-top racing game more akin to San Francisco Rush and Beetle Adventure Racing than to NASCAR 2000. Like SF Rush and BA Racing, NASCAR Rumble leaves the raceway for the real world and features power-ups, shortcuts, and a broad general view of physics. The environments span town and country, day and night, but all seem to favor the South, both in location and theme. Power-ups include the standard turbo and invulnerability, and the not-so-standard storm, twister, and freeze, which obscure enemies\' vision, throw them about, and lock them up, respectively. They can also be used against you too, and are often, but their effects can be avoided by simply slowing down enough.  Where NASCAR Rumble really shines is in its replay value, as there\'s a lot to do in the game. You begin as a rookie, and you must win six championships - each made up of four laps of three courses each - before progressing to the pro ranking, and then do it again to gain the elite title. That\'s a lot of racing, almost too much as a rookie, since the difficulty is set a little too low to be challenging. But once you beat each championship, a local racing legend is unlocked for you to race against, and they\'re not called legends for nothing. If you take one on in a championship in the legend mode and manage to beat him, you can race as him from then on, or team up with him in the cyber-team setting. There\'s also a mystery cup composed of three random courses and the EA Cup, which spans six tracks. And you always have the option to increase or decrease the number of power-ups per championship.  NASCAR Rumble also succeeds in providing a consistently fast frame rate while having little or no problems with clipping or pop-up. However, the environments, while varied, are muddy and plain, and the level design has absolutely nothing on Beetle Adventure Racing. But while the graphics can be something of a mixed bag, the sound is perpetually bad. The music in the game is by and large made up of repetitive guitar rock, and the ""color commentary"" comes off like the outtakes from the RC Stunt Copter recording session. Few are funny, and ones such as ""He\'s got savoy-faire,"" and ""Like a rabbit on a dog track"" grate immediately. The multiplayer modes more than make up for that major detraction, because they offer quite a lot. Not only are two-player competitive championships available, but two-player cooperative tournaments and legend team-ups are as well. Sure, the frame rate takes a dip, and pop-up is evident, but neither obnoxiously so. Hopefully, this level of depth will become standard for all racing games. Playing NASCAR Rumble, you get the impression that the developers set out to make a fast and simple racing game with a lot of replay value, and they\'ve very much succeeded. Thing is, it ends up a little too simple to deliver the maniacally addictive experience provided by similar ""unrealistic racers."" It\'s good enough to hope for a sequel filled with even more shortcuts and power-ups though, and if you\'re a PlayStation owner who\'s suffered from N64 envy because of SF Rush and BA Racing, you at least have something similar to help tide you over.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

The control is very slick and easy to pick up. Your vehicle has three different weapons, each of which is useful in different situations. As you progress, you'll be able to put different weapons on your gear, but their uses usually remain the same. The game's autotargeting is a nice touch. A laser sight protrudes from your mech, allowing you to target offscreen enemies with ease."", ""There are two different modes in Future Cop, both of which can be played alone or with a partner. The main mode sets you down in Los Angeles, and you've got to truck across eight different levels to win. Precinct assault mode is a very, very different game. It has a capture-the-flag-type feel to it. Each player has a base with various buttons. Each button constructs a different type of unit, be it a tank, a helicopter, or other, larger units. Building units cost points, which you get for destroying the other player's units. There are also neutral turrets throughout the arena, which can be claimed by getting near them and pressing the action button. The aim of the mode is to get one of your tanks into the opposing player's base. These tanks sort of defend themselves, but pretty much just point at the enemy base and keep moving until they make it or get blown up. When playing against the computer, your opponent will be Sky Captain, a flying drone with a pretty amazing voice."", ""The graphics in Future Cop look nice. There's some decent light sourcing used throughout the game, and most of the buildings and enemies look nice. The explosions are a high point, both from a graphical as well as an aural standpoint.

In total, you must perform an intriguing balancing act to beat each track: Finish first while ""wasting"" enough time to try big-point tricks.', 'Thanks to the many shortcuts and bonuses - and a very challenging AI - the tracks hardly get tiresome. Furthermore, the speed, control, and graphics seem to strike an excellent rapport with the gameplay design. The game runs at a crisp frame rate throughout the track, with never any slowdown (even in split-screen mode). For the most part, pop-up is kept out of view. The control feels very fluid, and it seems programmers made sure to eliminate points on a track where gamers could get stuck or glitch up - a malady of poorer games in this genre. Even more important, improvements made to snowmobiles actually have beneficial effects that you can feel in the control. The graphics overall look solid, and some lighting effects are rather impressive - notably in later stages when night racing becomes available (another challenge gamers must adapt to).', 'As for its audio, Sled Storm gets good marks for getting real-life ""extreme-sports-worthy"" artists - such as Rob Zombie and Econoline Crush - to populate its soundtrack. Their musical offerings blend in well with the game\'s intense racing mentality, while the sound effects and racer trash-talk seem adequate enough.', ""If this review sounds more like an infomercial to you skeptical gamers, it's because this writer tried long and hard to find flaws - and they were few and far between. The challenge might be a little high, since you get only three lives to complete a championship. Fortunately, there's a nifty option to turn off automatic catch-up by computer racers, which evens the odds a bit. Some of the forest textures looked flat on some tracks, and it would've been nice to have an option to play your own music CD during a race - but frankly, these complaints hardly affect the bottom line: For any gamer looking for a uniquely fresh adrenaline rush, Sled Storm makes for one very worthy purchase. --Nelson Taruc <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Xenogears' reliance on story, subtlety, and mood make it Square's most anime-like RPG thus far, in many ways making the game one of its best."", 'Staged on a human colony far in the future, Xenogears\' story centers around the war between the nations and their endless power struggle. With the nations constantly dueling for power and resources, warfare has escalated to new levels thanks to enormous humanoid robots called ""Gears."" Trapped by destiny in the middle of the crisis\' latest escalation is the game\'s stereotypically-named Fei Fong Wong. Exiled from a peaceful burg on the brink of war, Fei scours the world with his allies for clues to his past and the unknown destructive power that dwells within him.', ""Like a number of anime features, Xenogears' story is hard to put a finger on. The game's beautiful introduction sequence explains nothing and, at first glance, bears no relevance to the game. This trend continues throughout the game - when questions are answered, a slew of others open up, leaving one in a constant state of cluelessness. As opposed to a Final Fantasy game's primary goal of defeating the villain and saving the world, the driving force behind Xenogears' is resolving the game's excellent story. While it has its humorous moments, Xenogears's story is serious - so serious that it was almost never released in the United States. Rife with religious overtones and criticism, Xenogears often asks us to question our very being. While a little preachy at times, this is used well to enhance the story and our understanding of the game's deep characterizations."", 'Xenogears plays differently than just about every RPG out there. This is most noticeable within the game\'s dual battle systems. When Gear-less, one has the standard RPG options at his disposal: attack, defend, magic, item, and run. Attacking is where the game differs most, as you are given a number of attack points for every turn. After opting to attack, the player can perform a series of moves, costing one, two, or three attack points each. Certain combinations of moves will result in more powerful attack combos, learned throughout the game. Additionally, leftover attack points can be stored up and used to string together massively destructive combinations of combos with a sixth battle option. When riding a Gear, one\'s attack options are similar but different enough to keep things interesting. Instead of using attack points for player combos, Gears come equipped with a large stash of fuel. Each move requires 10, 20, or 30 fuel points, and super-combos require more. As running out of fuel would be a problem, a ""charge"" move restores a small amount of fuel points but leaves the Gears open to attack. Finally, a ""booster"" option speeds the Gear up for more frequent attacks but sucks 30 fuel points away every turn it\'s active. A definite change from the Final Fantasy series, spells play a very small role in Xenogears, mostly serving defensive purposes, and are learned through the age-old ""get a level, get a spell"" system.', ""With its different style of game and story, Xenogears is accompanied by an art style vastly different from that seen in other Square games. Each town and dungeon is presented polygonally from an overhead view, where pressing the left or right shoulder buttons will smoothly rotate the scenery. All characters in these scenes are sprite-based. Battles are presented in a combination of 2D and 3D, with most characters in 2D and the Gears in 3D. Xenogears is Square's first game to use actual anime and voice acting, mostly found only in the game's awesome movies. Unfortunately, the concept isn't pulled off as well as similar executions, namely GameArts Japanese RPG hit, Grandia. The game's character sprites are poorly animated and suffer from terrible pixelation, no doubt due to the PlayStation's limited RAM. Xenogears' robot and town designs are full of detail and panache, but their textures constantly wiggle and distort when the camera pans about, giving the game's geometry a less-than-solid, gelatinous look. The game's color in general is bland and washed out. Finally, the game's spells use the PlayStation's more 2D effects well, much like Final Fantasy Tactics' elaborate spell animations. Xenogears doesn't look bad by any means, just substantially unpolished when placed next to Final Fantasy VII or Tactics. However, the beautiful anime sequences skillfully combine top-notch hand-drawn animation with rendered graphics a la Ghost In The Shell's cinematics."", ""Featuring music from Chrono Trigger's composer, Yasunori Mitsuda, Xenogears expertly uses audio to push the story along. Many tracks include voice or chanting and all are appropriately uppity or low with the game's mood. Much of the game, however, uses silence or ambient noises, making parts of the game's soundtrack a tad sparse. To go along with the anime cutscenes, Xenogears is also Square's first foray into including in-game voice-overs. With a few rare exceptions, the voice outside of the movies is limited to grunts and other attack-type noises and usually end up getting drowned out in the game's music. Unfortunately, just when you might have thought Square was ready for all-digital sound, the rest of the game's sound effects lamentably follow Square's standard, uninspiring synthesized formula."", 'Xenogears is an excellent, thought-provoking RPG with enough story and original gameplay to warrant a look, even if the gameplay could use a little graphical polish. --Peter Bartholow <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Road Rash 3D,,"['MEMORY CARD 2 BLOCKS', 'DOLBY SOUND', 'ORIGINAL THRASHING SOUNDTRRACK']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['ULTIMATE FIGHT THE FINISH LINE...ALL NEW 3D WORLD WITH 100 MILES OF INTERCONNECTED ROADS FULL CONTACT TEETH CLENCHING BLAST ON TREACHEROUSE CANYON RIDES, HIGH SPEED REEWAYS AND CROWDED STREETS WHERE TWISTED BIKERS TEAR IT UP!', ""The mainstream press likes to trot out EA's Road Rash series as an example of what horrible games people are playing these days whenever the subject of video game violence is brought up. Why? Because the player must often punch, kick, or drive fellow racers or, going one further, pursuing policemen, into obstacles such as oncoming traffic to win the race. It's sensational cartoon violence almost at its best, and it's been with us for so long it seems almost a given, which goes to show that people who only observe the games will never understand how fun and perhaps innocuous they are to play. <P>And it's the gameplay, not the violence, that's noteworthy in the latest leg of the Road Rash order. This model boasts improved 3D graphics, more realistic handling, wilder and more varied tracks, better fighting, and improved animation, which it accomplishes with varied degrees of success. While the gameplay is much the same as before (avoid oncoming cars, signs, and other objects; hit people on the head, snag their crowbars or pipes, hit them on the head again; stay on the track, get money for winning, buy better bikes; and so on), it's a formula that's difficult to grow tired of and essentially works here, too. And a few of the characteristics have been recognizably brought to the next level.  <P>The control, for example, is much more concise than before. With the basic Sony controller, it's solid, manageable control, while with the dual analog controller, it's a dream. It's so much smoother in fact, it's almost an entirely different game. The analog really excels on some of the more twisty mountain pathways, and when you throw in a bike with a better turning radius and superior handling, you're set. The racing controls are also very responsive to split-second reactions, which are occasionally necessary as you can jump moving cars and such by popping a wheelie at exactly the right moment. <P>The courses are formed from connecting points, or various stretches, in a large environmental grid. In one race, you might run from point A to C and then from C to F and F to I before the race is complete. Then in another race, you might race from I to F and F to E then E to A - using different stretches within the same grid system, though sometimes in a different combination and/or direction. This reusing of track sections doesn't end up as cheap as it might sound - since it melds different courses together, with a lot of bits to meld - and provides a fair amount of value in its overall variety.  <P>But even though the graphics, track design, and just about every aspect of the title comes out well, it's still a PlayStation game, so of course there's pop-up. But with the careful placement of some nice graphical tricks, it's not overt or overwhelming and ends up being roughly as unobtrusive as in EA's Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit. And while it's sometimes a strain to distinguish the cars from the visual noise in the cityscapes, the designers had the foresight to make oncoming cars honk when you're in their lanes - a treatment that corrects this problem most of the time.  <P>Road Rash 3D starts off fairly easy, but soon becomes quite challenging. It's a difficult game to master, but not to the point of being mind-numbingly frustrating, like, for instance, Midway's Top Gear Rally for the N64. In fact, it's a pretty forgiving racing game. You can crash once or twice and still come out in first place if you play your cards right the rest of the race. And since the tracks become very long, very quickly, it's necessary to have a margin of error on your side. <P>As in the first CD version of Road Rash, the musical score for 3D is composed of tunes from actual rock bands. The earlier rev included the likes of Soundgarden, Hammerbox, and Paw, and now it's the Mermen, Sugar Ray, CIV, and a few others. The soundtrack doesn't have the highs of the original, nor does it have the lows (it's hard to figure out in which category Paw's Jesse would end up). At its worst, however, it's decent music to have playing in the background, but that's about the best it gets, too. <P>While the glitches in RR 3D are not abundantly obvious, the title is not flawless. The weakest point in the chain would have to be the game's fighting element. What was once a fairly large part of RR gameplay has now been trimmed back to an infrequent slap in the face with a two-by-four. The competing racers spend their time beating on each other instead of taking you on, though perhaps that's for the best since as the player, your moves take so long to follow through that you'll be flat on your back before your swings or kicks even come close to connecting. <P>So what's really keeping Road Rash 3D from being positively incredible is the occasional graphical glitch, the lack of a two-player mode (included in some of the earlier RRs), and the reduced fighting element. In the end, Road Rash 3D's a great single-player racing game; it just turned out less Road Rash than most die-hard fans of the series would have liked. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert - Retaliation,,['Disc plus hard plastic protective case only. Disc condition ranges from flawless to scratched but is guaranteed to work.'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Manual for Command & Conquer Red Alert Retaliation - for Playstation', ""There is at least something to the belief that console owners would rather blow things up than deal with advanced strategy, and never has that been more apparent than in Westwood's Command & Conquer: Red Alert: Retaliation for the PlayStation. It quickly becomes evident after dealing with even the first handful of missions - which require the exact use of key personnel at precisely the right times or that goals be met before the rapidly ticking clock runs out - that the game could've been better adapted for the console set, perhaps even by adding in a few basic search-and-destroy missions in the start. Even the stages that are more straightforwardly destructive require maintaining a war on two fronts or provide limited resources to build your forces up with. <P>The game itself is an adaptation of two add-on packs created for the PC game Command & Conquer: Red Alert, the prequel to the original Command & Conquer game. As before, you take on the role of one of two opposing armies, commanding your troops and vehicles to take out enemy forces, while defending your base and harvesting materials to keep the old war machine running. Some missions demand more precise goals than simply overrunning your opponent, such as sneaking spies into his camps to learn shipping routes or even commanding a small platoon of soldiers, sans base and vehicles, within an enemy research facility. <P>But if you don't already know all about Command & Conquer, C&C:RA:R is a horrible game to start with. On the PC side, it's understood that if you buy an add-on pack, you've already played earlier missions, because owning the basic game is a prerequisite to playing them. But that's not the case here, and those who hope to pick it up as their first taste of C&C will walk away entirely frustrated. It's a shame that Westwood couldn't follow the lead of perhaps one of the companies out there adapting PC games to better fit the console market (3DO with Uprising X, Crave with Battlezone, and so on) by either adding some simpler and more explosive extra missions or altering the preexisting ones to better suit the console market. Having complex mission after complex mission without a few easy victories sprinkled in between can be an arduous experience. <P>The same criticisms that were leveled at Command & Conquer: Red Alert also apply here: The graphics aren't nearly as good on the PlayStation version as the PC, and playing the game with a PlayStation controller instead of a mouse takes a lot away from the ease of play (the PlayStation mouse is incredibly rare). But the largest complaint - not being able to save at any point as in the PC version - is further compounded because of the game's extreme level of difficulty, leading to matches where you'll end up having wasted hours of fighting and planning because you made a crucial error near the end. <P>If you're a fan of the console ports of this series and are looking for another round of challenging missions (the likes of which might have taken you several days each to accomplish in the earlier versions), then you're definitely on target with this game. But newcomers and the more action-oriented of you out there beware: This one's not for you. Certainly the original PC add-on pack designers should be applauded for not just creating more of the same, but having such a high difficulty level without being able to provide a better save system seems to point out that this may have been an inappropriate port for the system. It's of course a great PC strategy game, but one that's either not very well suited or not very well adapted for console audiences. Or both. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

As with <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i>, you must find and capture creatures, and you can trade them with your friends.', 'While 151 pocket monsters wander through the various <I>Pok&eacute;mon</I> games, <I>Dragon Warrior: Monsters</I> features over 200 monsters to collect in this single title. When you have captured them, you can breed and train your monsters to develop special skills. With the optional game link cable, you can battle or breed with other monsters captured by a friend.', 'Dragon Warrior was one of the defining series of RPGs back on the NES. Most DW fans are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Dragon Quest VII, the first Dragon Warrior game to appear on the PlayStation. But fans of the series as well as fans of Pokemon (the game, not the phenomenon) should definitely take a look at Dragon Warrior Monsters. DWM puts you in the role of a small boy named Terry. Your sister has been kidnapped and dragged to a mysterious kingdom populated by monsters and monster trainers. You, in hopes of freeing your sister, must become the world\'s best monster trainer. Many of the game\'s monsters have been taken from earlier incarnations of the series, so expect to see the little dew-drop slimes, crazy-looking bats, and the like. You\'ll walk through various landscapes, fighting and, if you\'re any good, catching monsters to add to your roster. Battles occur in typical RPG fashion, with your monsters doing all of the fighting. Unlike in Pokemon, all of your monsters fight at once, and you occasionally battle more than one foe. As you progress, your monsters will level up, and you\'ll earn money and items. The money is mostly needed to enter monster fighting tournaments, though you can, of course, also buy things like healing herbs and warpwings. You progress through ranks in these tournaments, much as in Bio Motor Unitron for the Neo Geo Pocket or Monster Rancher for the PlayStation. If you win the tournament, you\'ll be allowed to represent the kingdom in a larger tournament, which in turn will get you closer to freeing your sister. The graphics in the battles are great. The monsters all look very sharp. Out of battle, you\'re represented in typical small-guy RPG fashion, with your train of monsters following behind you. The soundtrack is well composed, and as such the music is always a welcome part of the game. If you\'ve already ""caught \'em all,"" and you\'re looking for a game to tide you over until Pokemon Gold and Silver are released near the end of the year, Dragon Warrior Monsters is exactly what you\'re looking for. It may not have the cutesy, over-merchandised appeal of Pokemon, but the rock-solid gameplay makes it a worthwhile endeavor.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Namco Museum 64,,['a great little game for nintendo 64'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['Don\'t be thrown off by the title of this game--the artwork in this museum isn\'t the stuff that field trips are made of. Instead, it\'s a course in ancient video gaming that focuses on six of the format\'s most important historical figures. Start with the arcade version of the first family: <I>Pac-Man</I> and <I>Ms. Pac-Man</I>. Sadly, Namco didn\'t include ""Pac-Man Fever"" on the soundtrack. The next exhibit showcases variations from the top-down shooter period: <I>Galaga</I> and <I>Galaxian</I>. Drive by <I>Pole Position</I>, an early milestone in gaming realism, and finally to <I>Dig Dug</I>, an early milestone in gaming surrealism, where the object is to dig underground and pump enough air into subterranean monsters to make them burst. Remember: those who don\'t know history are doomed to repeat it.', 'The Namco Museum series lasted five games on the PlayStation, collecting old Namco arcade titles ranging from the important (such as Pac-Man, Dig-Dug, and Galaxian) to the obscure (do Toy Pop, Grobda, The Tower of Druaga, and Phozon ring a bell?). The Nintendo 64 edition of the line acts as a ""best of"" the museum tour , gathering together the premium classic games from the company\'s past: Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Pole Position, Galaga, Galaxian, and Dig Dug. Every gamer older than ten should be well familiar with the pellet-chomping, maze-running Pac-Man games, though some might not recall the other titles as clearly. Pole Position was the perennial racing game of its time, offering much-improved graphics to a genre that had seen the rudimentary-looking Night Driver not too much earlier. Meanwhile, Galaxian and Galaga were more stylish takes on Taito\'s Space Invaders, each having its own distinct variation on the theme (the first offered diving ships, while the second had enemies that could capture your craft in a tractor beam, for example). And Dig Dug? This little game remains hard to explain even today. Playing as what must be a gardener wearing a space suit, you dug into the ground to root out monsters (the goggle-wearing balloon Pooka and the fire-breathing dragon Fygar) either by blowing them up using an air pump or causing rocks to drop down on top of them. The graphics and sound in the games are, of course, incredibly dated by today\'s standards, but, nonetheless, all remain almost as addictive today as when they first came out. Few classic-game collections come close to providing such a strong lineup. While many of Midway\'s compilations had a few standout titles, most that appeared were second-tier games or ones that didn\'t hold up to the test of time very well. The Namco Museum line for the PlayStation saw this even more than the Midway collections. And while some comps suffered from imperfect translations, the games on this one feel arcade perfect, save for some occasional trouble catching corners in Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man using the N64 controller. It\'s likely that you\'ll find at least one game among the six that will make the collection worth picking up for you, but it could certainly be all of them, making this the surest classic compilation to ever recommend.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Activision set out to make a shooter with a very action movie-like quality. Figuring that they\'d need a big action-movie guy involved to really make it fly, they got Bruce Willis on board. His face was scanned, and his voice was recorded for the project, the theory being that Bruce would star ""in"" the game. The original plan was to have Bruce play your sidekick, a guy that would run around and back you up while you shot up the place. But as the development time dragged on, the conclusion was drawn that people don\'t want to be alongside Bruce. People wanted to be Bruce. So the sidekick idea was scrapped, and instead you take on the role of Trey Kincaid, scientist-turned-outlaw. The game\'s changed perspective may have been a good idea at the time, but it also caused the game\'s main problem. Since all the voice work was written to work with Trey as your sidekick, it all sounds like he\'s talking to someone that isn\'t there. Plus, what was left in really isn\'t very good. Most of the phrases really lack feeling, and they\'re mixed horribly. It sounds like they just trapped Bruce in a bathroom with a mini-tape recorder and got him to read the script. Also, the lack of variety (you\'ll hear ""Open up a can of whoop-ass"" and ""Ooh! I... feel... gooood!"" more than a few times) leads you to believe that most of the voice work was unsuitable after the transition. And since getting Bruce back in the studio was probably impossible (hey, Bruce is a busy guy), we\'re left with whatever quotes they could salvage from the existing audio. The gameplay is surprisingly fun for a shooter of this type. The controls are set up in a Robotron or Smash TV-like setting (analog is a must here), but the game has a running and jumping atmosphere more along the lines of ASC Games\' One. For a 3D game with a lot of jumping, the camera does a pretty nice job of presenting the action in an easily viewable fashion. But it isn\'t perfect. The White House level is the biggest offender. The perspective gets in the way of your jumping quite a few times in that level, causing more than a few deaths when you think you\'re judging the distance properly but miss a platform by a long shot and die in the lava. But overall, the gameplay is really intense, although the game as a whole is really quite easy. The last two levels of the game are reasonably challenging, though. The game has got a nice graphical look to it, with occasional panning cameras and nice perspective changes. It really gives the game a very dynamic feel. The game\'s frame rate tends to fluctuate a little bit, but it remains fast enough throughout the game, right up until the final boss. The final boss stage has some serious slowdown problems, which in turn cause some poorly judged jumps, which in turn cause needless (not to mention extremely annoying) deaths. Other than the poorly executed Bruce Willis speech, the game\'s sound is nice. The fire and explosions give the game the feeling of a real battlefield. The whoosh of the flamethrower is especially nice. The music is also well done, including a track by Poe (that\'s how long this game has been in development. When they first announced Poe\'s involvement, it was a reasonably big deal), who also plays the part of Plague in the game. Overall, Apocalypse is a really fun shooter with a great concept, but portions of it are poorly executed. All in all, the developers really wasted Bruce Willis\' talents and missed an opportunity to do something extremely cool. If they had set out from the beginning to make Apocalypse a one-man game, none of the major problems with the fragmented storyline and poor speech would even exist.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

A Bug's Life,,['For the Nintendo 64'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"[""Like any medium, the video game has a target audience. Every game ever produced has been geared toward a specific type of player, and as such, children's video games often have a distinct simplicity. A Bug's Life, however, deftly avoids that stereotype and delivers a worthwhile experience to a more mature audience without losing its appeal to those who are younger. Following the plot of the movie, you, as Flik, a young and adventurous ant, must save Ant Island and its inhabitants from the evil Hopper and his army of grasshoppers. This quest revolves around a jaunt into the city to recruit other insects to help you defeat the more-powerful grasshoppers. To do this, you rely on your attunement to nature and manipulate magic seeds scattered about the area. Tokens found within the level allow these seeds to grow into various types of plants that accomplish different goals. Some seeds can be moved, and some are needed to accomplish more than one task. On top of this, you'll have to avoid the hordes of respawning ant predators who'd like nothing better than to have a tasty Flik steak. Enemies can be eliminated in one of two ways: by jumping on them, Mario-style, or by tossing a berry their way. You can find more-powerful berries about the level, most of which will auto-target your enemies. I was really let down by the game's complete lack of cutscenes. You would think that with all that computer-generated material to draw from, converting some of them to in-game cinemas would be a no-brainer. However, this game has none of that. Instead, it uses stills and text to tell the story. The game's levels are nicely rendered, enemies are distinctly identifiable (retaining Pixar's cartoon style), and lighting is done well. Disney paid good attention to small details, and added some welcome surprises, such as giving Flik a backpack to wear on some of the levels and letting Flik explore the insides of overturned bottles. Unfortunately, there is a large amount of fog in most of the outdoor levels, making things difficult to deal with. Easily the biggest difficulty in this game is working with the sometimes horrible camera angles, and you'll find yourself switching to the nonmoving camera just to manually adjust your viewpoint more than once. The soundtrack's upbeat muzak-like score may have you reminiscing of shopping at a grocery store, but at least it's nonabrasive and fits the game's theme. The game is peppered with sporadic uses of voice, as Flik makes comments about items that he discovers, or about enemies he takes out; this is cute at first, but it soon gets extremely annoying. Unfortunately, enemies don't make much noise, and the other sound effects are pretty weak. Aside from some complex uses of the seeds, this game can be simplified to walking around while constantly pressing the berry-throw button. While using all the seeds in the level lead to rewards, the game can be beaten with a minimal amount of effort, which, I'm sure, appeals to younger audiences. Children looking to relive the fun of the movie should be pleased with the simplicity of the game, while older audiences might enjoy the complexity behind using the seeds to gain the level's secrets.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Vigilante 8,,['N64'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Cartridge and hard plastic collector case with reprint of original case artwork - NO MANUAL - Front label is fully in tact. Game cartridge is in good condition but may show normal signs of age such as minor scratches, discoloration, or debris in creases. All games are tested before being put into our inventory.', ""Vigilante 8 was one of the most celebrated car combat games on the PlayStation, and I'm pleased to say that with new multiplayer options and improved graphics the N64 version is even better. For those of you unfamiliar with the premise of the game, let me explain it. The basics of gameplay are simple: You drive around a 3D landscape in one of 12 vehicles that you can outfit with various weapons you find in the level. Within each level there are other vehicles you must destroy  so you can advance. You ultimately want to get through all of the levels to see the happy little ending for each of the characters. Each level in the single-player game has a specific mission that you must complete. The missions are simple: You do things like protect a specific structure - like a bank or gas station - within the level. However, depending on which character you pick, you may be asked to destroy a specific building. Either way, it always seems to end up with you seeking out the competition and blowing it to smithereens. Right off the bat, the most important things to note about the N64 version of Vigilante 8 is that it has a new level that wasn&#x92;t in the PlayStation version, and that it supports four-player simultaneous play, compared with the original PlayStation version, which only supported two. Equally important in both versions, though, is that it's really enjoyable how alive the environments are. For instance, when you're battling the other vehicles in the aircraft graveyard, huge planes are trying to take off. When you find yourself on the canyon level you&#x92;ll find a locomotive going about its way. What&#x92;s even better is that all this extra stuff within the levels can be blown up. Sure, there&#x92;s no good reason to do so, but it&#x92;s hella fun. My favorite thing to do is blow up the supports of the train bridge and watch the whole thing come tumbling down. And, actually, some good can come out of blowing things up, as you may, for instance, find a hidden weapon or other power-up, like a shield, behind a building.  Controlling the vehicles in Vigilante 8 is extremely easy and intuitive. You steer the cars using the analog stick, and fire rockets, machine guns, and other various weapons with the buttons. The physics used for the cars makes them fun to drive since they&#x92;re an exaggerated version of real-world physics. For example, if a big explosion or a special weapon goes off near your car, it's likely that you&#x92;ll go flying - and far, at that.    Visually, Vigilante 8 on the N64 is quite impressive, a bit more so than the PlayStation version. The lighting effects used for the explosions and laser blasts are really extraordinary. The polygonal vehicle models look even more detailed and move more realistically than before. Even the environments look a little more defined, making it easier to see secrets and things not noticed before in the PlayStation version. The pop-up or level fill-in is probably the only thing you could complain about if you had to; however, it doesn&#x92;t affect the gameplay in any way.  Vigilante 8 on the PlayStation had incredible music, thanks to the CD that carried it. The N64 version, of course, doesn&#x92;t use the CD medium, so the music has been watered down a bit and turned into fairly decent midi renditions of the original music. The sound effects and character taunts you hear throughout the battle really add to the games free-for-all feel.   In the end, Vigilante 8 for the N64 is not only the best car-combat game for the system by default (there aren't any others), but with its great multiplayer options, it even has a bit of an edge over its PlayStation counterpart. I'd recommend Vigilante 8 to anyone, especially to people who play a lot of multiplayer games with friends. The only negative thing about the game is its brief single-player mode, which literally takes less than an hour to beat per character.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Characters and backgrounds take on a much more detailed, realistic look through enhanced 3-D graphics and are seamlessly combined with nearly an hour of stunning computer-generated cinemas.', ""In early 1999, Final Fantasy VIII for the Sony PlayStation sold millions of copies within days of its release in Japan. Now, one year later, the epic role-playing game has become available for the PC with much less fanfare surrounding its publication, probably because most everyone who wanted to play Final Fantasy VIII already has. What's more, the PC version of Final Fantasy VIII seems hell-bent on completely alienating its audience of innocently curious computer gamers, as they'll likely end up utterly bewildered if they ever made the mistake of buying it. That's because Final Fantasy VIII for the PC is a completely inadequate conversion of the attractive yet problematic console role-playing game. Final Fantasy VIII would have looked and sounded much better if it were originally a PC game. It might look good on a television, but on the PC you'll immediately notice all the flaws in Final Fantasy VIII's graphics. The characters are made of simple polygonal shapes, and they're painted with blurry, low-resolution texture maps. The background scenery fares even worse; the game's characters look sharper and much more detailed compared with the washed-out settings throughout the game. This makes everything clash and makes the whole game look much worse than it should. You can tell Final Fantasy VIII is a beautiful game underneath it all; the composition and design of virtually every scene are of exceptional quality. The game has a cohesive cinematic appearance, consistently inventive artistic design, and remarkably high production values throughout, even though its appearance is mired under what seems like a coat of dust. That's the problem: Although Final Fantasy VIII looked stunning on the PlayStation, its visuals seem to lose far too much quality in translation to the PC. You'll frequently get frustrated looking for the hotspot to exit a screen; then again, you'll also frequently witness some of the most impressive computer-generated cinematic sequences ever made. The game's frame rate is fairly smooth during most gameplay sequences, but it slows to a crawl whenever you're traveling between destinations on the 3D map. Even its soundtrack suffers from the translation, because it was originally designed to be played through the PlayStation's proprietary music synthesizer; but on the PC, the game's epic score just sounds twangy and annoying, because most PC sound cards are ill equipped to emulate the PlayStation's electronic instruments. Fortunately, Final Fantasy VIII generally looks good enough that you could learn to tolerate the shortcomings of its translated graphics and sound; the characters may lack detail, but they're so vividly motion-captured that they'll captivate you anyway. But Final Fantasy VIII's greatest technical feat has to be how it manages to interpolate 3D characters onto static backgrounds that seamlessly shift into pre-rendered full motion video. There are several scenes throughout the game that blend gameplay sequences with cinematic cutscenes so seamlessly and so beautifully that it's impossible not to be impressed at the sight of them. Though it may take some effort on your part to put up with Final Fantasy VIII's muddled visual quality, it'll be even harder to deal with how the game plays. Final Fantasy VIII features a great story that uses some of the most common, most obvious plot devices - love, friendship, time travel - and somehow manages to make them interesting and complicated, yet completely accessible and even rather plausible. But to get to the heart of the story, you must wade through countless random monster encounters and other tedious gameplay sequences that will try your patience to the very limits. Worse yet, because the PC version is a straight port of the PlayStation game, you must navigate the game's complicated menus and controls using just a keyboard or a gamepad. Yet the game's most embarrassing throwback to its console roots has to be its save-game system, which reads your hard drive as though it were a PlayStation memory card. Even so, as with the ported graphics, you might grudgingly learn to deal with the console-style controls. Unfortunately, coping with the game's gaudy and far-too-slow combat sequences will probably take a lot more effort than the game is worth. <I>--Greg Kasavin </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

The Last Express - PC/Mac,,['collectable'],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<I>The Last Express</I> allows you to move freely through the rich and detailed 3-D environment of the world's most luxurious train, circa 1914, during its final European crossing prior to the outbreak of WWI. <P> Game play involves interacting with characters, exploring objects, engaging in action sequences, and uncovering multiple story threads--with your perspective shifting from first person to third person for maximum dramatic effect. <P> Information gained is used to piece together a series of interrelated puzzles, which advance you through the story. If you are clever enough, you ultimately discover the shocking secrets of The Last Express ... before it's too late!"", 'Who would have thought that Jordan Mechner, the man behind such action classics as Karateka and Prince of Persia, would design one of the most innovative adventure games of the last few years? Upon closer examination, Mechner\'s involvement with The Last Express makes sense: Karateka was the among the first games to be emotionally engaging, with small cutscenes adding a narrative layer that was unheard of in the early Eighties. The Last Express is revolutionary in a similar way - through its use of real time and brilliant writing, the game ups the ante for storytelling in gaming. And if it weren\'t for a few gameplay issues, The Last Express could very well be among the best adventure games ever. <P> Taking place on the Orient Express immediately before the outbreak of World War I, The Last Express is a tale of international intrigue, a love story, and a murder mystery all at once. While this may sound trite, the intelligent writing overcomes the cliches through its complex characters, unpredictable plot twists, and some of the most convincing voice acting ever heard in a game. You assume the role of Robert Cath, a fugitive American with a mysterious background who has come onboard the Express to visit an old friend. You arrive and find your friend has been murdered, but trying to discover the mystery behind his death will not be as simple as it seems. Despite this tired premise, The Last Express never feels like a ""Host Your Own Murder Mystery"" party on a CD. The plot plays out like a cross between The Maltese Falcon and the French classic Pepe Le Moko, and it remains intriguing all the way to the spectacular ending. <P> The only thing that stands in the way of enjoying the story is the gameplay. There are some great innovations in the play mechanics, but they come with a price. The game takes place in real time -characters go about their business - going to dinner, having conversations in the smoking car, and wandering the hallways - according to their own schedules. To pick up valuable info, you have to be in the right place at the right time, but, with a few exceptions, it\'s never a life or death necessity to see or hear everything that\'s going on - which would be impossible anyway. At any given time, there may be people making small talk in the dining car while others discuss the political climate in their private car and still others whisper about their personal lives in hushed tones. The process creates an amazing sense of environment; just wandering up and down the hallways of the train is a fascinating experience. But the real-time device has its price: There are times where literally nothing is going on, and if you\'ve figured out everything you need to do in this particular segment, you simply have to wait for the next big event. Since there\'s no way to make the time pass quickly, this gets a bit frustrating. <P> The Last Express\' biggest shortcoming is that it tries to walk the line between being a traditional adventure game and being something new altogether - and frustratingly ends up being both and neither. It doesn\'t have enough puzzles for a traditional game, making the game zip by in under 20 hours. On the other hand, the puzzles themselves are very traditional, forcing a jarring interruption into the otherwise organic experience. <P> But anyone playing The Last Express will realize almost immediately that the game isn\'t about solving puzzles. It\'s about interacting with characters and enjoying the environment, and it is hugely successful in that department - especially considering the amazing ending, which will justify any frustrations you\'ve had along the way. The graphics are highly stylized, mixing photo-realistic environments with roto-scoped (a process in which actors are filmed and then animated) characters, and the animation follows a strange stop-motion technique. The result is effective, but it takes a little getting used to. The sound is spectacular, combining the excellent voice acting with a gorgeous score. For those who are looking for an enthralling experience rather than a series of unrelated brain-stumpers, The Last Express is highly recommended. -- <i>Ron Dulin</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

You will take the role of a Vault-dweller, a person who has grown up in a secluded, underground survival vault. Circumstances arise that force you to go Outside--to a strange world 80 years after the end of the modern civilization--a world of mutants, radiation, gangs, and violence.', 'Your immediate task is to find a replacement for the broken water purification controller chip. Without that chip, your fellow Vault-dwellers are doomed to dehydration or forced to leave the safety of the Vault for the Outside.', ""The past several years haven't exactly been kind to role-playing game fans. Very few role-playing games have been released since 1993, and those that have made it to retail shelves have largely been unsuccessful at combining playability and originality with the complexity that role-playing game fans love. The release of Blizzard Entertainment's action/role-playing game hybrid Diablo in early 1997 only increased role-playing gamers' anticipation for an equally playable game in a more elaborate, detailed world. After a four-year drought, the wait is over. Fallout is one of the best role-playing games to be released in several years and it succeeds in entertaining gamers by providing a fresh and compelling storyline, good graphics and sound, and attention to those little details that can transform a good game into a great one."", ""Fallout is an unofficial sequel to 1987's Wasteland, one of the most popular role-playing games of all time. While the overwhelming majority of computer role-playing games are set in some pseudo-medieval, Tolkien/AD&amp;D-inspired world of orcs and battleaxes, Fallout is set in the future, several years after an exchange of nuclear weapons has devastated most of the world. Inhabitants who survived did so largely by sheltering themselves in giant underground vaults. Your character's life has been spent entirely within one such vault. A broken chip for your vault's water recycler forces your character to leave the relative safety of the vault to search for a replacement chip aboveground in the wasteland, where you'll encounter struggling communities of survivors, Road Warrior-esque gangs, human mutants, and even stranger creatures. Hardly a typical setting for a role-playing game, but the originality of the setting is one of the strengths of Fallout."", ""Fallout oozes style. Not content with extrapolating a plausible but unexciting hi-tech view of the future, Fallout's design team instead crafted a vision of the future that combines 1950s cold war American culture and early, primitive computer technology (complete with ugly green monochrome screens and an abundance of vacuum tubes), with advanced energy weapons and chemical compounds. Nuka-cola anyone?"", ""Negotiations to allow Fallout to utilize Steve Jackson Games' popular GURPS character system fell apart, but Interplay's replacement character creation system is detailed and thorough. Almost every time a computer game is released that purports to be a role-playing game, a seemingly inevitable onslaught of debate ensues over whether or not that game is, in fact, a role-playing game (as opposed to a member of some presumably inferior wanna-be genre)."", 'Fallout uses a hybrid system of character development, which is both level-based (your character gains character levels by accumulating experience points) and skill-based (your character has 10 primary skill types that can be improved throughout the course of the game). You can also give your character up to two optional traits (such as the ability to see and function better at night), each having both a positive and negative effect on your character. Gore-mongers will want to pick the ""bloody mess"" trait, which causes your victims to die in the most graphically violent way possible. Finally, every time your character gains three character levels you can add a helpful ""perk"" ability to further distinguish your character. Do you want to be a good-natured doctor with a knack for big guns, a nimble gymnast with an addiction, a ruthless assassin, or a lucky thief?', ""Interaction with nonplayer characters (NPCs) is a bit disappointing. Most of the nonplayer characters in Fallout aren't big on conversation and run around blithely and inconsequentially. Shades of the early Ultima games from Richard Garriott and Origin Systems, Stationary NPCs are generally important and will engage in menu-driven conversations. Mobile NPCs, on the other hand, will bark a short message at your character, which will be randomly chosen from three or so available options for that location."", ""Although you only control one character in Fallout, you can convince certain NPCs to join you in your quests, but you'll never be able to directly control their actions. Unfortunately, these NPC companions tend to take particular delight in blocking doorways or shooting you (and each other) in the back with semiautomatic weapons. You also won't be able to directly access your companions' inventory or otherwise instruct them to give you items or to equip better armor. Give an NPC a key item and you'll have to barter or steal from the NPC in order to get it back. Ingrates."", ""The gaming world is presented from an isometric perspective and the graphics are detailed and extremely similar in style and quality to Origin's Crusader games. A sighting bubble, which surrounds your character, ensures that you'll never lose track of objects that would otherwise be obscured as a result of the game's isometric perspective. The settings are suitably apocalyptic and ironic (junked cars are everywhere, but the prevalent mode of transportation is a two-headed cow caravan). Music is also well done throughout the game, with each setting having its own distinct and often haunting melody. Sound effects are less memorable, but adequate."", 'The world moves along in real time until combat is initiated. There is a large variety of weapons to choose from, including pistols, rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, and plasma guns, and each is capable of killing your enemies in a suitably distinct graphical manner. Combat is strictly turn-based and becomes quite tactical, complete with character initiative, action points, and varying attack modes.', ""Although Interplay has recently released a bug-stomping patch, there are still a couple of annoying bugs in Fallout that may force you to backtrack and try certain tasks again. As the excellent and conveniently spiral-bound manual (the Vault Dweller's Survival Guide) suggests, save often. Gameplay is generally delightfully nonlinear, but occasionally the game's chronology gets garbled and quests are presented in an illogical sequence that can result in some inappropriate NPC conversations."", ""Even though these minor flaws bring Fallout's overall rating down a notch or two, Fallout is not only a worthy successor to Wasteland, it's also a role-playing game that is destined to become a classic in its own right. Fallout's detailed graphics, compelling plot, and intuitive gameplay should deservedly broaden its appeal beyond the hard-core role-playing game audience. Put simply, Fallout may be the best role-playing game to be released in years. <i>--Desslock</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

1602 A.D. - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Discover, build, and rule your own new world. The year is 1602, and your future at home is uncertain. On board a ship, a small band of courageous explorers have decided to set sail to begin a new life and seek their fortune in far-off lands. As their leader, you must explore undiscovered coasts, establish new settlements and diplomacy, conduct trade, and sometimes battle to ensure the survival of your new colony.', 'Ever since SimCity virtually invented the god-game genre over ten years ago, gamers have been creating worlds and populating them, and then manipulating the environment to help their charges grow and prosper. Taking its cues from games such as The Settlers, Caesar III, and SimCity, 1602 A.D. combines god-game and real-time-strategy elements to create an interesting blend of real-time and city-building gameplay.', '1602 A.D. is the North American release of a game that came out in Europe last year under the title Anno 1602, which was developed by the German firm Sunflowers. However, despite being essentially the original version of the game with a handful of additions (an included expansion pack, a couple of new building structures, supposedly improved artificial intelligence, and a scenario editor), 1602 A.D. is not just an afterthought release of some obscure European game. In fact, Anno 1602 is the best-selling game ever in Germany and has sold more than a million copies worldwide. As such, you might expect a radical new twist in the gameplay, but 1602 A.D. simply takes the tried-and-true real-time god-game formula and applies a bit of European sensibility. That is, the game is slower, less violent, and more cooperative, yet it still inhabits familiar territory.', ""Despite its historically allusive title, 1602 A.D. is set in a fictitious universe with no direct connection to the colonization of the New World. However, the game has a strong historical flavor, as it opens with the establishment of a small colony on an island that develops much like an early-17th-century town. Adding to the atmosphere is the game's pacing, which is very relaxed. There are several speed settings, but even at faster speeds the game moves along somewhat uneventfully unless you're drastically mismanaging the situation. It's this slow pace that will likely determine whether you like the game or not."", 'The gameplay proceeds along well-worn lines. You\'re charged with building and maintaining a colony on a previously unexplored island. The maps consist of approximately fifteen or twenty islands in a vast ocean, and competing players settle, develop, and expand their holdings in the hope of building a prosperous settlement in the New World. You initially have one ship with enough tools, wood, and food to get a foothold on one island. Once there, you must construct buildings such as fishing huts for food, foresters\' huts for lumber, and various farms for wool and cattle. The objective is to eventually build as large and prosperous a colony as possible, so you\'ll need to build homes for your settlers. As the colony expands, the inhabitants will demand such things as schools and taverns to let them keep growing. Settlers progress through various states of development, up to the highest level of ""aristocrat."" The more advanced the settlers, the more they want. Eventually you\'ll be building cotton and tobacco plantations, churches, colleges, and theaters, as well as shipyards and armories. The relationships between the colonists and their buildings can become rather complex, and managing them efficiently is the point of the game.', '1602 A.D. can be played in several modes, including continuous play, individual scenarios, and multiplayer. Continuous play is the familiar, open-ended mode in which you start with a ship, settle an island, and subsequently develop your colony through various stages to a thriving 18th-century metropolis while protecting yourself from marauding pirates and overly aggressive neighbors. Continuous-play games have no set ending point, and the mode continues essentially until you become tired of the game. On the other hand, scenarios require you to reach a certain goal, such as having a certain number of aristocrats in your colony. -- <i>Bruce Geryk</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver,,['Explore the vast 3D world of Nosgoth'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"['Disc(s) only. Ships in generic case. Disc(s) are professoinally cleaned. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', 'One of the best 3D PlayStation adventure games from last year has now arrived on the Dreamcast. In fact, it\'s an exact port, with graphics that are as impressive on this platform as they were on the original, and with control that\'s almost as tight. But to back up a bit, Crystal Dynamics\' sequel to the first Kain game, Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, is a far different animal from its predecessor. Instead of being a top-down RPG, Soul Reaver is a 3D adventure game similar to Eidos\' Tomb Raider. And Kain? This time he\'s the main antagonist. The game begins hundreds of years after Blood Omen and works on the premise that when you, as Kain, were given the choice of sacrificing yourself to save the world of Nosgoth or ruling it, you chose the latter, plunging the world into darkness. Over the millennia, Kain and his vampiric lieutenants evolved new abilities, with Kain always developing them first and the others soon following. When Raziel, the ""hero"" of the new game, grew wings before his leader did, Kain saw it as blasphemy, tore them from Raziel\'s back, and cast him into a giant, swirling, watery grave. But the long-winded story doesn\'t end there. After his features have been almost completely eaten away by the water, Raziel is saved by a being known as the Elder God, who sets him on a quest to free the world from the parasitic influence of the vampire clans and to destroy Kain. Raziel finds himself transformed so that he no longer drinks blood but devours souls (luckily, since he no longer has a jaw). Also, he can no longer die; instead, he is transported to the Spirit Realm - a shadowy distorted version of the Material World - after sustaining heavy damage. And surprisingly, his wings still work after a fashion, at least letting him glide for short distances. These are the tools you start the game with. You can also move and stack large stone blocks and switch over to the Spirit Realm whenever you like. You can only transport yourself back to the Material World at select locations and only once you\'ve filled up on souls. This ability comes in handy, since the netherworld often bends platforms and structures out of shape so that you can climb them more easily and then flip back to the Material World and continue on. Why not just stay in the Spirit Realm? Because you can\'t open doors or move objects there. You can now begin to see the shape of many of the game\'s inventive 3D puzzles. But that\'s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to your skills. Kain\'s other lieutenants have evolved in different ways throughout the last few hundred years, and each of them acts as a stage boss in the game. One has a spidery form, another has grown a tolerance for water, and so on. After destroying each one, you gain his special ability, which then opens up new areas in the environment for you to access. Beyond that, there are bonus areas (which you don\'t need to complete to beat Soul Reaver). In these areas, you can acquire elemental glyphs, which grant you new powers that work well against the game\'s standard stock of vampires. Speaking of which, there are many different ways to exterminate the vampires of Soul Reaver. You can set them on fire, throw them into water, impale them with stakes, and toss them onto spikes. Destroying vampires regularly is necessary early on in the game because you\'ll eventually revert to the Spirit Realm if you don\'t eat enough souls. That is, until the Soul Reaver itself comes into play. The Soul Reaver is a blade that appears as a thin blue energy trail that curls around your right arm from the shoulder and extends a few feet down past your hand. Swallowing enough souls summons it to the Material World, where it sustains you, keeping you from having to constantly hunt down vampires to feed on. Once you gain the Soul Reaver, you\'ll shatter enemies with an explosive punch that mixes Psylocke\'s psi-dagger (from Marvel Comics\' X-Men) with a Jedi lightsaber. While poking vampires with stakes can get a bit tired after awhile, this never gets old. As this extensive description may suggest, Soul Reaver is a deep game possessed of myriad impressive little touches. The graphics are among the best we\'ve seen on the Dreamcast, taking as much advantage of the power of the system as the original version did of the PlayStation. While it was stunning before, the environments and characters possess a level of clarity and definition far beyond what we saw on the PlayStation Soul Reaver. As before, the game has subtle lighting effects that color each scene just a little differently to the scale and the overall jaw-dropping look of its polygonal 3D world. The Drowned Abbey stage is an excellent example of both elements. Standing midlevel in a half-flooded church, you\'ll look down at water pulsing gently above a tiled floor. When you gaze upward, you\'ll see the reflection of the water shimmering across an ornate gothic ceiling. Meanwhile, Raziel himself is modeled so well that you\'ll find yourself turning the camera around to get a good view of him posing with the Soul Reaver or pulling down his scarf to expose the gaping maw where his mouth used to be. The storyline is presented through a gorgeous introductory CG cinema (which runs even smoother on the Dreamcast), which is then followed by well-crafted events using the in-game engine and superb voice work. It\'s all wonderful high drama, with much less of the overstated breathy gothness found in Blood Omen. An excellent, albeit looping, soundtrack only adds to this and picks up whenever things get intense.  <i>--Joe Fielder </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Galerians,,"['1 Player', 'Memory Card 1 Block', 'Analog Control Compatible', 'Vibration Function Compatible']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Borrowing heavily from Japanese sci-fi animation films like  <i>Akira</i>, <i>Galerians</i> is a survival horror game with a twist. As Rion,  a 14-year-old boy with powerful psychic abilities but no memories, players must  explore a hostile cyberpunk world to unearth clues about Rion's mysterious  past."", ""While gameplay mostly consists of exploration, combat, and puzzle solving,  Rion's powers add an inspired--although somewhat disturbing--gameplay twist. In  order to perform psychic attacks, Rion must inject himself with various  chemicals. However, excessive use of his powers have an adverse effect on his  health, which forces our adolescent junkie to ingest pills to counter the side  effects."", ""Although <i>Galerians</i>'s stylized, computer-generated cut scenes give the  game a cinematic feel, there's an odd sense of discontinuity in this game. This  is mostly caused by an annoying pause that occurs when your character moves  between fixed camera viewpoints. In addition, there is a total lack of  transitional graphics during the disc load times, which occur when Rion is  opening doors and such. <i>--Joe Hon</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b><br />', '', 'A casual skim through most Japanese animated movies or comic fare will unearth characters who can hurl people through walls, make them burst into flames, or cause their heads to explode simply by using the power of their minds. Crave\'s Galerians sees the advent of such empowered folk in a near-future society but with one crucial difference: These people must charge their psychic abilities through the use of injections and pills.  You take on the role of Rion, a 14-year-old boy who wakes up in a hospital shortly after having been part of an experiment that gave him psychic powers but robbed him of his memory. Throughout the rest of this three-disc game you must work through your amnesia and foil the intentions of a group that wishes to change the world for the worse, in addition to staying alive. But maintaining your psychic abilities isn\'t a walk in the park by far. Beyond merely having to find replenished supplies of the drugs that provide you with your mental booms and zaps, you\'re constantly on guard for an episodic short that tends to occur in your brain. Shorts build up over time whether you use your powers or not, but they can be countered through the use of a pill called Delcon. When a short overcomes you, a simple thought from you will cause nearby enemies to explode - a nice enough trick but for the reality that you\'re also unable to travel faster than a forced walk, and your health takes a quick, downward spiral during these episodes.  Beyond using your more showy powers, you can also ""sense,"" which enables you to recall events that had happened in the past within a certain area, or, more practically, it can help you locate objects, such as a key to unlock a door that is right in front of you. The positive side of this is that sensing is a great device for advancing the plot. There are many instances where sensing, say, a hunk of machinery will initiate a CG sequence that helps explain your past. Its drawback is that it lends a very linear ""go here now do this"" sort of feel to the proceedings and makes it very clear that there\'s a great deal of backtracking you need to go through in the game. If there weren\'t so much fetching to be done, Galerians\' pace would be much more upbeat. Otherwise, the game\'s interface and feel should be very familiar, as it mirrors many other games bearing the ""survival horror"" genre name made popular by Capcom\'s Resident Evil series. The backgrounds are made up of rendered stills, and although they\'re very clean, it is sometimes hard to tell which way your character is facing when the camera perspective is pulled way back. Since this happens most often during boss encounters, ""death by camera angle"" can occur. This and the fact that doors sometimes blend in too well with their surroundings are the only real visual gripes. Otherwise, Galerians is a pretty handsome example of what can be done in the later days of the PlayStation. The audio effects and soundtrack mirror this as well.  In terms of how it stands against other games in its genre, Galerians turns out to be more impressive than Jaleco\'s Carrier, but it doesn\'t quite live up to Konami\'s Silent Hill. While hard-core aficionados of the genre should find it entertaining enough, more casual fans would be better off looking to Eidos\' Fear Effect or Capcom\'s Resident Evil 3 Nemesis. The enemy battles and storylines found in those games are more fun, with less to go back and collect before you move forward.   <i>--Joe Fielder </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Marvel Vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['No case, game only.', ""If you've played any of Capcom's 2D fighter CPS2-to-PlayStation conversions lately, then you already know what to expect from the PlayStation version of Marvel vs. Capcom. While the arcade (and, subsequently, the arcade-perfect Dreamcast conversion) supplied a four-fighter tag-team battle, the PlayStation's RAM limitation limits the battle to two fighters. Also, many frames of animation have been chopped out, particularly those for larger characters. Marvel vs. Capcom is the latest incarnation of Capcom's Street Fighter vs. series. But here, instead of limiting the characters to X-Men or Street Fighters, Capcom has taken characters from all over the Marvel and Capcom universes. Marvel is represented by new additions like Venom and Onslaught, as well as fighting-game veterans like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Wolverine. Capcom's lineup includes Street Fighters Ryu, Chun Li, and Zangief, but also nonfighting characters like Captain Commando, Strider Hiryu, and Mega Man. The result is an ultimate (albeit a bit condensed) lineup of fighters from all over the place. This cross section of comic-book heroes and video-game characters gives the game a truly new and diverse feel, even if the gameplay hasn't changed too much since the last Capcom vs. fighting game, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter. Some remnants of the tag battle remain. You still select a second character, but that character's only influence on the battle is in the form of short, special attacks. The arcade game actually had you select three fighters, one of whom served as a helper character that you could call on at any time for a quick attack. Now, you select your main fighter and then choose if you want one of these helpers, or a second normal fighter that will join up with you and perform team super combos, should you issue the command to do so. To make up for the loss of the tag action, the ability to link multiple super combos has been added. This lets you really rack up the multihit combos and do a lot of damage to your opponent, to boot. Graphically, the game really doesn't look too bad, taking into consideration the limitations of the hardware. The game is colorful, and the backgrounds are nice. New to the PlayStation version is a quick zoom that occurs during throws. This is a little disorienting, and the characters get pretty pixelated up close as well. The audio portion of the game is troublesome. Everything sounds extremely tinny, and the trebley sound and music will get on your nerves almost immediately. If you're looking for the arcade version, you really need to go to an arcade or pick up the Dreamcast version. The PlayStation version may have the same moves as the original game, but the shell surrounding those moves is completely different.

Army Men World War,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""War has been declared and it's up to you to lead the Green Army  in a vicious battle against the Tan Army nemesis. Carefully guide your  troops through a deadly barrage of enemy fire in over 15 intense  missions. Track your way through World War II-themed environments,  including beaches, jungles, war-torn cities, and abandoned countryside.  Tons of weapons are at your disposal: call in strategic napalm air  strikes or a swarm of paratroopers, or pierce enemy plastic from a  distance with your sniper rifle. Only the best military minds will  prevail in this blazing battle of ground-based infantry."", ""As if the plastic-soldier carnage in Army Men 3D weren't enough, 3DO is back in an even more over-the-top sequel in Army Men World War. The plot of the first Army Men is similar to this game's - the Tan army is on the warpath, and it's up to a lone Green-army soldier to defeat it. Unfortunately for you though, you happen to be that soldier. Sure, you're told you're getting backup, but that never really happens in this type of game. After an initial cinematic, the game quickly launches you into the meat of the conflict. You find yourself on an enemy beach, charged with the task of taking a Tan encampment's radio communications. Succeed in this mission, and you'll progress up the beach, through the jungle, and into the heart of Tan-army territory. Armed with only a rifle, a bayonet, binoculars, and unlimited bullets, you face 16 frenetic battles. Initially, the controls seem simple enough. Use the directional pad to move, press X to shoot, use R1 to zoom in, and use the triangle and square buttons to cycle through weapons. Unfortunately, sluggish response coupled with restrictive environments quickly unravels this simplicity. The time between tapping a direction and moving is too great, and it's far too easy to get stuck behind even the smallest of objects. When the heat's on and you're surrounded by five or six enemy soldiers, the tasks of aiming, switching weapons, and attacking become a frustrating mess of tangled fingers. Besides control issues, progressing through Army Men World War's levels is akin to playing Tomb Raider, without the requisite cliffs, caves, and crevasses. Each mission's goals are distinctly spelled out, and a comprehensive terrain map ensures you'll never become lost. Within each level, you can also acquire grenades, explosives, mortars, bazookas, and a variety of other war-waging tools. Helping to lift the game out of its cookie-cutter status, some missions also require a bit of strategy to complete - for example, avoiding enemy contact or finding the best route for outrunning a fleeing jeep. While it's no 3D war sim, and the experience is entirely too linear, Army Men World War is at least a bit more diverse in the gameplay department than previous Army Men titles. Furthermore, melting enemy soldiers with the flamethrower can provide countless hours of sadistic enjoyment. Although the negative effects of hit-and-miss controls on gameplay is common these days, rarely do a game's graphics have such a detrimental effect on gameplay. However, in Army Men World War's case, that's exactly the problem. Given, the toy soldiers' character models are both amusing and decently detailed. Given, the jungle backdrops and scenery are ample enough to exhibit realism. And yes, the interstitial Plastic Toy News snippets between battles are gleefully amusing. These are all positive aspects, one must concede. However, everything is too freakin' dark! If it were only the realistic shading of the dense-jungle environments, things wouldn't be so bad. However, the entire game's visibility level is one of dark, darker, and darkest. Maybe it's the required use of dark greens, olive drabs, and earthy brown colors, coupled with an overuse of black. Maybe it's the fact that small tan soldiers hiding in brownish areas are near undetectable. Regardless, even if you crank your television's brightness and contrast up about 20 ticks, the game's still too dark. Furthermore, if you do this, then you'll begin to notice the game's texture warping, so either way you lose. What you end up with is an average-looking game brought down by overall light level - ouch. Although there are problems with the plot, gameplay, and the graphics, Army Men World War does excel in one area - sound. Gunshots are both loud and alarming, tearing through plastic soldiers as if they were Mars bars on the receiving end of a George Foreman binge. The sound of explosives is particularly impressive, giving one the urge to overuse these devices. The utterances the enemy soldiers make when walking, grunting, and leaping are also a delight to the ears. Furthermore, the background music is adequately varied, and it is majestic and awe-inspiring in that way that only war anthems can be. Frankly, not since the Guns of Navarone have the sounds of war been this good.  What you get with Army Men World War is a decent sequel to the original Army Men 3D, but one that's only barely superior. There's decent variety in levels, the two player flag mode is fun, and the reward value for completing the game is high, but the game's overall replay value is simply drawn through the mire by inadequate control, murky graphics, and cookie-cutter plot. Had more time been spent on the game's graphics and gameplay, Army Men World War might have turned out to be more than just a good premise wrapped in an average game.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

"Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour (Playstation, 2000)",,['rated EVERYONE'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Experience the thrill of WALT DISNEY WORLD Quest Magical Racing Tour and find all the missing pieces ot th efireworks Machine, race against the clock multiplayer action', ""Though the name may be quite a mouthful, Walt Disney World Quest Magical Racing Tour is a wonderful lighthearted cart-racing game that fans of the genre will surely enjoy. Followers of the world of Disney will also undoubtedly be attracted to the game levels, which are modeled after many of the popular attractions at Walt Disney World. Either way, it's hard to go wrong with WDWQMRT. The story behind the game is that Chip and Dale have accidentally clogged up the Magic Kingdom's fireworks machine with a few accidentally placed acorns. The machine then went haywire and exploded, sending pieces of the machine to nearly every location of the park. It's up to you to race with everyone else in the park and collect pieces of the machine so it can be put back together.  You can select from a variety of Disney characters such as Chip and Dale, Moe Whiplash, Bruno Biggs, Otto Plugnut, Polly Roger, and Baron Karlott - just to name a few. The game does have a few other characters that are hidden and that can be unlocked by completing the game. Playing as the Disney character is a lot of fun, but the real treat is exploring the levels you get to race through. All 13 of the game's levels are modeled after the popular rides and attractions within the Magic Kingdom, such as Big Thunder Mountain, the Haunted Mansion, and the Pirates of the Caribbean. Each level is altered so that you can race in and through different parts of the attraction. In addition, most of the levels have specific vehicles that fit the theme of the attraction. For instance, when you reach the Space Mountain track all of the racers pilot little one-man hover/rocket ships. The different vehicles really don't control all that differently, but they add a bit of verity and style.  The gameplay of Disney's Magical Racing Tour is straightforward, fun, and involving. It has the typical cart-racing game setup where you race laps around a track and pick up items like teacups and acorns, which you can launch at your opponents. Controlling the carts is very easy - all you really do is steer, accelerate, and break. The only real strategy in the game comes into play when you are trying to take shortcuts or when you are using items. Visually, Magical Racing Tour is very nice. The game moves at a brisk pace and provides a wonderful sense of speed. Moreover, the levels never really pop up in front of you - the point at which the level is drawn in is always far out of view. All of the characters are very detailed and articulated, as are the various vehicles they pilot through the levels. The levels themselves are awesome; when racing, you find yourself being distracted by objects and characters that you've seen before throughout the game.  In the audio department, Magical Racing Tour does a great job of re-creating the experience of visiting the park. The game's opening and menu screens are accompanied by the infamous It's a Small World ditty, which gets under your skin just as fast as it does in real life. Each of the levels has the specific music and sound effects that you'd hear if you were actually at the park on the ride. During the Pirates of the Caribbean level, you can hear the individual animatronic characters speaking the lines that have made the ride such a favorite.  Disney's Magical Racing Tour on the surface may just seem like another Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing clone, and once you spend any amount of time with the game you'll realize that, at its core, it truly is one. However, with its awesome levels, characters, vehicles, shortcuts, items, overall presentation, and gameplay, Magical Racing Tour has more than enough style - and it offers a different enough experience - to make the game worthwhile. In addition, those that love the world of Disney will find the game to be a surprising treat that is wonderfully fun, not only for its content but also for its gameplay.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

With this sudden deployment of numerous titles, all featuring their own cute characters in go-karts, power-ups, and extremely similar gameplay, it's been hard to keep tabs on which one has the most going for it. While Crash Team Racing is certainly one of the best of the genre, Speed Punks, Sony's latest kart racer, easily stacks up with the best. Actually, Speed Punks was originally released last August in Europe under the name Speed Freaks. The game was surprisingly successful - to the point where a special limited edition of the game was released packed with a multitap, making four-player games possible. Even though the game is almost a year old by technical calculations, it is still quite impressive in many areas. One area definitely worthy of praise is the game's physics. The vehicles move, bounce, and steer in a very lively way. You really have to pay attention to just how far you push the analog stick because if you get careless you'll end up smashing into a wall and losing precious time. That's not to say the game is hard to play - it's just not as forgiving as some of the other kart racers such as Walt Disney World's Magical Racing Quest. In Speed Punks, you still have to follow the standard formula of racing around tracks, collecting power-ups, and lining up for speed boosters, but at least it's a little more of a challenge since the physics really make it a bit more of an involved controller process to power slide, land a big jump, and line up for items. Items, tracks, and the other typical kart elements are all packed into Speed Freaks. The game simplifies the whole power-up system by making the items you get more practical and less wacky. There are two types of power-ups you can pick up over the twelve courses - items that make you go faster or items that let you shoot the other racers. The weapons in the game, such as heat-seeking missiles and machine guns, are self-explanatory. While the weapons sound ominous and destructive, the resulting effect is still as harmless as the nonlethal stopping power of one Mario Kart's turtle shells, fitting in with the cartoon nature of the game. Visually, Speed Punks is very nice. The tracks and racers look incredibly sharp even though the racers are composed of very simple, low-poly models. The game features a lot of cool lighting effects that give the game a very polished look and make the heat-seeking-missile explosions look really cool. Most impressive is the game's superfast and consistent frame rate that even holds true when there are four players playing. All that, and the game doesn't even have any pop-up.  In the end, Speed Punks is a quality go-kart racing game that offers more than enough variety to warrant yet another kart-racing game purchase. The game's modes of play (tournament, challenge, time attack, and multiplayer) offer a great deal of options that carry the game a lot further than most of the other games in the genre. If you're a fan of Crash Team Racing and have been looking for another fun four-player racer, or if have wondered if any of these kart games are any fun, Speed Punks won't lead you astray.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Fleet Command - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""The world's mightiest arsenals are under your complete control in <i>Jane's Fleet Command,</i> the most realistic naval strategy simulation ever created. You give the orders and the entire battle group--fast frigates, Aegis guided-missile cruisers, nuclear submarines, nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and each plane on them--follows your command. A combat direction screen allows you to survey the whole operation, while a 3-D screen allows you to zoom in close and follow the action in real time. Designed under a partnership between Jane's Combat Simulations and the experts at Sonalysts--the same people who develop training software for the U.S. Navy--<i>Jane's Fleet Command</i> is truly the definitive naval strategy game."", 'Naval warfare simulations are a daunting prospect for most gamers. Images of inch-thick manuals and esoteric strategies have kept this niche limited to the two Harpoon games and a few other titles. Sonalysts, creator of the 688(i) submarine sim, has taken on this vast and complex subject matter with a graphical flourish and a determination to render the complex nuances of modern naval warfare fun and accessible. Aside from a few interface and control glitches, it has succeeded admirably.', 'Fleet Command takes the Harpoon model of real-time naval combat, strips it to the bone, and wraps it in a simple and visually dynamic package without sacrificing the core sense of depth and realism. Missions run the gamut of modern naval actions: massive carrier operations, smaller patrol-boat encounters, escort, transit, land strikes, and so on. Almost 40 single missions are offered, each with a difficulty rating of one to four stars. A four-part globe-spanning campaign game utilizes many of the more difficult single missions, tying them together in a scripted campaign with persistent losses and damage. Each mission has set goals and victory requirements, with varying degrees of success depending upon accomplishing the mission, keeping your own ships from being damaged, and avoiding collateral civilian casualties. The seas are full of unidentified contacts, some friendly, some enemy, some neutral. Picking your way through this target-rich environment to find and target the key assets of the enemy while protecting your own fleet is the core of the game.', 'Gameplay is handled on one screen with a mix of maps and real-time hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. A large main window can display either a zoomable map of the scenario or a moveable camera view of any object in the current mission. Below this are three smaller windows. One has a thumbnail overview of the entire region, another has detailed information (such as speed, heading, weapons loadout, and damage) on the currently selected weapon platform, and a third may be swapped with the main window to show either the map or the 3D camera view.', 'All commands are handled from this simple and elegant screen layout. Using a combination of mouse and hotkeys you can give orders to any ship, aircraft, or submarine under your control. Some orders are simple mouse-driven commands, such as move to a location, identify an unidentified target, and destroy an enemy target. Using pop-up menus and hotkeys, you can also give more precise commands. Antisubmarine teams can be given patrol boxes to search for threats. Individual weapons can be selected from a menu, allowing you to order an aircraft to close use its AIM-9s rather than its AIM-120s. Subs can be ordered to submerge and surface at intervals, placing them out of radio contact while they execute their orders. Some important commands, however, have been assigned to hotkeys only and can be hard to manage. Speed and altitude, for instance, may be set to low, medium, or high settings, but the info box never tells you what the current order is, and any subsequent command (such as a change in direction) cancels the last speed and/or altitude order and forces the unit to go to its default setting. This is awkward.', ""Other interface quirks and problems keep Fleet Command from sailing smoothly. Some of the huge encounters can involve hundreds of assets once you get all your aircraft launched, yet there are only ten slots for storing groups, which is woefully insufficient. This means you can't effectively create flight formations. Aircraft assigned to take out a target may wind up flying at different speeds and altitudes. You also can't give complex group orders - only transit, attack, and identify. If you want every unit to attack with a particular weapon, you have to select and change each individually. Sensors are a major headache to control. There is a vaguely described global EMCON setting that turns some sensors on or off for everyone. But not every sensor can be activated, and it's hard to figure out just which sensors are going hot. Some sensors aren't controlled by global settings at all: If you want them on, you have to select and activate each ship's and plane's sensors individually, sometimes four per ship. Since EMCON is one of the most essential elements in naval strategy, this is a poor solution."", ""It's a shame that control is so iffy in Fleet Command, since the missions are quite good and entertaining. The graphics are finely detailed and provide an exciting window to the unfolding action. With a mission editor and good online support, there is also plenty of gameplay value. AI is generally very good for enemies and adequate for friendlies, though I do wish pilots would take more aggressive evasive actions when being attacked. The many strong points tilt the scale in Fleet Command's favor and overcome many of its interface problems. Once you get used to the flaky controls, there is a lot to like here. <i>--Chet Thomas</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Probably not too many, but more than a few know the names of his games, namely, Sega Rally and Sega Rally 2. Now that his hallowed AM3 is nothing more than legend, Mizuguchi has gone on to spearhead Sega Soft R&D Dept. 9, and the fruits of the group\'s first labor is the future retro-techno dancing game Space Channel 5. A dancing game? Yes, and what a dancing game it is. Designed by former members of Team Andromeda (Panzer Dragoon) and Sonic Team (Sonic Adventure, natch), Space Channel 5  is a fresh experience for all programmers involved, and it shows. Energetic and up-tempo, SC5 evokes comparisons to Parappa the Rapper and Bust-A-Groove, the progenitors of the dancing-game genre. Despite the clones that these games have spawned, it takes more than some polygonal puppets and a beat to make a keeper. Um Jammer Lammy followed and failed to fully ignite the masses, and Dance Dance Revolution is a Twister-like aerobic excursion that goes off on its own unique path. So where does that leave Space Channel 5?  Somewhere deep in space is a funky race of aliens called Morolians, who have watched the planet Earth from afar and have decided to take control of the masses with their hypnotic disco dancing. Ulala, the sprightly orange-clad heroine of the game, is covering the situation as an on-scene reporter for the television network Space Channel 5. As she encounters each band of Morolians whisking away more and more humans, Ulala finds herself attempting to outdance the Morolians and recapture the bewildered natives The game\'s controls consist of the digital directional pad, plus the A and B buttons for shooting.  Combat entails mimicking the Morolians\' moves (for example, up, down, up, down, shoot, shoot, shoot). You must duplicate their moves, a la Simon Says, to defeat the current band of Morolians and liberate whatever humans they might have under their sway. In addition to replicating the Morolians\' moves, you must also hit the right ""shoot"" button, with the A button set to whack aliens and the B button set to liberate humans. This can tax even the most nimble of fingers when the going gets rough. However, the better you do, the more people you add to your posse. While Ulala starts off solo, by the end of a level she may have a dozen people following her, all choreographed to her every move like a Janet Jackson video. Accordingly, as you progress through the game, the rhythmic challenges increase in difficulty. It will be awhile before you meet the special guest found toward the end of Space Channel 5. When you encounter the bosses in the game, you have a limited number of mistakes you can make before your game is over. Survive the encounter and you get to move on to the next stage. The greater your success,  the higher the number of people watching Space Channel 5 will be, making your ratings percentage higher. This is the key to victory in the game. Graphically, the game is an astounding blend of animated CG backgrounds and beautifully rendered polygonal characters. A bad comparison would be to imagine Resident Evil\'s backgrounds, but moving constantly, like a movie, with the 3D characters doing their duty while superimposed on the backgrounds. The effect, considering the Dreamcast\'s power, is awesome. Even with more than a dozen onscreen characters all dancing together, the game still runs at 60 frames per second, although slowdown occurs during the most crowded moments. What really separates the already gorgeous graphics of Space Channel 5 from those of other games is the overall top-notch graphic design. Taking cues from \'60s future-rama, the game boasts some of the most stellar graphic design seen since Designer\'s Republic worked on Wipeout XL. Designer\'s Republic has since slacked off, but Space Channel 5 is there to pick up the design torch. The in-game graphics are a blend of \'60s psychedelia mixed with a retro view of a futuristic world, which is most obviously exhibited in the space-station design and Ulala\'s own ever-changing wardrobe. More woman than Lara Croft will ever be, Ulala mixes a consistently orange ensemble of miniskirts, hot pants, halter tops, and flares with the occasional blue garter belt thrown in for good measure. Her clothes all feature the most effective use of specular highlighting this side of Gran Turismo and never display any polygon seaming or breakup. Space Channel 5\'s characters all feature a responsive mix of motion-captured movements combined with hand-animated routines for a less robotic, more organic experience. The game does have a couple of downsides, however. The hardest part about the game can be how the tempo can fluctuate wildly, with little to no warning. While some patterns may be based on a 4/4 tempo, the game will often switch to a 2/4 beat that you will have to learn by trial and error, much as you would in an R-Types shooter. There are definitely patterns here that will not be beaten without repeated attempts. Secondly, there are timing issues that only the swiftest will conquer first time up. While the D-pad entries are usually pretty forgiving, the moments when you must enter a shoot command are when the game\'s timing can be tough. If you try to press the shoot button when you think you should, you\'ll probably blow the attempt. Most of the time you\'ll need to press the button just before you normally would. The other main gaffe in the game is the lack of a two-player (or even four-player) mode. While Ulala is a sexy little vixen, it would be nice to assume the role of one of the other personalities in the game and take each other on in some sort of competition. The gaming interface is so easy to grasp and so intuitive that Sega could have done a Point Blank or Chu-Chu Rocket with the game and included some kind of challenge mode or minigame selection. Even a head-to-head mode in which you and another player could try to score the highest by following some predetermined beat would have been cool. As it is, at least the main character is alluring enough to watch through repeated plays as you try to unlock every other character to view in the character-profile mode. Unfortunately, the game is short, clocking in at four meager levels. Although the replay factor is not that bad - with higher scores rewarding you with secret characters to view and whatnot - four levels is still pretty short, and an American version would benefit from more stages. The sound is obviously one of the most strongly scrutinized features, since this game centers on dancing. Mizuguchi is notorious for his love of techno, and there\'s plenty of fast-paced techno-house music here. Sometimes this almost borders on drum \'n\' bass and jazz when the tempo goes crazy. Interestingly, an old Mexican musician composed the theme song back in 1965, and yet it still sounds current, much in the way the James Bond theme always sounds cool. The vocal samples can get fairly annoying at times, and you\'ll likely either love or hate them. Provided you can bear the aliens\' voices, you\'ll get to experience one of the most refreshing games that has come along in a good while. While not particularly groundbreaking, Space Channel 5 offers a shallow yet high-quality experience, with a glossy production level second to none.  <I>--James Mielke </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

In a convergence of role-playing, fighting, and adventure elements, you play as Ryo, a young man who's come home to witness his father being fatally beaten by thugs. This event immediately sparks in him a quest for both revenge and an investigation into the mysterious jade amulet the thugs stole. You'll have to play detective to gather clues, such as possible motivations and whereabouts, from nonplaying characters. Not all of the people you question will be happy about you nosing around, so be prepared to fight and keep fighting. You'll need money for the quest, and there's plenty of minigame-style ways to get it--from forklift driving to casino gambling."", 'The game features vibrant 3-D graphics, which are nearly photo-realistic in their astounding attention to even subtle detail. For example, the sky background changes slowly to denote the passing daylight.', ""To say that <I>Shenmue</I> is an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?"", 'The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fu <I>sensei</I>, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.', ""<I>Shenmue</I>'s Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there."", ""Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges from  <I>Dragon's Lair</I>-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends.

Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles,,"['Complete, includes disc, case, cover art, manuals and inserts.']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Take back the Theed Royal Palace in this fast and furious lightsaber  action game. You will have the power of the Force and your trusty Jedi saber to  help you ward off legions of battle droids, destroyer droids, assassins, and  other creatures from the <i>Star Wars: Episode I</i> worlds. Your connection to  the Force grows with each battle, which adds much-needed power boosts, new  moves, and enhanced Jedi abilities for your journeys within the various worlds.  Choose to fight as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, or Jedi Council members Mace  Windu, Plo Koon, or Adi Gallia.', 'LucasArts\' track record with console games is a fairly rough one, especially considering that the company treats PC gamers pretty well. For every good Rogue Squadron and Episode 1 Racer, there\'s been an inferior Phantom Menace and Masters of Teras Kasi, while excellent titles like Grim Fandango and X-Wing Alliance remain PC-only. And LucasArts\' latest offering, Star Wars: Episode I Jedi Power Battles for the PlayStation, unfortunately does nothing to improve the company\'s ""TV game"" reputation. In this game, you choose from one of five Episode I-era Jedi to run, jump, slash, and use the Force with through the game\'s ten levels. Each Jedi has his or her own Force powers and special items. For instance, Obi-Wan Kenobi has a forward dash-and-slash move and uses thermal detonators, while his teacher Qui-Gon Jinn produces a Force shock wave and tosses around pulse grenades. No matter which character you control though, you play through the film\'s plot as if you were Obi-Wan or Qui-Gon, from the scene where the trade council tries to poison them to the final battle with the notorious evil Jedi Darth Maul. The gameplay is a refined version of that found in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. You use your lightsaber to carve up droids, deflect blaster shots, and jump to and from the occasional platform. In a tip of the hat to Legend of Zelda, you can lock your sights on the nearest enemy with a touch of the R1 shoulder button, although the system lacks Zelda\'s finesse. The fighting is clearly the best Power Battles feature. Once you get used to the control scheme and the many different functions, slicing up robots and dodging shots can be fairly entertaining. And the fact that the developers thought to include the option to play through the game with a friend is another bright spot.  But there are many points in Power Battles in which you\'ll die unnecessarily because of a bad camera angle, even when you\'re just simply walking around. Trying to pull off a platform jump is another matter entirely - one that in function is much more difficult and vexing than it\'s likely meant to be. Slashing your way through a few dozen enemy droids only to get killed because it\'s hard to tell how far away a catwalk is can be very frustrating. Beyond that, sometimes the perspective doesn\'t work well enough to reveal where you need to go next, hiding areas you have to leap to, by showing them to you straight on or full front so you can\'t see them. The levels are also quite long with few continues and no midstage save points (checkpoints only), meaning that you can be doing fine, then miss a jump and end up having a lot of backtracking to do.   Though not as ill-conceived or as badly carried out as its Episode I adventure-game kin, Jedi Power Battles still has enough problems to warrant it a game to be avoided. To paraphrase the Weeping Gorilla from Alan Moore\'s Top Ten comic series, maybe we just expect too much from LucasArts.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

The Dreamcast's graphics abilities allow for finely detailed 3-D models of the players and stadiums as well as realistic weather and lighting effects.

Hidden throughout 25 levels are four treasure chests and five music boxes--once he's found them, he's free. Naturally, Wario must contend with plenty of obstacles, puzzles and truly bizarre foes before settling into his favorite chair back home. In a cool twist, certain foes and power-ups transform Wario into the oddest of configurations that help or hinder his progress through the levels. Fire-loving critters, for instance, will set Wario's pants on fire, sending him on a mad dash to some remote part of the level. A specific power-up flattens Wario like an unlucky Looney Tunes character. In this game, though, a flat Wario is a lucky Wario, as he can squeeze into new areas. The Japanese import version of this game released to much acclaim, so consider this release a good bet as a very replayable addition to your Game Boy pak library."", ""The <i>Wario Land</i> series stands as one of the most innovative on the Game Boy Color, and with each new release we are left wondering how Nintendo is going to top itself with subsequent releases.

Wario can't die, but the various creatures in the game can transform him temporarily into an alternate form. Get hit by a zombie, and you turn into a zombie until you are healed by light from a street lamp. Let the mad professor hit you with his potion and you become invisible, meaning security cameras can't see you, but you also can't see yourself to make precision jumps. Each alternate form has a specific strength and weakness, and figuring out how to use the transformations to solve puzzles is half of the game's fun.

Now Dart, a young warrior, is on a quest to find the demon that killed his parents.', ""<i>The Legend of Dragoon</i> features prerendered, 3-D backgrounds and detailed, polygonal figures.

The Spirit Points you accumulate during your quest can be used to unlock a special power, known as the Dragon attack."", ""Talk about going out with a bang! Sony Computer Entertainment released  its four-disc <i>The Legend of Dragoon</i> for the PlayStation only months  before the release of that console's successor, the PlayStation2.

The two join forces with a knight who is  trying to end a war that's destroying the region. Dart soon learns that he is a  Dragoon--a human who's privy to the spiritual power of dragons.

It\'s hard to sustain a  player through this kind of time span, but <i>The Legend of Dragoon</i> takes  chances and wins. For example, its battle system is turn based, so you can  actually use some strategy, but it also features special ""additions,"" or  fighting combos that unfold if you match the X button to that addition\'s timing.  When handling three players\' additions, each with unique sequences, it can be  quite challenging.

Also, the perspectives often  change between battles--players will direct the action from behind the heroes,  behind the villains, looking down from above, and off to the side.', ""There are a couple downsides to the game. First, the stylized transitions into  and out of battle mode, while initially cool, quickly become  exhausting--especially when running the gauntlet through lesser foes in the wilderness or  lower ramparts of a castle. The game's story is built such that you're watching  the sometimes goofy dialog as a spectator rather than participating in it. There  are a few occasions when the game will prompt you to choose from two different  responses, but often either response will bring about the same conclusion. That  tightly controlled narrative, however, often works in the player's favor by  keeping the game flowing instead of the wandering common in other RPGs, where  players waste time looking to each townsperson for direction."", ""Overall, the game's wonderfully illustrated sets, light exploration and problem  solving, and a handful of jaw-dropping full-motion video scenes make <i>The  Legend of Dragoon</i> fun to play and hard to put down. <i>--Porter Hall</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b>', '']",Sony Computer Entertainment,"['>#9,344 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#49 in Video Games &gt; More Systems &gt; PlayStation &gt; Games']",$152.85,Video Games,B00004S9AF

It was created by the developers of the original Twisted Metal and Twisted Metal 2: World Tour and even uses an optimized version of their old code. Meanwhile, Sony\'s 989 Studios (who ended up with rights to the series\' name) is working on the third TM game, which no one has seen running yet at the time of this writing. The name of the game is still driving and shooting, but this time there\'s more at work than just blowing up all the other vehicles. The story has you as an automercenary, hijacking tourists into the high-profile vacation spots of the future and showing them the sights. There\'s only one tourist per level and everyone vies for him. Thus, conflict arises. If you can pick the tourist up and get him to the designated photo spots, you\'ll get cash to buy health, weapon power-ups, and extra lives. Taking a page from SingleTrac\'s last game, Critical Depth, there are weapons that cause other vehicles to eject their tourist. They\'re fairly scarce though, which leads to tons of wacky situations where you\'re trying to ram or blast an enemy away from a photo-op spot, while screaming, ""No! No! No!"" The graphics are improved over Twisted Metal 2, and the levels now have varied hilly terrain (which takes almost as much as it gives, since this feature makes it hard to see around in the split-screen multiplayer modes), unlike TM2, which was pretty flat. The bosses are nowhere near as terrifying, and save for the final one, seem almost like any other standard opponent. There\'s some other crucial element missing as well, and perhaps it\'s that the look, feel, and character design of the TM series is so incredibly iconic, that anything that copies it comes off like an imperfect Bizarro-style duplicate.  But what the game Rogue Trip should truly be compared to is the current holder of the auto-combat crown, Activision\'s Vigilante 8. While Rogue Trip has far more levels and is much tougher, V8 nudges the title out in the categories of graphics (it\'s almost a toss-up here), level design, and gameplay. Vigilante 8 still feels pretty fresh, while RT is a reworked theme. That said, there\'s still a lot of fun to be had here, and fans of any driving shooter will enjoy it, but those expecting as big of a leap as we saw from Twisted Metal to Twisted Metal 2 are going to feel Rogue Trip falls somewhat short.  <i>--Steven Garrett </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Pocket Fighter | PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""OK, let's see if I can explain this without losing my mind. Capcom took characters from its various fighting games and put them in a puzzle game, called Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo. The game was, at its core, a Puyo Puyo clone, except little super deformed versions of the Street Fighters fought it out in the middle of the screen. This was done purely for effect, as their fighting didn't really impact the gameplay at all. Now, Capcom has taken the midget fighters out of the puzzle game and put them back into a fighting game. The gems from Puzzle Fighter show up, as well. The result is a fighting game that is so sickeningly basic and painstakingly derivative that even Capcom diehards should stay away. <P>The familiar six-button fighting game control has been ditched in favor of a three-button system. One button punches, one kicks, and one does a special, unblockable attack. The game's special moves are powered by the gems from Puzzle Fighter, which fly everywhere on every hit. Special moves have three levels, depending on how many gems you have. For instance, a level one fireball will only hit once, but a level three will hit three times and set your enemy on fire. Along with picking up gems, you can also pick up small globes. There are fire globes, ice globes, stone globes, and more. Tossing these globes at your opponents will either hurt or stun them, depending on which globe you have. <P>The graphics are well done, although the style of the artwork is open to debate. Do we really want goofy-looking squashed fighters? Do we really want combos that cause the characters to change outfits? Do we mind that the costume combos are much more apparent on the female characters? Are those two fighters really smoking opium in that igloo? Who exactly is Capcom making this game for? Sick fighting game fantasies aside, the characters and backgrounds look nice and animate well. The backgrounds contain a good number of characters from the Street Fighter universe. In one scene, you'll see Dee Jay tending bar, Honda ordering a drink, and Guile and Charlie yakking it up at a back table. The music fits the game, consisting mostly of happier remixes of existing tunes from other Capcom fighters. <P>The game also contains a create-a-fighter mode. The game asks you a lot of different questions and gives you a character based on your tastes. You then send this character into battle, where it earns cards for winning fights. While it may sound a bit like Monster Rancher, it's far too basic to be interesting. <P>Capcom made the fighting genre what it is today, but this game is yet another blemish on Capcom's rapidly declining record. If you really feel the need to see Chun-Li dressed up as a cheerleader, then this game is right up your alley. But then, perhaps a psychiatric evaluation would be time better spent. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

GREAT FOR GAMERS AND COLLECTORS. VERY RARE COMPLETE SET VERSION. AWESOME DEAL.\n\nSuper Off Road, also known as Ivan Stewart's Super Off Road, is an arcade video game released in 1989 by The Leland Corporation. Virgin Games produced several home versions in 1990. In 1991, an NES version was later released by Leland's Tradewest subsidiary followed by versions for most major home formats, including Super NES, Amiga and MS-DOS.\n\nIn the game, up to 3 players (4 in the NES version through use of either the NES Satellite or NES Four Score) compete against each other or the computer in racing around several top-view indoor off-road truck tracks of increasing difficulty. Good results earn the player points to continue in the championship and money with which to upgrade their truck or buy more nitro boosters. The goal is to reach the end of the season with the most money earned. Continues are available but whereas players can get extra money in the arcade version, in the home versions, the player's money is reset to 0. This is one of the first games where the player could upgrade his or her vehicle by earning points or money (although in Atari Games' Sprint series, one could upgrade their racer using wrenches), a system that is used in most arcade-style racing games today.\n\nThe track pack was an add-on board for arcade units that contains eight brand-new tracks: Shortcut, Cutoff Pass, Pig Bog, Rio Trio, Leapin' Lizards, Redoubt About, Boulder Hill and Volcano Valley. It also gave the brand new ability to choose between either the normal truck or the dune buggy; both vehicles had different characteristics accordingly and added a new element to the game.""]","by

Marvel Vs. Capcom 2,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast']",{},"[""For decades, kids have absurdly pondered the hypothetical matchups of superheroes. In that spirit, Capcom, home to some intense, street-fighting martial artists, has created a venue for its characters to challenge the superheroes of Marvel Comics in the aptly titled <i>Marvel vs. Capcom</i> series. In this second installment, the furious, action-filled fighter now features 3-D sets behind its 2-D heroes and allows you to build a tag team of three fighters. If you've got the right touch, you'll be able to link all three of your fighters' supercombos together in a devastating chain reaction."", ""Just when it seems 3-D fighting games have permanently made 2-D fighting  games obsolete, something like <i>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</i> comes along and proves  just how deep and fun 2-D fighters can be.

Beginning with favorites such as Spider Man, Wolverine,  Ryu, and Chun Li, players can eventually unlock 56 characters. We had our hands  full just mastering a few of these fighters, and getting familiar with all 56  would take months of intense practice. There are almost too many moves, all  depicted with superb animation and augmented by several tag-team combos. When  the match begins, you can pick three characters. Once things heat up, you can  call in your pals to unleash a massive move on your opponent. This adds  immensely to the game's depth, and button mashers will be in for a shock when  they find that their mistimed tag-team moves backfire."", ""Visually, this game is intense.

Street Fighter Ex 2 Plus,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Street Fighter EX2 Plus is the follow-up to Street Fighter EX Plus Alpha. Both games eschew the 2D style we've come to know from the Street Fighter series in favor of a polygonal approach, but the gameplay hasn't entered the third dimension whatsoever. While EX2 Plus adds a few features and some new characters to the mix, it doesn't really have the overall flair that made the first game stand out. In addition to old favorites like Guile, Ken, and Chun Li and returning EX fighters such as Pullum, Darun and D.Dark, new fighters like Nanase, Area, and Vulcano Rosso have entered the fold. The new characters fit well into the EX universe and exhibit the game's altered form of Street Fighter magic. The gameplay is standard six-button Street Fighter. Everything from fireballs to dragon punches to spinning pile drivers have been implemented in polygonal form, and the timing of the moves haven't really changed, so moving from EX to EX2 or even from 2D to 3D isn't much of a change. The real differences in the EX series lie in its use of the super meter. In addition to the super cancels and guard cancels introduced in the first EX, there's a new excel move, which acts much like the custom combos from Street Fighter Alpha 2. While it's neat to watch, the standard super combos are usually a more effective use of one third of your super meter. Graphically, EX2 has a more smoothed-over look than the first EX did. While it does look a bit better than EX did, some players will likely miss the jagged-yet-defined look of EX. The effects have been bumped up a notch or two, and super combos really explode off the screen as a result. The super combo finish is still every bit as insane as in the original, this time showing all sorts of meteorites streaking toward the earth. The music is a little generic, and you won't find any old Street Fighter favorites among the various tracks. The character voices are still reasonably good. A static screen and a few lines of text, however, have replaced the endings, a definite downgrade when compared with the animated endings in the original game. The usual modes are here, including versus, the barrel bonus stage, and of course, the expert mode. The expert mode gives you 16 different combo challenges per character. The first few are simple things, like throwing a fireball. But near the end of each character's list lie some pretty difficult six- or seven-hit combos. These combos are all listed in Japanese, so importers be ready to spend some time staring at the command list to figure out which move the game is referring to. Overall, EX2 is more of an upgrade to the original game than it is an entirely new experience. It looks very good and plays well, but it doesn't add enough new features to interest anyone that has become bored with the original. If you're still interested in EX and you're looking for something to tide you over until EX3 comes out for the PlayStation2, EX2 just might do the trick, but don't expect the originality and freshness that the first game provided.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Later, go on to solve puzzles and work with others to accomplish your goals. The game features beautifully detailed seascapes, with creatures and plants that look and move realistically."", ""Ecco the dolphin has always played the part of Sega's more sedate  mascot, providing a relaxing contrast to the hyperactive <i>Sonic the  Hedgehog</i> games. <i>Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future</i> continues  this tradition on the Dreamcast, putting the title character in charge of saving  the world yet again. An alien force (creatively called The Foe) has abducted all  the humans and most of the dolphins from earth, leaving only a tiny force of  dolphins to restore things to normal. As Ecco, players must travel through an  enormous underwater world, interacting with other sea creatures and solving  puzzles in a quest to stop The Foe once and for all."", ""The Dreamcast's power is exploited to beautiful new extremes in this game.

Play either the Soviet or American side; command and create over 30 units, such as antigravity tanks, walkers, guntowers, barracks, and recyclers--all while fighting from inside your own vehicle in single-player or multiplayer skirmishes."", 'Some folks might accuse Activision of duplicity for naming its newest action/strategy game Battlezone, but aside from the fact that both games put you in the cockpit of a tank, it has about as much in common with that arcade classic as an IBM PC Jr. does with a full-blown Pentium gaming system.', ""Yep, anyone who picks up this Battlezone expecting a graphics-heavy retread of the original will be in for a big surprise - but luckily it'll be an extremely pleasant one. Simply put, Battlezone is one of the best strategy games I've wrapped my brain (and trigger finger) around in a long, long time. And I've got three words for anyone who does complain that Activision stuck the Battlezone name on this product just to boost sales: get over it. Hell, I wouldn't care if they'd somehow managed to call it Super Mario's Metal Mayhem if it meant more people would be tempted to check it out."", 'Battlezone has the look and feel of a futuristic shooter, but it\'s actually set in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Seems that a meteor shower a decade earlier left behind some other-worldly stuff called ""bio-metal"" - the product of an alien technology that can not only be used to craft weapons of incredible power and durability, but which also seems to be sentient. (Now that would have made a decent Pet Rock!) Uncle Sam wants to use the bio-metal to bring the Cold War to an end, but - you guessed it - the Soviets found out about the bio-metal and are just as desperate as you to get their Commie hands on it first.', ""The quest for the miracle metal leads both nations into space to track down the mother lode - and hopefully uncover any other alien leftovers that could lead to ultimate victory. Beginning on the Earth's moon, the Americans and Russkies start to unravel the mysteries behind the bio-metal, leading to a race that takes them from Earth's closest planetary neighbors to the harsh worlds of Jupiter's moons Io and Titan - and to the realization that they must unite to defeat a force greater than both of them. It's a pretty good setup, if for no other reason than it means you get to enjoy seven types of terrain, each with its own distinct look and particular obstacles and hazards. And the narration between missions gives the whole affair a decidedly personal touch (though it does get a bit too melodramatic now and then)."", ""But what really makes Battlezone so special is the way it blends the adrenaline rush of first-person action games with the strategy and resource management of Red Alert (or one of its imitators). Sure, you'll see plenty of combat from the cockpit of your tank, but personal victories mean little or nothing in the grand scheme of things. At the same time that you're on the lookout for roving Russians, you must launch an extensive construction program, starting by guiding your Recycler to a geyser where it can draw power. The Recycler converts scrap metal (collected by Scavengers) that's used to build everything from tanks and turrets to factories, armories, and power plants. Once you've manufactured offensive and defensive weapons, they fall under your command: Although the game's AI means they'll always attack nearby enemies, you'll need to give them specific assignments to maximize their firepower and range."", ""It's been said that you eat with your eyes, and if that cliche holds true for games then Battlezone is a tempting treat indeed. Direct3D support makes for some of the best outdoor terrain and detailed vehicles I've seen in a game, and it's topped off with special effects such as fiery explosions, missile trails, thick clouds of haze, lightning bolts, and other visual goodies. This stuff isn't just eye candy, either; it all works together to create an intensely immersive experience. There are a few graphical glitches - white dots where textures weren't connected and a rapidly jerking plasma rifle are notable examples - but they were so few and far between I hardly gave them a second thought."", 'Not counting the tutorials, the single-player game includes 27 missions - 17 played from the US side and eight as the Soviets. Figuring that most gamers will want to saddle up as the good guys, the American missions progress so that you\'re given more to do as you get acquainted with the game; the Russian missions are supposedly aimed at ""experienced"" commanders, but by the time you\'ve played four or five US missions you should be able to handle at least some of the Soviet outings.', 'There are a couple of cupcake missions, but they\'re compensated for by the inclusion of some real bears. The charm of the mission design, though, is that there\'s rarely a single ""right"" way to do things: Several options are open to you, giving you the chance to choose the one that best suits your skills and style of play.', ""And should you tire of the single-player missions, Battlezone's got some extremely intense multiplayer options to keep the good feeling going even longer. The strategy mode (which gives you the same type of control as in the single-player game) provides a distinct experience each time out because there are so many approaches each opponent can take. I really didn't expect deathmatch to be as appealing - after all, you just run around and grab power-ups and kill everyone else - but after just a few matches I found myself enjoying it more than I'd thought possible. There's even a map editor to create your own multiplayer arenas."", ""There are two snags: Latency and the fact that you can start games before all players have joined (which gives the early bird a definite advantage in strategy mode). Some players on Activision's Battlezone server appeared to be completely oblivious to the concept of high latency, resulting in dropped packets (which means vital stuff like missile hits might not be transmitted), so if you do play on the server, you probably should start a game and only allow players with latencies below 500ms to join."", ""Battlezone is dotted with a few minor blemishes. Perhaps most noticeable is that the AI for friendly units can be a little dicey: Scavengers will sometimes stop their task and park outside Recyclers, for instance, and some offensive units aren't smart enough to follow a Recycler you're relocating if you told them to defend it while it was stationary. There's no way to order a scout or tank to follow a scavenger, tug, or transport unless the unit to be escorted is within your targeting range; there should be a way to assign an escort to any unit regardless of its location."", ""So how critical are these problems? I'll put it like this: Ninety percent of the reason I mentioned them is because that's my job, not because they bothered me much when I was playing. And I'm not saying that as a sop to Activision, or anyone else for that matter; I'm saying it because it's the truth."", ""Listen, I see games every day; it's what I do for a living. When I load one up and start raving about it to all my friends after a few hours of play, I know I've got the real deal on my hands - and that's just what Battlezone is. This might be the most perfect blend of two gaming genres since... well, I don't know when.1998 might be only three months old, but it's going to take a lot of effort for someone to crank out a better action/strategy game than Battlezone. <i>--Stephen Poole </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Lemmings Revolution - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The witless little lemmings have returned--this time in a simple, elegant 3-D world filled with hazards such as lava and perilous heights. Choose from one hundred puzzles you can play over and over again, such as the Treehouse, the Stone Tower, and more. The most recent addition to the lemmings lineage, <i>Lemmings Revolution</i> brings the challenge of a simple but elegant 3-D environment to the addictive strategy and puzzle game of rescuing the dopey lemmings from certain doom.', 'The Lemmings series is revered by both puzzle- and strategy-game fans, especially those who enjoy solving puzzle after mind-wracking puzzle into the wee hours. In Lemmings Revolution, developers Psygnosis and Take 2 have combined the addictive gameplay of the original Lemmings with smooth, accelerated 3D graphics. The gameplay and graphics are complemented with an interface that makes the game both easy to learn and fun to play. Were it not for a few bugs the game shipped with and a marked lack of settings options, Lemmings Revolution might have been the ultimate game for Lemmings fanatics.', ""The Lemmings gameplay is inextricably linked with the nature of the actual Norwegian rodent, which is famous for its bizarre migrating pattern in which huge masses of lemmings often end up careening into the sea to their deaths. Basically, a Lemming will stop at nothing to complete its migration. As in previous Lemmings games, each level in Lemmings Revolution requires that you get a certain number of lemmings safely from point A to point B. Point A is a box out of which your lemmings drop one by one. Point B is an escape balloon waiting in another area of the level. In between the points lies a host of traps and obstacles that this procession of little critters must negotiate. Lemmings won't try to save themselves - instead they walk aimlessly off every steep cliff and into every skull-crushing spike and pool of lava in their path. As the lemmings march on relentlessly, you must assign them skills to help them surmount these obstacles. The various skills have remained largely the same since the original 1991 game, and they include abilities such as building walkways, climbing, digging through platforms, and gliding down from high above. You're allocated a finite number of each skill to assign per level. As the levels increase in difficulty, you're given a wider variety of skills and a fewer number of each skill to spare. This is where the gameplay begins to get intensely challenging and fun."", ""As the levels become more complex, you must take a number of other elements into account. One new feature, the antigravity pad, makes for some interesting situations. When a lemming steps onto one of these, it flips upside down, landing either on the ceiling or on the ground, depending on where it started. With a few antigravity pads on a level, you're faced with the task of making sure the marching horde doesn't fall downward - or upward - to its death. Also, there are switches you'll have to toggle. Often you'll have to guide a single lemming to an area where it can trip a switch, which in turn triggers an event such as rising water or a retracting barrier. Water and acid pits also come into play relatively soon in the game. To traverse these safely you must employ water and acid-oriented lemmings, respectively. The wide variety of game elements opens up many gameplay possibilities."", ""In spite of the new additions, the classic Lemmings gameplay remains intact in Lemmings Revolution. However, the revolving 3D levels put a new spin on the action, literally. Part of playing the game involves constantly rotating the cylindrical map in order to keep an eye on your lemmings' activities. Rotating is easy, as it simply requires that you right-click and drag. The game also has a good pause feature. As levels get increasingly harder, you can pause mid-game and rotate to check the position of each lemming. This gives you time to plan out a strategy. While paused, you can select any lemming onscreen to ready it for its next job. Once you assign the lemming a task, it immediately goes to work, and the game un-pauses. To really hone in on what you're doing, you can hit the space bar to zoom in and out of the map."", 'Like previous Lemmings games, Lemmings Revolution has great level design. The early levels are simple, and they serve to acquaint you with the various types of lemmings skills. Later levels become increasingly difficult, as they force you to plan and manage your resources with the utmost care. Whenever you complete a level, two slightly tougher levels become available. This means that if a level becomes frustrating, you can simply quit to the level-select screen and take a stab at another. Still, it would have been nice if the developers could have included the auto-replay feature found in 3D Lemmings, where the computer replayed a level up to the point where you chose to take over for yourself.', ""Lemmings Revolution is probably the finest-looking game of the series, yet fans of spectacular 3D effects may be disappointed, as the levels are a bit stark. Of course, this graphical compromise means that the game will run smoothly on 266MHz systems on up. You may have scores of lemmings wandering onscreen during a game, but the graphic simplicity of the levels ensures that slowdown isn't likely to occur."", ""As it is, Lemmings Revolution lacks any kind of video options, and it won't let you assign your own controls. What's more, it shipped with a few sound, video, and input-device bugs that may cause problems for some players who are loading up the game for the first time. The game practically begs for a patch that addresses these issues."", ""Nevertheless, bugs or no, Lemmings Revolution is still a blast. The gradual learning curve, simple interface, and new features make it a great game for Lemmings novices and veterans alike. If you're a fan of the series, or you enjoy action-packed puzzle games, then you probably shouldn't hesitate to take the plunge and dig out 20 bucks for Lemmings Revolution. On the other hand, you may want to wait until a patch is available. --<i>Tim Soete</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Zeus: Master of Olympus - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>Zeus: Master of Olympus</i> is the sixth game in the award-winning Impressions City Building Series, which has sold over two million copies worldwide. <i>Zeus: Master of Olympus</i>, set in a mythological ancient Greece, serves up a world filled with the likes of Hercules, Athena, Ares, Medusa, the Minotaur, and many others. Players build and rule Greek city-states while summoning heroes and gods to protect their land from monsters and other Greek cities. Easy to learn, and quick to get in and out of, <i>Zeus</i> promises to be one of the most fun city-building games of 2000.', ""The folks at Impression Games have produced their best game yet with <I>Zeus</I>. By keeping the game simple, with clear goals and some great new elements, they've improved the series and the genre. The successful mantra for <I>Zeus</I> is keeping it simple on the surface, but allowing hardcore gamers to explore the depth. The interface is much improved from <I>Pharaoh</I>; the missions are shorter and the goals clearer, but the quantity of missions and gameplay has been increased. Setting up a successful city is easier, though creating a perfect city is still difficult. The gods are much less of a pain in the ass; now they go about trying to curry favor with the people as opposed to punishing them. Everything isn't roses, though, because there are still mythological bad guys to be dealt with. The city-building series has been popular before, but we think <I>Zeus</I> has the potential to blow this series up big-time.The realtime strategy genre can be split into two groups: the war games like <I>Star Craft</I> and <I>Age of Empires</I> and the others. Now, the group of others isn't just some collection of weird failures; quite the contrary, this group includes games like <I>The Sims</I>, <I>Roller Coaster Tycoon</I> and <I>Sim City</I>. As well as the games that make up Impression's city-building series: <I>Caesar</I>, <I>Pharaoh</I> and now <I>Zeus</I>. Every iteration of the series has been an incremental evolution in quality -- <I>Pharaoh</I> was good, but <I>Zeus</I> is great.<P>The first thing anyone familiar with <I>Caesar</I> and <I>Pharaoh</I> will notice about <I>Zeus</I> is the simplicity of the interface. One criticism of <I>Pharaoh</I> involved the confusing pseudo-hieroglyphic buttons. <I>Zeus</I> has simple icons that not only follow the Greek theme, but are easily recognizable: A cog represents industry and a vase distribution. That level of simplicity carries forward throughout the entire interface. It's much easier for the novice to pick up the game and start playing, especially with the great tutorials.<P>The gameplay itself has been streamlined as well. Perhaps realizing that most players want to see the special buildings like theaters, parks, large shrines and developed housing, the amount of administrative support services has been decreased. It's much simpler to take care of the required low-level activities and get on to increasing the appeal of the city. It's as if the Greeks have a simpler, more relaxed lifestyle than the Egyptians. The Greek gods protect them for the most part, make the cities better and fight mythological creatures. Overall gameplay is a bit more relaxed; as a player it's much easier to sit back and watch city life, to take time to follow the walkers as they move through the city or watch entertainers perform. There are so many different animations that even the hardcore sim fan will want to sit back and enjoy the show a bit.<P>The best improvements to the game are the improved campaign structure and sandbox modes. There are multiple campaigns, each divided into smaller missions. The level of difficulty is part of the campaign description, ranging from easy to challenging. Combine the campaign difficulty with the five levels of game difficulty and the variations should allow anyone to play. The missions themselves are much smaller, so players can pick up the game and play for 10 hours or 30 minutes, depending on their schedule. Campaign cities carry over from one mission to another, which is much more satisfying than constantly building up cities and then abandoning them. Cities form colonies, which are where new city building takes place; the primary city is still active, and the campaign will invariably swing back to allow further development. <P>Clearly the very best new additions are the three sandbox modes, which remove the storyline from the game, giving players the option to just create cities and enjoy their evolution. Economic sandbox gives the player a goal of fiscal domination of Greece; military sandbox sets up a goal of military domination; and open sandbox is an amazing map with all resources and the freedom of doing anything.<P>There is a minor amount of violence in <I>Zeus</I> as the gods fight with beasts or your army defends your city, but in general it's nothing like normal resource-based realtime strategies, making the game ideal for people who want a holiday title with less bloodshed.<P>There are a few problems with <I>Zeus</I>; every title has 'em. The full install is pretty large for such a simple game -- 620 MB -- and at times there were a few strange slowdowns in the game. Overall, we had no compatibility problems and can't see what would need to be patched -- a refreshing change for the season.<P>While the material isn't as familiar to most players as the theme parks of <I>Roller Coaster Tycoon</I> or the modern life of <I>The Sims</I>, we found <I>Zeus</I> to be just as enjoyable a game. If controlling the development of a civilization was ever an interest, this is a game to try -- and if you've already played these types of games, you definitely don't want to miss this one. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>""]","by

You'd better be if you hope to succeed in <i>Tribes 2</i>, an epic first-person shooter where the lifetime of a lone wolf is usually measured in seconds. Like its predecessor, <i>Tribes 2</i> focuses on team-based multiplayer combat in 40th-century wars between jetpack-equipped infantry factions. A minimal single-player tutorial campaign is included to let newcomers familiarize themselves with the game's mechanics, but nothing can fully prepare a person for the chaos of <i>Tribes 2</i>'s unique flavor of multiplayer first-person combat."", ""<i>Tribes 2</i> simply shines in the multiplayer team conflicts for which it was designed, and the tactical possibilities are nearly endless. Players can hop into vehicles, as a pilot skims over the planet's surface and threads narrow canyons while team members in the back blast enemies as they whip by. Miles of varying terrain separate each team's base, yet the transitions from outdoors to indoors are entirely seamless, regardless of an installation's complexity. There are endless weapon load outs and armor combinations from which to choose, and equipment, such as targeting lasers and deployable defense turrets, really add to the game's depth. For example, a player in light scout armor can quickly move to within range of an outpost, then illuminate it with the targeting laser for his heavily armed buddies crouching behind a hill. These heavies can fire their mobile mortars in complete safety with the knowledge that the laser will guide the rounds on target. This is just one example of the need for teamwork in <i>Tribes 2</i>."", ""Graphically, <i>Tribes 2</i> leaves a little to be desired in terms of detail, but the massive environments more than compensate for that shortcoming.

Ridge Racer V - PlayStation 2,,['Acceleration and braking based on the pressure you put on the buttons'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation 2', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Ps2 ~ Ridge Racer 5', ""The original <i>Ridge Racer</i> was the meat in Sony's launch sandwich when the original PlayStation hit the U.S. The arcade driving game came home and introduced console gamers to the next big thing. But today, those halcyon days seem like ancient history. As the <i>Ridge Racer</i> series evolved, it became much more than a simple arcade port, adding more tracks and cars, and refining the game's trademark powerslide style of driving. The last installment of the game, <i>Ridge Racer Type 4</i>, really seemed to be as good as the series could get on the existing hardware. Thankfully, Sony has come along with a new box, and Namco is keeping pace with a new <i>Ridge Racer</i> game. But <i>Ridge Racer V</i> all but ignores most of the gameplay refinements that the series has seen over the years, returning to the general driving style of games like <i>Ridge Racer</i> and <i>Ridge Racer Revolution</i>."", ""Graphically, <i>Ridge Racer V</i> is the most impressive of the PlayStation2 launch games. The game looks like the other <i>Ridge Racer</i> games, but without all the pop-up and pixelated vehicles and environments. Little things like trees on the sides of the track, and the glow that emanates from your red-hot brake pads as you brake while driving around corners really bring a lot to the look of the game. You can even see the gauges inside your car light up when your headlights come on in a tunnel or while night-driving. The cars are well designed, and the environment mapping that creates the almost-too-shiny reflection on your car is pretty amazing. The display isn't flawless, though. The entire game has a very aliased appearance, making the edges of the cars and tracks look really jagged. The better your TV is, the more noticeable the aliasing becomes. Also, there are some seemingly random moments of slowdown, but it's rare and only occurs for less than a second. The game still sports only two camera angles, a first-person and third-person view. The third-person view is much tighter and closer to your vehicle than in the previous games, and it takes a bit of getting used to. The two-player mode runs at roughly the same speed as the single-player game, though the draw-in distance is a bit closer in the splitscreen mode, making the two-player races look a bit foggy."", ""The gameplay in <i>Ridge Racer V</i> is centered on the grand-prix mode. This is the mode that will net you additional cars, trophies, and new engines. You start out by picking one of three difficulty settings and entering the standard grand prix. Then you go on to the extra mode, a collection of four grand-prix events. Standard mode lets you pick any one of the game's base-level cars, then as you progress with that car into the extra ranks you'll earn upgraded versions of that base car. The track design is pretty standard <i>Ridge Racer</i> fare. Each track uses lots of the same portions of road, and certain sections of track will open or close depending on which track variant you're racing. This makes all the tracks seem a little too similar and limits the game's replay value. As in <i>R4</i>, the final track is an oval-shaped racetrack built for sheer speed. Another knock against the track design is that a lot of the sections are lifted from, or at least heavily influenced by, the track from the original <i>Ridge Racer</i>. You'll recognize the tunnels and turns the first time you see them. It would have been nice to see multiple environments and a more varied track design instead of being limited to racing the tracks both forward and backward."", ""The car handling is similar to that of the older <i>Ridge Racer</i> games in that it places a much heavier emphasis on powersliding around corners so you can traverse the tracks at high speeds. The sliding is emphasized by reducing the turning radius on most of the game's cars, which all feel a little sluggish when you're maneuvering back and forth across the lanes, when compared with any of the previous games in the series. Even the grip cars require you to do a decent amount of sliding around turns. The drift cars lose traction at the blink of an eye and really force you to play to perfection. Luckily, the control is excellent with the Dual Shock 2, and the game supports both of Namco's driving controllers, the Negcon and the Jogcon. The game uses the analog buttons of the Dual Shock 2, but it's extremely hard to notice when the analog gas and braking make a difference. Some of the later drift cars in the game seem to slide a bit differently depending on how hard you tap the brake button."", 'The sound effects in <i>Ridge Racer V</i> are pretty nice. The squealing tires and engine noise of the cars sound realistic. The game has an announcer similar to the ones in the previous games, but he repeats himself a little too often (for instance, he almost always says, ""That was tight"" whenever you pass the second- or first-place car) and mispronounces a few words, like ""comfort"" and ""rookie."" It\'s almost funny.', 'The music has always been a large part of the <i>Ridge Racer</i> series, and <i>Ridge Racer V</i> offers up a bit more of a mixed bag than usual. Rather than sticking solely to various forms of electronic music, <i>RRV</i> delivers some poppier tunes from the Boom Boom Satellites, as well as some pretty hot techno numbers. One of the best tracks is the music that plays in the menus before the race actually starts.', ""<i>Ridge Racer V</i> is a fun, great-looking game that will please older <i>Ridge Racer</i> fans. Players that picked up the series around the third or fourth game may be a little disappointed with the way the cars handle, but not so much that their fun will be ruined. Overall, the game feels a little rushed with its easy-way-out track design, and it's our hope that Namco will attempt to address the aliasing and slowdown issues before the game is released in the States later this year. <i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 2000 GameSpot Inc.

There\'s definitely an epic feel to the game, permeating and penetrating throughout, and somehow making all the searching, and fighting, and dying worthwhile. <P> Yes, dying. While its gameplay and graphics are clearly intended to compete with the likes of contemporary releases like Tomb Raider, the spirit of Mask of Eternity is much more ancient, closer to now-distant adventures like Zork or even Sierra\'s Mystery House. Which is to say - for those of you who were spared the primal days of computer gaming - that it\'s cruel and unforgiving and occasionally borders on the sadistic. Death awaits literally at every turn: drink the wrong potion, step in the wrong direction, pick the wrong camera angle (more on that later), and you\'ll find yourself on your knees, gasping for breath, and finding none. <P> Not that dying is all you\'ll be doing in Mask of Eternity. You\'ll be doing your fair share of killing as well. Almost everything that moves is fair game, and as the game progresses, you\'ll find that you have a variety of weapons at your disposal with which to dispatch your enemies. Combat is a rather rudimentary affair - there is no defensive component and attacking involves little more than clicking the mouse at regular intervals - but it adds an element of excitement and - if I can say it without sounding too ironic - ""life"" to the game in the sense that you must respond in real time to the challenge at hand. Combat is also important because with each victory, your character gains strength and skill (this is the game\'s RPG element), both of which are necessary to have more than a prayer against the later bosses in the game. <P> But as significant as combat is in Mask of Eternity, the balance of the game is spent using your head, not your sword. There are literally hundreds of puzzles to be solved, ranging from the relatively simple to the fiendishly complex. Many are ""means"" puzzles - you know exactly what you\'re supposed to do, and the problem is figuring out how to do it - while others involve the manipulation/combination of objects resulting in unexpected but favorable consequences. While one could argue that some of the puzzles are too tough or too obscure for the typical player, they are certainly consistent with those of previous King\'s Quest games and Sierra adventures in general, a fact that will no doubt please many old-school adventure gamers who have long protested the dumbing down of their favorite genre in recent years. <P> What may not please these hard-core adventurers is the heavy use of action-oriented puzzles throughout Mask of Eternity. Many sections of the game require more than a little dexterity to complete, and some - particularly those that involve a series of sequential jumps - may even have console gamers pulling out their hair. As mentioned previously, the frustration level in the action-oriented sequences in the game never quite gets to the point of no return, but it does come close at times. This is unfortunate, because in many cases, the problem isn\'t with the design of the sequences themselves, but rather with your own inability to position the camera with a satisfactory view of the action. <P> That\'s right, the player controls the camera in Mask of Eternity. You can choose from either first-person or third-person perspectives, and your choice matters, as in some cases, you can only advance if you select the proper view. In addition, when in the third-person perspective, you have total control over the angle and height of the camera and can change it almost at will. The upside is that if you find your view blocked by a tree or obscured by an enemy, you can quickly shift the perspective to something more useful. The downside is that you must do so to complete the game. By putting the control in the player\'s hands, the designers essentially washed their own of any responsibility for an ""intelligent"" camera, and if you don\'t take command, you will quickly fall prey to its stupidity. While offering control over the camera is a great boon for players, requiring them to master it is not. It\'s somewhat akin to having to edit a movie when all you want to do is watch it. <P> Otherwise, the graphics engine is very solid, fast, and often impressive when used with a 3D accelerator (the software-only renderer is far less attractive). It handles outdoor and indoor scenes equally well and, when combined with the very detailed character animations, offers a believable depiction of the world it portrays. The only real problem with the graphics lies in the details: There\'s a certain sense of barrenness throughout the game, and long stretches of look-alike terrain are common. You also see some rather pronounced pop-up in the more complex areas, which is a little distracting. And then there are the load times, which can last up to two or three minutes between realms - which is simply too long. <P> Fortunately, there\'s enough going on in the audio department to make up for any graphical missteps. Mask of Eternity has a lush, orchestral soundtrack that greatly enhances the gaming experience. The dialog, while occasionally campy in its presentation, is well written and generally well read. And the sound effects are uniformly excellent. <P> As you can see, Mask of Eternity is really a game of contrasts, a game that takes two steps forward, but just as quickly takes another step back. Its gameplay is enjoyable, but occasionally maddening. Its combat system is welcome, but too simple. Its camera control system is advanced, but almost to a fault. Its design attempts to attract all players, but in doing so, may just as easily alienate them. <P> In the final analysis, the most important thing about Mask of Eternity is that even with all its faults, it\'s a fun game to play. It\'s recommended to those who want something out of the ordinary, and who can appreciate a grand and ambitious effort. And Sierra should be applauded for trying something new, even if its reach somewhat exceeds its grasp. <i>--Vince Broady</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Summoner,,['Summoner'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation 2', 'Games']",{},"[""Sometimes it's just too hard to try to do things all alone. Take, for example, Joseph, who is on a quest to find some ancient rings. As a summoner--a type of sorcerer who can conjure creatures out of the ether and make them do his bidding--Joseph has the luxury of calling in a little reinforcement help when things get a little too hot. However, the summoner has had some bad luck using these special powers in the past. As a result, he has to be especially judicious in summoning. Thankfully, not all of his help comes via incantation; along the way he'll run into others who can join him in his mission. <i>Summoner</i>, one of the first role-playing games for the PS2, includes a multiplayer party-based mode."", '<i>Summoner</i> highlights all of the reasons that many  publishers steer clear of the role-playing game (RPG) genre. Most RPGs are heavy  on text, light on adventure, and thus--for most gamers--boring.', ""The setup to <i>Summoner</i>'s sweeping story line is so slow at the beginning  that anything good that comes later in the game is masked completely. As the  story begins, you play as Joseph, a young gent who has vowed never again to use  his summoning powers.

Those  who stick through this heavy exposition will be rewarded with a twisting,  nonlinear plot."", ""The environments are carefully designed, built, and textured to convey a grand  sense of scale and color. The castle's courtyard, for example, is a great place  to visit--its booths and caravans are festooned with colorful cloths and  coverings. The place is abuzz with people, many of whom want to chat and share  information with you. The castle itself is immense, and dwarfs everything and  everyone around it. The game's graphical splendor is cut somewhat short,  however, by draw-in problems that give it a terribly disjointed look."", ""<i>Summoner</i>'s combat system is pretty cool. The idea is to chain your  attacks by pressing the controller's D-pad while your sword blow is being  delivered. A little chain icon appears above your character's head and signals  when to time your move.

Then use that energy to perform big-ticket combos that will help reap high scores.', ""With its mesmerizing graphics, fantastic controls, and high  replayability, <i>SSX: Snowboard Supercross</i> is good enough to be considered  among the finest PlayStation2 launch titles by any fan of video gaming. It's one  of those genre-defining and system-justifying games that'll please even folks  who normally dislike snowboarding games. It's just that good!"", ""After selecting from one of the four initially available racers, you must race  against a full field of opponents down long, twisting, and sometimes gravity-  and physics-defying courses. What makes <i>SSX</i> a standout from similar games  is Electronic Arts' amazing attention to detail. The tracks show much variety in  their outrageous twists, bumps, jumps, and ramps. However, to utilize them best,  you must perform potentially backbreaking, neck-snapping tricks. Okay, you  actually won't suffer any physical damage, but the cartoony falls do look rather  painful."", ""The tricks are done by successfully performing complex button-mashing and  joystick-twisting combs. The more and better the tricks you perform, the higher  a speed boost you'll get to help you finish a track quickly. In order to  progress through all of the rounds in World Circuit mode (the meat of the game),  you must place at least third in each race. Successful completion of races also  can unlock new characters and snowboards--each with dramatic performance  differences. It might look somewhat similar to <i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</i> or  other snow games, but <i>SSX</i> is a totally different take."", ""<i>SSX</i>'s illusion of speed is simply fantastic. Should you manage to take  your eyes off your well-animated racer to check out the scenery, you'll see  bright lighting effects, cheering crowds, lots of snow spray, and a wide variety  of background visuals that hint at the PS2's graphics prowess. It's also that  same sense of speed that delivers a great feeling of accomplishment when your  board lands safely on the snow pack after you complete a complex trick that was  performed absurdly high in the air."", ""Almost all of <i>SSX</i>'s animations are as smooth as glass. There's minor  slowdown when you turn through some of the larger hills, but this is barely  noticeable and rarely interferes with gameplay. The bumping soundtrack changes  on the fly, and is based on your performance. The better your tricks and speed,  the wilder and more up-tempo the music gets. All of the enormous courses--some  of which can take close to 10 minutes to finish--have many shortcuts and  alternate routes to cut into your finishing time."", 'One gripe with the game is that your character, after painfully crashing into  cold hard snow, sometimes start moving will in the exact opposite direction that  you were racing originally.

Utilizing PS2's advanced hardware, the game renders ultrarealistic rushing, passing, blocks, and tackles. As the game progresses, you'll see the field collecting scars of some of the rougher tackles, and the players will show some wear of their own as well. With the Dual Shock 2's pressure-sensitive controls, you can control the type of tackle you make by how hard you hit the button. Along with the built-in AFC and NFC lineups, <I>Madden NFL 2001</I> allows you to create your own player, choosing between 200 faces, a variety of hair styles and pads--even whether or not he wears a breathing strip on his nose!"", ""Madden 2001 for the PlayStation 2 is the best iteration of the game we've ever seen. EA Sports has delivered just about everything a fan of the series could hope for, and while it focuses on technical and simulation elements a bit more than the other games on the market, the game stays true to the Madden name."", 'The game has more features and options than any other Madden game before. It includes all of the fundamental options, like exhibition and season modes, and all of the in-depth options, like franchise, create-a-player, and Madden challenges. The Madden challenges have a bit more to them this year, since the completion of each one earns you tokens, which you can use like money in the game. You can purchase special items like cheats, secret players, and teams. You can even use the tokens, with the help of a couple of memory cards, as currency to wager with when challenging another player. The Madden challenge cards, which are displayed when you buy items, were made in conjunction with Upper Deck and look like really cool digital trading cards. They add a whole new incentive for playing the game and completing the Madden challenges.', ""The control in Madden 2001 is pretty much just like any that of any other Madden game, although some will find the overall feel of the game a bit too slow and unresponsive. The game uses a momentum-based physics engine, which is supposed to make the gameplay all the more real. The only problem is that it plays a bit too real - players have to literally stop their momentum when making a change in the direction they're running, just like in real life. This, while physically correct, just doesn't translate into fast-paced, hard-hitting football action. Instead, it causes the reaction time of a controller command to be a tad too slow, leaving the game feeling a bit sluggish. In time, you do learn to accommodate for this, and the effect isn't nearly so bad. The AI of the game will surely to seem familiar to fans of the series, particularly those who've played this year's PlayStation version.  The AI's easiest setting will let you get away with a lot and teaches you early on that the game is all about knowing your team's plays and your players' abilities. Knowing which players to go to will help you blow the doors off the computer on the lower skill settings, but once you start to move up, you'd better have more than just a few tricks up your sleeve."", 'Visually, Madden 2001 on the PlayStation 2 is unsurpassed in its detail and polish. The game is almost perfect in its visual replication of the fields and players of the NFL. The textures used for the fields, jerseys, and skin of the players is incredible. Grass fields look just like real grass, which can actually get lodged in the corner of a player\'s facemask after he sinks his head into the soil after a missed dive tackle. During the game\'s replays, you can actually see the individual bumps of the pigskin on the football. All of these little visual details really make the game look and feel real. For instance, line judges will hastily drop the line markers and move out of the way when players run out of bounds in their direction. The animations of the players themselves are extremely fluid and realistic. The players move and perform stiff arms, catches, and tackles quite authentically. The multiple point collision detection system of the game allows the tackles in the game to look more realistic and be based more on individual situations than ever before. When you blindside a quarterback, he really goes down in a real ""lights out"" type of collapse. Speaking of lights, the lighting effects in Madden 2001 are fantastic. When you play a game at a field that has an open dome during the day, you can actually see the difference between the shadow of the partial dome and the direct sunlight shining down from above.  Even when you\'re playing a night game, the shadows cast on the field by the players from the stadium lights look real. To aid this realistic looking lighting, the helmets of the player\'s are extremely shiny and reflect the player\'s surroundings. While the reflection off the helmets is a convincing effect at first, it loses something after you see it in every post-play close-up. This is also the case for the faces of the players as well. When you first see the player\'s faces, they appear extremely articulated since they come complete with intelligent expressions that react to plays and situations with appropriate responses such as a smile or a scowl. After a few games, though, you realize they are a bit over the top and actually appear a little too plastic looking. There are, of course, a few other minor visual flaws that you could nitpick about, like the way the ball magically switches from one hand to another or the minor clipping that occurs when multiple players tackle the ball carrier.  But most of these things are only noticeable during replays and not during play.', 'In the audio department, Madden 2001 isn\'t nearly as impressive.  This is largely due to the lack of excitement in John Madden and Pat Summerall\'s typical commentary, which consists of the dry play-by-play provided by Summerall punctuated by the occasional Maddenism like ""boom"" or ""pop."" The rest of the sound effects are all very authentic and sound fantastic with a surround-sound system. The crowd actually sounds quite real, as their cheering is tied into the action - you\'ll even hear them chant the name of a home team favorite when he makes a big play.', ""In the end, Madden 2001 is the most realistic and complete video game interpretation of the sport of football ever. The level of detail in the game's presentation and feel is so dramatically superior to previous football games, it's unbelievable. If you enjoy football in the least, the game is a must-have PlayStation 2 game, and even if you don't like football, you may want to pick the game up just to see how amazing it looks. In any event, the game is easily the best iteration of the Madden series. Though it may be a little heavier on the simulation side than the previous games, it's still a Madden game at heart.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald </i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc.

Blair Witch Episode 1: Rustin Parr 1941 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Fans of the horror game <i>Nocturne</i> may remember Doc Holliday, one of that game's supernatural investigators, not to be confused with the legendary (and real) 19th-century gunslinger. She stars here in <i>Blair Witch Episode 1: Rustin Parr</i> as lead investigator into the mysterious murder of seven Maryland children. Your goal is to collect evidence and try to resolve the one unshakable question: Why? You'll interview townsfolk, investigate local legend, and analyze clues from the crime scene. Your path will surely lead to dark, otherworldly ends, so keep your weapons handy and a torch close by!"", 'The filmmakers behind The Blair Witch Project created a lengthy and involved history regarding the mysterious goings-on in Burkittsville (also known as Blair), Maryland. Of the many supernatural events they concocted, the creepiest is the story of Rustin Parr. According to the fictional tale, seven children disappeared from Burkittsville during the early 1940s. In 1941, a hermit named Rustin Parr left his house in the forest, walked into town, and said to a local shopkeeper, ""I\'m finally finished."" Six of the children were found murdered in Parr\'s basement; one child, Kyle Brody, was still alive and standing in the corner. The story of Parr will be somewhat familiar to those who saw the film. Parr\'s house was the site of the final scene, and it\'s the key to the film\'s cryptic ending. The murders are also the subject of Blair Witch Volume 1: Rustin Parr, the first entry in Gathering of Developers\' three-game Blair Witch series.', 'The game was developed by Terminal Reality, whose Nocturne tread similar ground. In fact, Rustin Parr is a sort of sequel to Nocturne. It uses the same engine and the same characters. You play Elspeth ""Doc"" Holliday, who was only a bit player in Nocturne but gets the starring role in Rustin Parr. Holliday is an agent of Spookhouse, a government agency set up to investigate the supernatural, and she is sent to Burkittsville to see if there is any truth to Parr\'s claims that he was under the influence of otherworldly forces when he committed the murders.', ""It's a good premise, and the pairing of the Spookhouse agents with the Burkittsville legend seems like a perfect match. And, for the most part, it works. Rustin Parr manages to pack in some really scary moments. However, as in Nocturne, the reliance on gunplay and monster killing takes away from the more subtle tone of the game. The Resident Evil-like monster infestations in Blair Witch Volume 1 seem out of place. The game - like the film - is at its scariest when there is merely the suggestion that something supernatural is afoot. When it's blatant, it just gets silly."", 'Before heading to Burkittsville, you must go through a training session. Here, all of the Nocturne engine\'s shortcomings are in full effect. The shifting third-person perspective can make the combat frustrating and difficult, as in most every other games of this type since Alone in the Dark. The designers have but one suggestion: Find a better camera angle when fighting. This is actually a ""technique tip"" in the training mission, and it makes you wonder why the designers didn\'t follow their own advice and replace ""fighting"" with ""designing.""', ""This tip actually won't work when combat becomes constant later in the game, as moving to a new location simply means finding more enemies and a potentially worse angle to fight from. Moreover, the game's auto-aim feature in inconsistent, and it's hard to keep a bead on incoming adversaries. Luckily, combat is an optional element throughout most of the game, perhaps unintentionally. It's quite easy to just avoid most enemies altogether and run past them. You'll have a huge train of undead beasts on your tail as a result, but not fighting them can save you some trouble."", ""Rustin Parr picks up once the training mission is over, when Holliday goes to Burkittsville and begins investigating. There's more of an adventure element in Rustin Parr than there is in Nocturne, and Holliday keeps excellent notes so that you stay on track. However, this adventure element isn't very pervasive, and you'll probably wish you could interact more with the townies, but you'll still get a good deal of interesting history and friend-of-a-friend anecdotes about the evil that lurks in the woods."", ""The first chapter ends with a strange sequence that is among both the game's best and worst. The townsfolk all become floating demons reminiscent of The Evil Dead, and you need to destroy them all. It's your first taste of combat since the training, and it's some of the only gunplay you'll actually be required to engage in over the course of the game. But what's most interesting about the sequence is how it ends: It has two endings. The first of these is really terrifying, and it seems to send the game hurtling in an interesting direction. Then you'll get the real ending, which lessens the shock of what you've just seen. Your first trip into the Black Woods is a lengthy maze sequence that requires you to find Rustin Parr's house and a landmark called Coffin Rock. Not much happens, and you'll doubtless get a bit frustrated as you wander through the woods. Get used to it: Each time you enter the woods (and you go there quite often) you'll need to navigate the maze again. These treks through the woods can be tiring, as the constantly shifting angle makes navigating in a single direction difficult. Even with the compass activate, you'll often find yourself running in exactly the wrong direction."", ""Once you find Parr's house, you'll get a good sense of how scary the game can be. Because of its great lighting and shadow-rendering capabilities, the Nocturne engine is excellent for creating atmosphere. And Parr's house is a perfect example - you'll keep thinking you see subtle flashes of things in the darkness that may or may not have been there, and it's really creepy."", ""The rest of the game consists of traveling from Burkittsville to the woods, as you learn more and more about what is really lurking out in the forest. The story is interesting although a bit convoluted. And there's a temporal shifting in the woods that is used effectively, if not frequently enough. The monsters (which become more and more abundant in the woods as the game goes on) mostly consist of undead animals and humans, though the weird, shambling stick bundles you'll also encounter are somewhat scary. But for a game that evokes its major scares with subtlety, it's strange that your first major monster encounter would be with a big, invisible scorpion."", ""The endgame sequence is fun but a bit of a letdown. You won't have to do much, and at one point the game takes over, and you just watch. It's a pretty tense sequence, but it seems relatively easy compared with some of the trickier parts of the game. The best part comes just before the end, when you must execute a series of puzzles that are both interesting and original. It's a great sequence, and seemingly every time you think it's over, there's one more thing you have to do. Rustin Parr would have been a more consistently fun game if this type of puzzle solving had been more prevalent."", ""The game looks good, though some of the human character models are a bit awkward and the constant flowing effect of their coats looks somewhat unnatural. But the great shadow effects and the desolate appearance of the town and the woods all help add to the creepy atmosphere. The sound does a good job of adding to the atmosphere as well: The often-hammy voice acting is immediately noticeable, though the voices of both Holliday and her colleague, Nocturne's protagonist, The Stranger, are great. The game even has two excellent puzzles that require you to analyze sounds on a tape recorder. And both The Sixth Sense and The Exorcist before it proved that a tape recorder can be a very scary device."", ""Although it is inconsistent, Rustin Parr is fun. The good parts make slugging through the mediocre combat worthwhile. The atmosphere is great, and though it may just be because of the long shadows and dark corners, it still works. Rustin Parr won't take you very long to finish, but it will give you a few good scares along the way.<i>--Ron Dulin</i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Escape from Monkey Island - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<i>Escape from Monkey Island</i> continues in the hilarious tradition of its critically hailed and award-winning predecessors, <i>The Secret of Monkey Island</i>, <i>Monkey Island 2: Le Chuck's Revenge</i>, and <i>The Curse of Monkey Island</i>. Developed by the team who created LucasArts's irreverent classic <i>Sam and Max Hit the Road</i>, <i>Escape</i> features an original cinematic story full of drama, intrigue, and of course, sidesplitting humor. The game is highlighted by hundreds of challenging puzzles, set amidst dozens of rich and brilliantly rendered backgrounds."", ""The day fast approaches when Guybrush Threepwood, Elaine Marley-Threepwood, Stan of Stan's Previously Owned Vessels, and the other bizarre characters from the beloved, anachronistic <i>Monkey</i> series come back to PC shores."", ""In contrast to most LucasArts adventures, the Monkey Island games have always been really over the top. Whereas games like Full Throttle and Grim Fandango emphasized character and story, the Monkey Island games have increasingly leaned toward trying to make you laugh by means of an endless barrage of puns and pop-culture references. This is true of Escape from Monkey Island, the fourth game in the series. Much of it is funny, although a lot of it isn't. This inconsistency winds through the whole game, from the puzzles to the interface. When it's good, Escape from Monkey Island is very, very good. But the game's missteps do detract from the overall experience."", ""In this chapter of Guybrush Threepwood's adventures, the self-proclaimed mighty pirate and his new bride, Governor Elaine Marley, have returned from their honeymoon only to find that Elaine has been declared dead. This incorrect declaration has ended her lifetime term as governor, so she must now run against Charles L. Charles, a foppish glad-hander with a dark secret. What adds to the political intrigue is that the pirate hangouts in the Tri-Island area are being bought up and made into tourist-friendly venues like StarBuccaneer's and Planet Threepwood, thanks to an Australian land developer named Ozzie Mandrill. To top it all off, everyone seems to be looking for a voodoo artifact called the Ultimate Insult. These events aren't as unrelated as they may seem, and Guybrush must help Elaine stop the gentrification of his stomping grounds and find the Ultimate Insult before it falls into the wrong hands."", ""To reach these ends, Guybrush must once again explore the strange Caribbean Islands that surround his home, Melee Island. He'll visit Jambalaya Island (the island most affected by Mandrill's takeover) and Lucre Island and once again return to the titular Monkey Island itself. Many of the locales will be familiar to longtime fans of the series, as will a number of the characters. LeChuck, Murray the skull, Herman Toothrot, Otis, Carla, Meathook, and many, many others make guest appearances. In fact, there may even be too many cameos by old favorites."", ""There's an old joke. A guy walks into a bar and notices people keep yelling out numbers, and everyone in the bar busts up laughing. He asks the bartender what's going on. The bartender tells him that the regulars have told the same jokes for so long that now they just refer to them by number. Much of the humor in Escape from Monkey Island is like this. Many jokes allude to earlier events in the series, and they're only funny if you're familiar with the references. For instance, the fact that Otis the pirate likes flowers is a gag from the first game, and here it seems like the designers are simply pointing it out, hoping you'll remember how funny it was the first time around."", ""It's true that Escape from Monkey Island does have plenty of new gags and characters, and many of them are really funny. The talking figurehead on Guybrush's new ship is particularly amusing, as are characters like Pegnose Pete; Marco de Pollo, the world's greatest cliff diver; and Miss Rivers, the teacher at the pirate reformation academy. The humor is enhanced by the universally excellent voice work. But some of the new characters aren't quite as interesting. Ozzie Mandrill, the evil real estate developer, is only funny if you think simply being Australian is funny - although his particular way of talking does lend itself to a very surreal match of Insult Sword Fighting, one of the more humorous sequences in the game."", ""The bout with Ozzie is the only appearance of the preferred dueling technique in the Tri-Island area. This time, you'll learn Insult Arm Wrestling and Monkey Kombat, a variation on the Insult competition and a parody of the fighting game Mortal Kombat. The concept is funny, but unfortunately Monkey Kombat may be the single biggest problem with Escape from Monkey Island. You must learn to trade barbs in the monkey language, and it all builds up to a really funny parody of Mortal Kombat's famous opening. But the art of Monkey Kombat itself is a frustrating one."", 'Monkey Kombat is a more complicated version of rock-paper-scissors - it features five fighting stances, each of which beats two other stances. You must say three of the four monkey words (""eek,"" ""ooop,"" ""chee,"" ""ack"") in a certain order to change stances, and each transition is unique. So, Drunken Monkey to Anxious Ape (and vice versa) might be ""ack eek oop,"" while Charging Chimp to Anxious Ape might be ""eek chee ack."" These only ""might be"" the right combinations, because the combinations and hierarchy are randomized with each new game. The only way to learn the art is through trial and error and copious note taking, and it becomes tiresome quickly. However, Monkey Kombat plays a principal part in the entire last third of the game.', ""The biggest change in Escape from Monkey Island from previous installments is that it uses a modified version of the Grim Fandango engine and interface. Grim Fandango was the first LucasArts game to use fully 3D characters on 2D prerendered backgrounds. It also featured a fully integrated keyboard interface that was designed to keep you firmly rooted in the reality of the game. Like Grim Fandango, Escape from Monkey Island uses 3D characters and 2D backgrounds, and it's a testament to the great artistic design that the game manages both to evoke and to improve upon the surreal pirate world that made its predecessor, Curse of Monkey Island, such a beautiful-looking game. The characters themselves fare a bit worse in Escape from Monkey Island, if only because they seem less expressive in 3D, but they still look great."", ""The only problem with the use of the Grim Fandango engine is the interface. Escape from Monkey Island dispenses with the basic concept of Grim Fandango's simple, text-free interface and instead reverts to making you choose from a series of text options and sort your inventory using a more conventional menu. Cycling through the possible actions in any location is a bit cumbersome, and at times it seems like the game would have been much easier to control with a standard mouse interface - though the designers did add some funny bits that you'll discover when you're sorting through your inventory in front of other characters."", ""You'll be cycling through your inventory often. The puzzles in Escape from Monkey Island primarily involve using objects in your inventory in creative ways, and many of these puzzles are good. But there are a few that make no sense at all, even in the bizarre world of the game. Finding Pegnose Pete's hideout requires a leap of logic that is baffling, and even after you finally locate the hideout, the solution makes little sense. But just as LucasArts was the first adventure-game maker to ensure that players would never die in a game, the company seems to be taking an equally strong stance against players getting stuck. Clues abound throughout the game, and a full walk-through is even included in the box - a bonus that seems as cynical as it is helpful."", ""Escape from Monkey Island is a great game that can be frustrating. At times it'll seem as if there were simply too many designers working on it and everyone wanted their ideas included. The puzzles are hit and miss, and so are the jokes. This is best illustrated by the traditional LucasArts post-credits joke, in this case a string of pop-culture references that goes on and on, as if no one could decide which of them were funny so they just decided to leave them all. But in most cases, the game can be a real pleasure to play, because enough of the puzzles are good and enough of the jokes are amusing. As such, veterans of the Monkey Island series will surely enjoy the game in spite of its occasional problems. However, players who're new to the Monkey Island series may get the sense while playing the game that they're watching a bunch of old friends regale each other with old in-jokes; it's easy to feel as if you're being left out of the fun if you don't catch the references. So while new players should approach the game with caution, if you're a fan of the previous installments, then Escape from Monkey Island is highly recommended.<i>--Ron Dulin </i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc.

Building on the <i>EX</i> branch of the series, this game has all of the old fighters you love (and love to hate) as well as the same controls. What's new is that these characters are now dynamic 3-D models working through a system of tag-team bouts. Try taking on three of these studied fighters at the same time. If you do well, one of them will choose to be your tag-team partner. You'll be able to switch between the two fighters at will or work them together in lethal dual combos. Also new to the series is the game's Hard Attack--an indefensible blow that reduces the competition."", ""Given its immense popularity, not to mention first-rate pedigree, it's  not surprising that <i>Street Fighter EX3</i> is among the first PlayStation2  titles. After the relative success of the first game for the original  PlayStation (PSX) and the disaster of the second, it'll be interesting to see  how long-term fans of the series take to yet another 3-D brawler with the  <i>Street Fighter</i> moniker. Even with classic characters--like Sagat, Blanka,  Ken, and (of course) Ryu--back to duke it out, this might be one horse that's  been beaten to death."", ""In <i>Street Fighter EX3</i>, players will be able to take advantage of a new  system that allows character switching at any time throughout the battle. Not  only will you be able to swap at will, but your dynamic duo also will have  double-teaming tag combos to enhance an opponent's agony. This means that gamers  will face three other opponents, and have four incredibly detailed fighters  battling it out on screen at any one time in the ultimate handicap match. Take  them out, and one might ask to join as your sidekick. Form a stable of four, and  all of you can take your turn kicking Bison's tail, as well as that of any of  the other famous <i>Street Fighter</i> characters in the game."", ""The control is predictable, but that's what fans want... nay, crave. Super  combos, dizzies, and a number of other staple <i>Street Fighter</i> combos are  here and look incredible. Lighting effects are much more mature: the animated  sparks fly, and the pyrotechnics flame up all over the place. Character models  have come a long way since the days of the first blocky <i>Street Fighter EX</i>  game. Although they still lack necks, these brawlers are seamless and well  defined. Their victorious poses rival any graphics that previously have been  seen on a console."", 'Not everything is peaches \'n\' cream with <i>EX3</i>, however.

In fact, the game pays homage to <I>Virtua Cop</I> in that the entire  targeting methodology looks and operates the same way.', ""Because the game's onscreen targeting system has an adjustable zoom on the  scope, it provides a level of accuracy that heretofore was unknown in console  games. All the better to see the highly detailed graphics that have been taken  straight from the arcade original (although manhandled and retrofitted by  Konami's art team to fit into the PS2's more texture-space-challenged RAM  allocation)."", 'Minus the physicality of the arcade game\'s ""big gun,"" the home game is  surprisingly similar in play.

Your actions decide whether you create a heaven or hell for your worshipers. Then select a creature from the land to act as your representative in the world. Raise it to gigantic proportions and teach it to do your bidding--whether the animal grows into an evil colossus of mass destruction or a kind and gentle giant is up to you. Progress through the game's rich storyline performing powerful miracles to battle other deities and become the world's supreme god."", ""Like a long-delayed, over-budget Hollywood monstrosity, we feared that <I>Black & White</I> was going to be one of those epic projects that simply couldn't live up to its billing. Instead, <I>Black & White</I> is one of the most compelling, beautiful and impressive pieces of code we have played in a long, long time. It is also insanely addictive. It combines the city-building of <I>Sim City</I> with the animal-raising of Tamagotchi, yet it takes those two passive activities and throws in some good old-fashioned Godzilla vs. Mothra monster fighting. Finally, someone has allowed us to raise our own enormous, ass-kicking, crap-throwing, carnivorous chimp! It takes a serious machine to run it, and the chintzy manual doesn't provide you with all the information you need, but if you own a halfway decent PC, then you should damn well own <I>Black & White</I>.</A> <I>Black & White</I> is not a game for people who don't like to read the manual. There are some wise guys here at Daily Radar who regard the manual in the same way they regarded the apple in their lunch boxes at school -- that is, as sheer junk. But if gamers are to succeed in a game as unorthodox as <I>Black & White</I>, they will need some patience and a willingness to learn. The manual is only so much help on this score, and the Good in us thinks that's because the game is so deep -- but the Bad in us suspects that it's so they can sell more strategy guides. But no matter what the reason, on the other side of the learning curve is a fantastic experience."", ""The comparisons to <I>Populous</I> are immediate and obvious. Peter Molyneux has taken the inspiration from his god-building game (in fact, there's a little taken from all of his earlier games here, from <I>Magic Carpet</I> to <I>Dungeon Keeper</I>) and turned it 3D. The goal is still the same: Players must encourage their believers to worship them so that they may in turn smite the non-believers. The single-player campaign features a battle against the current god-in-residence, Nemesis. Players must gather their strength, manage their villagers, cast some miracles and generally knock the other deities out of the god business. However, there is one thing in <I>Black & White</I> that is genuinely new."", 'The addition of learning, complex AI creatures is a brilliant addition to strategy games for several reasons. First of all, it brings some personality and a face to games that are often fought between tiny little units on a tiny battlefield. Second, most strategy games have bumped up against a technological limit in terms of sheer numbers. Both 2D and 3D fighting games reach their maximum number of units well before the end of the game. There are, after all, only so many things the computer can keep track of. But <I>Black & White</I> defuses that problem by having a single unit, your creature, grow and become more powerful as the game progresses.', ""But beyond the strategic importance of a single, massive unit is the fact that these little buggers are just so... endearing. There's nothing quite like taking your little baby tiger out for his first raw villager, his first tipped cow, his first crap in the neighbor's yard. And seeing mommy's little snookums grow up into an enormous black-eyed beast of remorseless evil that strides the land like death incarnate is just so, well, heartwarming. It is also possible to play the game on the side of Good, creating powerful versions of Ned Flanders that bring happiness to the other villages and help them water their crops and gather their wood. And, golly gee, that's swell too."", 'Even if <I>Black & White</I> did nothing more, it would earn its place on your shelf just as a monster creator. Without exaggeration, the learning AI in this game is simply beyond what has ever been attempted before. In the coming months and years, <I>Black & White</I> will remain the standard by which all AI is judged. Just as <I>Half-Life</I> is the bar over which all shooters must jump, <I>Black & White</I> simply raises the bar for intelligence over every other game ever made. You can teach your creature to do just about anything, and it will learn and imitate. There are even stories of advanced creatures that will play tricks on each other -- without being told to do so.', ""But even if molding a creature in your own image isn't sufficiently god-like for you, the strategy elements are deep and interesting. Players must encourage belief, either love or fear, in the little villagers. And the more villagers believe in them and worship them, the more power players have to convert the unfaithful. <I>B&W</I> uses a sphere-of-influence system that limits the realm in which the player can interact with the world. Move outside the sphere of influence, and your hand can only move, not grab or touch anything. Your creature thus becomes your ambassador, trained by you to be good, evil or something pragmatically in between."", ""Getting those villagers to survive and flourish can be tricky, though, and players not keen on micromanaging may have a tough go with <I>Black & White</I>. Desktop gods need to constantly keep an eye on their villagers, and sometimes satisfying those needs can be frustrating and distracting. Evil gods can naturally ignore the suffering of their denizens, but risk eroding their own power base in doing so. We played two different scenarios at the same time, one as good and one as evil. And to Lionhead's credit, we weren't able to find a significant advantage in playing one side over the other."", ""There is a significant advantage, however, in having a decent system to appreciate the game's visuals. In addition to the AI, <I>B&W</I> boasts a simply incredible engine. Players can zoom all the way out to see the entire island, or zoom all the way in to see individual villagers blinking. The streamlined interface takes some getting used to, but gamers who never grow comfortable with the default can remap the keys to a more comfortable WASD setup. Even the inside of the temple uses an entirely different engine where players can check on mission progress, save or load games, get help, or go to their creature cave to read up on the little guy (or put their own custom-made tattoos on him)."", 'And your creature will sport those nifty tats when you take it online. Once you have registered at <NO_LINKS=""http://www.bwgame.com"" target=""_new""><I>Black & White</I>\'s homepage</a>, you can take your creature online and play several different multiplayer games, including cooperative mode and clan play. Or you can play a quick skirmish game against the computer or a buddy over a LAN.', ""There are so many little features in <I>Black & White</I> that we could go on and on talking about them. For example, the game can be synched with your mail program so that it names your villagers from your contact list, and if you get some mail from someone on that contact list while playing the game, the little villager will let you know. When you register at <I>Black & White</I>'s homepage you can tell it to match the weather in the game to the weather in your part of the world. It also supports the Immersion TouchSense technology, so with a compatible force-feedback mouse you can feel the creatures rumble when you pet them, or the trees snap when you grab them out of the ground."", ""We could ramble on about the millions of tiny details in this game that make it so unique, such as the fact that the eight different ethnic villages (Japanese, Aztec, Norse, etc.) have their own cultural dances and music. Or the fact that your creature can blush or break dance. Or that if you get close to your village in the morning, you'll hear the roosters crow at the sun. Or even the fact that unlike most videogames, <I>Black & White</I> is the sort of thoughtful and intelligent game that recognizes that actions really do have consequences. It is for these and a lot of other reasons that we think <I>Black & White</I> will likely be the best PC game we will play this year. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>""]","by

Use the strengths of your fighters, tag back and forth, and crush your foes in defeat. The new version of Tekken Tag Tournament features 20 fighters who have appeared in the Tekken series since the first arcade game debuted in December 1994. Expect all the excitement of the original arcade game, plus plenty of all-new surprises.', ""The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts. From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked. Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely."", ""Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive. By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff."", ""Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison. The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall."", ""How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Bomberman Party Edition,,"['Bomberman returns to his old-school, 2D roots in BOMBERMAN PARTY EDITION', '2D graphics; blow each other to pieces; power-ups; tried-and-true game play formula; Modern or Classic modes']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Bomberman, a titled birthed on the NES and later honed to perfection on the TurboGrafx-16, SNES, and Genesis consoles, is a title with a reputation that hasn't been doing too well of late. With a poor, isometric 3D release on the Nintendo 64 and an even more atrocious PlayStation racing title, it seemed as if Hudson was hell-bent on erasing Bomberman from the annals of gaming lore forever. What a surprise, then, to see the PlayStation release of Bomberman Party Edition, a top-down Bomberman title that returns to the series' old-school gameplay roots. Even more surprising, Vatical has just released it here.  Bomberman Party Edition is a top-down battle game for up to five players. In it, you and your friends take control of what are known as - you guessed it - Bombermen, whose sole purpose in life is to lay time bombs. Wander around a maze of blocks, set bombs, gather power-ups, and lure your friends into explosive situations - that is the essence of Bomberman Party Edition. The formula itself may not sound impressive, but it's this simplicity that makes Bomberman insidiously addictive. You walk around and try to trap your friends in corners, and they try to do the same to you, all while multiple explosions erupt in every direction. From time to time, a Louie egg may appear, giving you an added power to use while sitting atop a cute kangaroo. Mix in standard power-ups that accentuate bomb strength, increase bomb capacity, allow bombs to be kicked, and a whole host of variations on the theme, and you end up with a game that is exciting, simple, and competitive."", ""If you don't like the rules in the battle mode, you can use the Bomberman Party Edition's custom mode to tweak the settings to your liking. The game offers a few new twists, such as screen-filling hyperbombs and post-death chariot riding, which you may enable or disable at your leisure. Some people won't enjoy flying around the screen and pestering their friends after they've been fragged, so it's nice to see an option to disable this feature. You can also adjust round length, number of matches per win, quantity of power-ups, and hit points as well. From the amount of available options, it is obvious a lot of effort went into creating Bomberman Party Edition's multiplayer mode."", ""Unfortunately, all is not rose petals and ice cream in Bomberman land. Bomberman Party Edition's single-player mode, as is usually the case among Bomberman titles, is trash. Prior Bomberman titles take you on a journey through lush jungles and bizarre alien worlds, exercising your bomb-dropping skills to save the world. Bomberman Party Edition not only lacks this subplot, but it also lacks the lush worlds. As you progress through the game's 50 levels, you'll combat endless hordes of mindless enemies on levels that barely differ from the multiplayer battle arenas. While there are more enemies to clear, there is no complimentary increase in detail or design. Furthermore, you get an extra life for every level you beat, throwing difficulty right out the window. Zero fun and zero challenge. About the only bright spot in the single-player mode is that playing with the classic visuals enabled gives the game a sort of 1987-era NES-style nostalgia."", ""Visually, there isn't much you can do with a top-down arena battle title. Bomberman's visual design peaked with Super Bomberman 3 and hasn't changed since. Despite a few post-explosion particle effects and transparencies, Bomberman Party Edition doesn't seek to improve upon this formula either. While the formerly anime-style character models now have a pseudo-CGI feel imposed on them, the overall look and feel is on par with Saturn Bomberman - in other words, crisp and nondistracting. The game's sound quality meets a much worse fate, however. Sound effects and character voice snippets are hilarious and impacting, but Bomberman Party Edition's background music is simply atrocious. Remixing the old Bomberman themes is one thing, but giving them a Muzak twinge is cruel and unusual punishment. Still, Bomberman has never been about visuals or sound, so Bomberman Party Edition doesn't stumble too badly."", ""Despite its unusually deficient single-player mode, Bomberman Party Edition still manages to succeed where many previous attempts have failed, delivering an uproariously enjoyable multiplayer experience. With the popularity of party titles such as Mario Party and Crash Bash, Vatical is obviously aiming to offer this subset of gamers another alternative for their group-gaming dollar. Thanks to its less than modern visuals, Bomberman Party Edition may not make the same overwhelming first impression that competing efforts achieve, but if you give it a minute or two, you'll likely find the addiction known as Bomberman has you in its grasp.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc.

From a purely critical standpoint, it's difficult to see what's so compelling to gamers about a series of games that have typically suffered from poor programming, shoddy control, and uninspired gameplay.  Perhaps critics miss the point, though - the series' continued popularity and decent sales record proves that there are a substantial amount of gamers who appreciate the nostalgic kick Army Men tries to impart. The games are slowly getting better, too. As Army Men: Air Combat proved earlier this year, all the series needs is a bit more spit and polish to earn its stripes."", ""This sets an interesting stage for the series' next installment, Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2 for the PS2.

It's up to you to help Sarge, Vikki, and the Green Army combat the foreign encroachers and maintain peace in the land."", ""Even if you're unfamiliar with the Army Men series, you can correctly guess that all of the games' 18 missions take place in the confines of a realistically scaled world. This means that the levels will take you to such exotic locales as desktops, pool tables, a toy store, a graveyard, the underside of a bed, and the inside of a pinball machine. Sarge's Heroes 2 features the ability to play as either Sarge or Vikki, who both have their own unique control and abilities. Like in the original, weapons are of primary importance for survival. Sarge's Heroes 2 gives you more choices in this department as well, promising the basics that range from the assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle to more extravagant death dealers like the flamethrower, M-60 machine gun, and grenade launcher. Army Men also gives you options beyond the barreled weapons, with minesweepers, mines, TNT, mortars, and the ability to call for help from the air cavalry being thrown into the armament melting pot."", ""Certainly, Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2 will look better than any Army Men game to date. The big question, though, is whether or not it'll be able to tap the enormous potential of the PlayStation 2's processors. We can assume that frame rate issues, which have plagued almost all of the 3D Army Men titles to date, shouldn't be a problem here. Resolution will be high - expect intricate, detailed scenes to be pulled off without a hitch.  Unfortunately, 3DO seemingly prefers to show off the game's many promises through rendered pictures rather than any actual screenshots, so it's difficult to offer much insight into how the game's visuals will finally turn out. Certainly, a lack of legitimate screenshots combined with a rapidly approaching release date isn't a good sign."", ""Obviously, time will tell whether or not Army Men: Sarge's Heroes will continue the positive upswing Army Men: Air Command provided to the series. With the power of a state-of-the-art console behind it, 3DO has a golden opportunity to further redeem the Army Men lineage in the eyes of many gamers."", ""Look for Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2 sometime late in Q3 2000 on PS2s everywhere.<i>--Chris Kirchgasler</i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc.

Outlaws (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['In <i>Outlaws</i>, you are the embodiment of the loner who rides into town seeking vengeance and uncovers the twisted plot of a powerful railroad baron and his outlaw thugs. <i>Outlaws</i> is a hybrid of strategic action-adventure and network play in an intense and graphically rich environment.', 'Weren\'t so long ago that the Spirit of Digital Western Gaming roamed these plains, moanin\' and cussin\' something fierce about getting no respect. Mayhap he didn\'t rightly deserve much - you might remember Sunset Riders or maybe Mad Dog McCree - mere tinkles in the comprehensive wind of the Western genre - and what else comes to mind? Dust, maybe (a fine game, but a little too Nice, and you can guess what happens to ""Nice"" out these ways). Still, the lack of true Western computer games was a crime, a terrible crime. <P> Now comes Outlaws, and there just ain\'t room enough in this town for anybody else. <P> In Outlaws, you don the duds and irons of the archetypal Avenging Loner who rides into town seeking to redress the wrongs committed by a railroad tycoon and his renegade thugs. Using both the 3D engine from the popular Dark Forces and Rebel Assualt II\'s INSANE engine, Outlaws combines all the elements of classic 1960s Leone-esque Westerns in a first-person shooter that is probably the first point-of-view crawler since Marathon with an actual, articulated plot. <P> You take the role of ex-marshal James Anderson, whose life is shattered by vicious desperados who murder his wife and kidnap his daughter, leading the determined hero on an avenging, unshaven kill spree through a prairie stronghold, a lethal sun-battered township with the unlikely name of Sanctuary, a clattering, swaying-car passenger train, and more. Inspired by such films as A Fistful of Dollars and other spaghetti westerns, Outlaws is a respectable step forward in the first-person shooter genre; even the gorgeous and gloomy Quake had only the lamest excuse for a plot. Not so with Outlaws, where in the middle of a tense back-room shoot-out the game will suddenly cut to an animated cinematic sequence which moves the story, and the motivations of the player, along. <P> From the opening level, you\'ll know you\'re in for a movie-worthy experience. The Western alone (with the possible exception of the noir gumshoe film) is a genre which not only embraces cliches but actually seems to improve with them, and they are all, every one of them, here: The greedy, amoral railroad baron makes his debut within the opening movie; the chugging, desolate Western music (which seems at times to have been lifted whole-cloth from Ennio Morricone\'s soundtracks) gives an unmistakable Leone-esque tang to the wide-open skies, dusty streets and grungy buildings of some skanky desert way station crawling with gunslingers of low moral character; bartop bottles and expensive plate glass windows don\'t fare well in the vicinity of saloons or anywhere else, and inventory icons take the form of the fanned playing cards one might find in such dens of sin; every counting-house, feed store, and livery stable has a back door, a hidden room, or a secret rifleman\'s niche, ideally suited for the dirty-dealing desperado who wants a clean view of Main Street in case the hero decides to walk down it (the rifle-scope, a nifty and dirty little piece of coding, affords the player a small, magnified patch of distant, crosshaired scenery through which to deal his brand of frontier justice); even the boiler-plate trick perpetrated by Clint the Great and Squinty-Eyed is here (and if you don\'t know what I\'m talking about, stop reading my review this instant). <P> LucasArts knew that if it didn\'t make this one multiplayer (some fans still say Dark Forces with an inflection of resentment), it would get fire-bombed. Well, it\'s multiplayer - up to eight over modem, network, or Internet to be precise. There\'s something mighty fine, special, and personal about loading your six-shooter two shells at a time with your own fingers, ka-chik ka-chick ka-chik, before gunning down your friends through a barred jail window at two hundred paces. <P> To reiterate: The buffet at the Badass Western Computer Gaming table is slim pickins \'ceptin one game. Outlaws is it, pardner - the main stick, the top gun, the most complete and faithful Old West shooter in the industry to date. The bad guys in western cliches are always givin\' you \'til sundown, but don\'t be surprised if you find yourself playing this one \'til sunrise. <I>--Chris Hudak</I> <BR> <i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Pandora's Box: Puzzle Game of the Year Edition - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""When Alexey Pajitnov, creator of <I>Tetris</I> (one of the most addictive games of all time), designs a new puzzle title, fans everywhere perk their heads up and take note. While it's not quite up to the irresistible standard set by its legendary predecessor, Microsoft's <I>Pandora's Box: Puzzle Game of the Year Edition</I> was named Puzzle Game of the Year by the Electric Games website, and offers hours of nonviolent, uncomplicated enjoyment through its 10 different types of puzzles."", ""Nearly all of the <I>Pandora's Box</I> conundrums resemble the traditional jigsaw puzzle, though you'll find plenty of visual twists, such as sliding pieces on a circular plane or having to solve a puzzle built on a complex 3-D object. Some deviate from this formula, but the most addictive puzzles follow this model, and those provide the most extended--and replayable--diversions."", ""For those overwhelmed by complex computer games, <I>Pandora's Box: Puzzle Game of the Year Edition</I> offers a simplistic interface and basic rules, easing computer novices into the puzzle environment. This edition features 40 new puzzle games, as well as the original 350 puzzles from the original <I>Pandora's Box</I>. There are five difficulty levels, plus various hints and wildcards that remove the frustration factor when you're unable to complete a particular puzzle. Looking for new puzzle games to replace your <I>Tetris</I> addiction? Check out Alexey Pajitnov's engrossing <I>Pandora's Box: Puzzle Game of the Year Edition</I>. <I>--Doug Radcliffe</I>"", ""Alexei Pajitnov's name will forever be linked to Tetris, arguably the best puzzle game of all time. Luckily, the accomplishment of designing what is probably the most addictive game ever overshadows his recent track record, which includes mediocre selections such as Microsoft Puzzle Collection and a string of mediocre games for MicroProse, including Knight Moves and Qwirks, a poor PC adaptation of the excellent Puyo Puyo."", ""Pajitnov's latest, Pandora's Box, is a welcome return to form. While not quite as mind-and-finger-numbingly addictive as the game he is famous for, it still makes for a fun diversion."", ""Pandora's Box isn't actually a single game, but rather a collection of ten different puzzle types. For the most part, each type is a variation on the jigsaw puzzle, and some are more fun than others. In each puzzle, you must arrange the pieces to complete a picture or an object. What the pieces are, and what you need to do to arrange them properly, differs from puzzle to puzzle."", 'The puzzle types themselves range from renovated versions of old favorites, such as Rotoscope, a circular slider puzzle, to innovative variations like Outer Layer, which requires you to place the textures on a 3D object such as a vase or a sculpture. Other puzzles types are a bit more typical. Overlap is a straightforward jigsaw puzzle; the only difference is that the pieces can, as the name suggests, overlap. Slices is simply a vertical jigsaw puzzle that requires you to stack pieces of a 3D object. And Focus Point, the best of the lot, requires you to assemble out-of-focus pieces of an image.', ""There are also two puzzle types that stray from the jigsaw formula. Image Hole, probably the least interesting puzzle in the game, involves a covered picture. Shapes move around the board, revealing the image as they pass over. Your goal is to line up the shape with its corresponding portion of the picture underneath. It sounds interesting, but the shapes are too vague to make it anything more than frustrating most of the time. The other non-jigsaw puzzle is Find and Fill. In this puzzle, you are presented with a picture with sections missing and a separate jumble of shapes. You must use a simple paint program to find and fill the shapes that are missing from the picture. It's fun, but the picture that's provided for reference is so tiny the puzzle often ends up being nothing more than a guessing game."", 'What makes Pandora\'s Box more interesting than just a puzzle anthology is its attempt to give meaning to the proceedings. The story follows the basics of the Greek myth from which the game takes its name. Pandora has unleashed chaos - in the form of seven trickster gods - into the world, and you must recapture them. To do this, you must solve puzzles. What\'s intriguing is that the jigsaw nature of the puzzles fits the theme somewhat - you must restore order to chaos by piecing together fragments of puzzles into a whole - and your overall sense of purpose, even if it\'s the most basic ""find the stuff"" premise, is rare for the genre.', ""You must capture the seven tricksters: mythological and religious figures such as Eris, Puck, and Coyote. You pursue each of them to several cities, each of which has ten puzzles. Under one of the puzzles is a piece of the box. There are four pieces associated with each of these mischievous spirits, and once you have obtained all four pieces from one, you then go after the trickster himself. Once you've captured him, you move on to the next trickster, the next set of cities, and the next set of puzzles. There's a lot to do and a lot of puzzles to solve. The escalating difficulty and the slow introduction of new puzzle types help to keep things interesting."", ""Pandora's Box isn't the Half-Life of puzzle games, but it is revolutionary in a sense. It's not only a great way to divert yourself for short periods of time, but the overall sense of accomplishment you'll feel when you complete a series of its puzzles makes it something you'll go back to time and time again. And while the individual pieces may be a bit weak on their own, the overall experience is satisfying and worthwhile.<i>--Ron Dulin</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The plot--which casts the player as an amnesiac who survives a  helicopter crash only to find himself in a foreboding town swarming with zombies  and other hideous biotechnological mutations--is more of a side story to the  <i>Resident Evil</i> saga, and not a very interesting one at that.

The original Dynasty Warriors is a fighting game for the PlayStation, but the sequel offers a mixed collection of action and strategy-simulation elements."", ""Dynasty Warriors 2 is based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, in which three kingdoms - Wei, Wu, and Shu - battle each other in China during the second century. Much like in Sega's Spikeout and Yukes' Sword of the Berserk, you'll control a character in a fight against thousands of enemies in a 3D polygonal environment. Initially, you will be able to choose from one of nine characters (three from each kingdom) who all serve as the leading generals of their respective kingdoms. You can unlock about a dozen playable characters upon finishing the game. The health, attack, and defense parameters of each character vary at the start of the game, but ultimately the range of attack (determined by the different weapons) and the fighting style are the only things that differ. The control scheme is straightforward, consisting of jump, attack, and Musou (special attack) buttons. Tapping the attack button two times allows for air combos, three times to stun enemies, and four times for a chain combo. The L1 button is also helpful, since it allows for blocking, strafing, and immediately changing the camera angle to match the direction your player is facing. You can also switch to first-person mode to shoot arrows, which is a handy technique for attacking enemies from a safe distance."", ""At the beginning of every stage, a map of the battlefield is displayed with the locations and quantities of troops from your kingdom's battalion, as well as those of the enemy. A little bit of strategy helps in playing the game, but as your level increases, you can pretty much overpower enemies all by yourself. Cutting off enemy lines to prevent them from calling in reinforcements and defeating enemy generals to decrease morale are the fastest ways to increase your level and finish the stages quickly. The game is fun and exciting when playing the first two stages, but the game's difficulty increases pretty sharply in the third stage.  Luckily, in addition to the main quest mode, the game features a free mode, which lets you replay stages you've already cleared and level up your character in the process. However, the game is repetitive enough as it is, and with only five stages, it can get old fast. There is also an intro edit mode, which lets you place your favorite characters in different scenes in the opening demo, much like in Namco's Soul Calibur."", ""While you can always find your troops in the field, it seems like your comrades just stand in one area and don't help you in battles more often than not. It's as if they are waiting for you to clear up the front line so they can position themselves further into the enemy territory. Even a simple summon command would have helped. The other concern is that enemy bosses have a tendency to cheat. After being knocked down with a chain combo, they tend to use items to replenish health or to increase attack or defense.  You, however, can do that only when you pick up an item from defeated enemies or when you destroy things like crates."", 'Despite some concerns, the game happens to be one of the most efficient among the PS2 games so far, as the frame rate stays at a constant rate of 60fps. Although the early version of the game had us worried, the final version successfully cut down the slowdown, which now occurs very rarely. It is also a demonstration of how powerful the PS2 hardware is, displaying dozens of soldiers on one screen. There are CG cutscenes with voice-overs between each stage as well, adding plot details. The music is mainly heavy metal rock, and, despite the cool opening intro sequence, the in-game music gets really redundant after a while.', ""Dynasty Warriors 2's beat-'em-up gameplay is simple enough to make it easy to get in to, and the game is interesting enough to keep you entertained for a while.

Create your own unique battles with a fully functional campaign generator and a map editor, ensuring customization for infinite replayability.', ""Your typical game developer specializes at a particular genre, leaving New World Computing as an uncommon exception that excels on not one but two fronts. Best known for its long running Might and Magic role-playing series, New World has since created the offshoot Heroes of Might and Magic turn-based strategy series, which has nearly eclipsed its role-playing progenitor with the sheer amount of critical and popular acclaim it's earned. It's no coincidence - the Heroes formula is one of the most brilliant strategy game designs ever conceived, with its careful blend of micro- and macromanagement within a distinctive fantasy setting. And so, the big question with Heroes of Might and Magic III is whether the formula is good enough to hold up three games in a row. After all, while Heroes III overhauls the appearance and otherwise expands upon its predecessors, its gameplay remains fundamentally similar. Nevertheless, spending even a short time with the game quells any doubt that it's anything but an excellent sequel and a first-rate strategy game in its own right. But you'll notice its new look before everything else."", ""The first two games were especially notable for their colorful storybook-style graphics, which lent either one a quirky sense of humor in spite of the epic subject. You'd witness hundreds of peasants being slaughtered by, for instance, a pack of minotaurs. But because both the peasants and the minotaurs looked silly, and because their numbers were graphically abstracted onscreen with just a single unit representing the army, it was difficult to take the combat too seriously."", ""Even though it plays about the same, a veteran of the first two Heroes games will initially suspect that Heroes of Might and Magic III is a departure from the series because of its face-lift. Specifically, it tries to look a little more serious. Many of the units seem more dangerous than before, and at first, the look can put you off. The 3D-rendered units seem to lack some of the charm and character of the previous games, in part because the higher resolution graphics mean all the creatures appear smaller onscreen than before. Still, further inspection reveals that the old flame still burns - just take a look at the new units like the devils (complete with scythes, ram horns, and sideburns) or the behemoths (lots of hair, teeth, and claws) and you'll see that the series still retains its trademark sense of humor."", 'While not all of the monsters in Heroes III look interesting, most of its graphics are beautiful, especially for a genre that typically neglects its appearance for the sake of gameplay. Heroes of Might and Magic III sounds even more impressive, with incredible and well-suited orchestral themes for each castle, although the operatic vocals from Heroes II are conspicuously absent.', ""The turn-based gameplay has you recruiting mercenary heroes, whom you then guide about an overhead map jam-packed with resources, treasure, magical artifacts, mysterious landmarks, monsters, and more. Using the resources your heroes acquire, you augment your towns so that they can produce more powerful units, or still more resources. Meanwhile your heroes gain experience, skills, and spells, and you put them in command of the largest armies that you can afford in an ultimate effort to defeat the enemy mercenaries looking to conquer you first. As your heroes earn experience through combat and exploration, you'll want to utilize some for castle sieges, while others will make far better scouts or magic users. All the while, you need to balance resources between recruiting new troops and heroes, and building new facilities in your castles."", ""Half the game is spent exploring and building, and the other half is spent in battle. The overhead map switches to a side view when you engage in combat, at which point you must command your various creatures against their enemies, taking turns moving unit stacks one by one depending on their speed. You can have up to seven types of creatures serving under a hero (as opposed to five in the previous games), with seven unique creatures available in each of the eight castles. Every creature can also be upgraded, making it more powerful yet more expensive to recruit. Each castle is meticulously balanced, and although the units roughly correlate between castles, most of them are unique. In fact, many of the creatures (both old and new) now have special abilities; archangels can resurrect their fallen comrades, unicorns create a defensive anti-magic aura, and cavaliers deal more damage if they charge their target. Combat plays out simply, but a great deal of complexity lies beneath the surface, as your hero's attributes and spells tend to sway the course of a battle."", ""The single player game spans six campaigns detailing the war to claim the kingdom of Erathia from the perspective of good, evil, and mercenary leaders alike. The story isn't played up too much, but the campaign missions themselves are well designed and appear deceptively small. In fact, many contain subterranean caverns as well as the usual overworld territory, often demanding hundreds of turns across many hours of play. And if you can finish the campaigns, you still have dozens of single player maps to try, with the promise of many more to come thanks to the map editor included with the game. Meanwhile, Heroes III is a much better multiplayer game than its predecessors, as you can scroll around the map and review your forces when it's not your turn."", ""Heroes of Might and Magic III doesn't alter the formula set forth by its ancestors, but represents a refinement and improvement on caliber with the finest sequels ever released. The promise of much more of everything - heroes, castles, creatures, artifacts, skills, spells - is gracefully accomplished so as to accentuate the game's complexity, style, and strategy without making it feel excessive. Much like its predecessors, Heroes of Might and Magic III successfully combines a number of elements that are enjoyable and accessible on their own, but when combined and weighed as a whole, they add up to a game that's both entertaining and rewarding.<i>--Greg Kasavin</i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc.

NO MANUAL. Disc may have a few small scratches but nothing that affects gameplay. Case may show average wear from age and usage. All CassicGameStore games are tested before being placed into inventory.', ""Eternal Ring marks From Software's first attempt at the first-person action-RPG genre for the PlayStation2. The game's opening sequence begins with the main character - an adventurer named Cain Morgan - walking through a palace surrounded by water. He notices a glowing object on one of the pedestals and picks up a ring. A dragon immediately swoops down out of the sky, preparing to attack. Cain raises his arms high above his head to ward it off, and the ring blasts the dragon with tremendous force, destroying it utterly. Yes, you're going to want to get more of these rings."", ""The game itself begins with a narration introducing the character Cain and a background story using a series of pictures that are drawn in a style reminiscent of medieval art. After the narration, you see Cain on a sailboat heading toward an island. Cain and the boatman begin a brief conversation, which you expect to be voiced-over since the narration featured voice, but unfortunately they aren't. Instead you just see characters opening their mouths and moving their lips as the dialogue text scrolls on the bottom of the screen. Despite some lackluster sound effects and the absence of voice-overs, the game's soundtrack does manage to set an appropriate mood and atmosphere of the game."", ""Eternal Ring runs at a faster frame rate than From Software's previous first-person RPGs (King's Field, King's Field II, and Shadow Tower), which clocked in at 15 to 20 frames per second. In the beginning, your movement is relatively slow, but once you obtain a special object from the first boss, you're able to move faster, and the rate becomes satisfactory."", ""The graphics in Eternal Ring are a leap from its PlayStation predecessors, but there is still room for improvement. Considering that some of the most recent PS titles (such as Vagrant Story) have been visual marvels, one can't help noticing that the graphics on this PS2 game could've been better. For instance, the faces on many of the characters are very plain. On the other hand, the environments, though not incredibly populated, are really well done. The waterfall inside the caverns and the transitions from daytime to sunset to nightfall really are very impressive looking. The biggest mistake in the game's graphics is the collision detection. When enemies throw projectiles like a stone or even magic spells, your instinct is to hide behind a wall or an object to avoid getting hit. Unfortunately, these projectiles or magic spells go through walls, so you still get hit by them.If you have played From Software's previous first-person RPGs, you'll have an idea as to how Eternal Ring plays - for the most part. The game uses a first-person perspective, and you, as Cain, use a variety of weapons and magic spells to defeat your foes, though more of the latter than the former since the only weapons in this game are swords and you will not come across a whole lot of them. Instead, the game focuses more on the usage of magical spells. While you had a gauge for both weapons and magic spells in King's Field, only magic spells are available in Eternal Ring. The gauge indicates the charge time to cast spells. Magic spells can be obtained by equipping up to ten rings. More than 120 different kinds of spells can be created by producing different combinations of the rings' elemental jewels. Other rings may not provide you with magic spells but instead may enhance your abilities, such as increasing your stats. There are countless combinations for creating rings that have magic spells, and you could spend endless hours trying to complete the entire set. In that sense, there is potential for replay value."", ""The Dual Shock 2 controller features analog buttons, including the D-pad. The default setting in the game has the analog buttons turned off, and the sensitivity is on 5 (on a scale of 1 to 10). It's really quite necessary to have the analog button turned on and the sensitivity at 1. This makes movements much smoother and faster during gameplay, and you don't have to press the buttons as hard as you do in the default setting. Tapping the attack button during a fight supposedly induces lesser damage compared with pressing the attack button, but the difference was hardly noticeable."", ""The gameplay though has not changed much since the creation of King's Field, and if you are an expert at the game, then the usual routine of strafing around enemies in a circle and slashing enemies as you approach them still works in Eternal Ring. If you have experience with previous From Software titles, you will probably finish the game in 10 to 15 hours. As you may expect from this genre developed by From Software, there is a good story integrated into the game, but somehow your character, Cain, lacks personality and the ability to interact with the rest of the characters in the game. For instance, in one case Cain watches a man getting killed by a monster and doesn't react in any way."", ""With more development time, From Software could have polished this game much more, but instead it has arrived feeling rushed. Eternal Ring is definitely a leap from its previous title Shadow Tower and is promising what King's Field IV may offer in the future, but it's certainly not the type of game that pleases every gamer. Avid fans of King's Field and Shadow Tower will likely love Eternal Ring, but others may want to try the game out first.<i>--Ike Sato</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Sky Odyssey,,['Combination of futuristic and old-school flying'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation 2', 'Games']",{},"[""Soar into the wild blue yonder, braving ever-changing weather conditions as to earn your pilot's wings in Sky Odyssey. Undertake over 40 diverse and challenging missions as you navigate underground caverns, rescue a wayward hot air balloon and fly through waterfalls. Complete missions and retrieve missing pieces of an ancient map that, once completed, will lead to the game's final destination."", ""Much like Nintendo's seminal Pilotwings, Sky Odyssey blends aspects of flight simulation with an easy to pick up but difficult to master gameplay system. It also brings a light adventure story to the table, and the crux of the gameplay is focused on the completion of real-world tasks, as opposed to the predominantly acrobatic dealings of Pilotwings. While similarities exist between the two titles, Activision's Sky Odyssey is not a Pilotwings clone, but instead a truly excellent game in its own right."", ""There is no shortage of gameplay modes in Sky Odyssey. There are free flight, target, and sky canvas modes, all of which are noteworthy. The real meaty center of the game, however, is its adventure mode. This mode puts you on a chain of islands where you must complete a string of missions, each with its own set of goals, which vary wildly from mission to mission. For example, in one mission you'll fly into an underground cavern and make a water landing at an ancient ruin in order to recover a piece of a lost map, while the next will have you flying from point A to point B and negotiating a midair refueling along the way. The maps themselves share the same eclectic nature as the mission objectives, ranging from rolling countrysides and high-walled ravines to underground caves and the eye of a thunderstorm. And these maps are big. The missions can take anywhere from five to 20 minutes to complete, giving the 18-mission adventure mode a fair amount of length. One of the game's few real rubs is its sheer difficulty - Sky Odyssey is by no account an easy game. Normal and easy modes are included, but most levels will require at least two tries before completing them successfully, even in easy mode. This can prove to be occasionally frustrating, but the constant variety in mission goals, combined with the variety and magnitude of the maps, will certainly keep you engrossed and eagerly awaiting the next mission."", ""Of course, all this would be for naught if the gameplay weren't worthwhile, and Sky Odyssey really delivers in this department.  There is a plethora of aircraft you can fly, such as vintage biplanes, experimental military planes, helicopters, and UFOs.  Each aircraft controls differently and can be customized with different wings, tails, propellers, engines, and just about anything else you could imagine. These customizations have a pretty significant impact, as some missions are impassible without modifying a specific component of your craft. The developers keep things interesting by constantly mixing up the weather effects, which are nothing short of outstanding. Headwinds, tailwinds, updrafts, downdrafts, turbulence - there is no shortage of weather in Sky Odyssey, and your aircraft of choice reacts very realistically to it, forcing you to navigate your flights based not only on physical obstacles, but also on the constantly shifting weather conditions."", ""If there is an outstanding flaw in Sky Odyssey, it's in the graphics. What makes it especially disappointing is that the game has some spectacular visuals but gets hung up in the particulars. The planes are modeled true to their real-world counterparts, the environments are all well designed and a pleasure to look at, and the different effects - such as rain, snow, and the vapor trails that come off your wings - are the kinds of details that really make for an immersive game. The problems come when the game's great design and the PS2 hardware collide, as Sky Odyssey has all the telltale signs of an unoptimized PS2 game. It suffers from a heavy amount of aliasing, and the draw-in distance is closer than it should be and is only sporadically camouflaged with fog. There is also occasional slowdown, usually during a major onscreen events, such as a rockslide. These blemishes keep Sky Odyssey from being a truly spectacular game."", ""Sky Odyssey is not a game for everyone - the slow-paced missions and the flight simulation influences will turn away those looking for pure arcade action. But those that are willing to overlook the game's graphical imperfections and can grapple with its relatively steep learning curve will be rewarded with a fully satisfying game experience. <br>  <i>--Ryan Davis</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc.

No One Lives Forever - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<I>No One Lives Forever</I> is a story-driven, first-person adventure delivering over-the-top action, tense subterfuge, outrageous villains, and wry humor in the tradition of the great 1960s spy films and TV shows. Players assume the role of Agent Archer, an operative working for a covert anticrime organization. Armed with an assortment of conventional and experimental weaponry and gadgets, players explore exotic locales and contend with deadly agents as they evade traps, unravel mysteries, and become entangled in a cleverly constructed conspiracy that threatens the entire free world.', 'Just when it seemed as if first-person shooters had run out of ideas, along comes No One Lives Forever to reinvigorate the genre. Two years after the release of Half-Life, a first-person shooter has finally arrived that\'s so stylish, so ingenious, so well written, so well acted, and otherwise so great that this review won\'t have to include the expression ""it\'s no Half-Life"" - except for right there. No One Lives Forever takes the impressive enemy artificial intelligence of Half-Life, the stealth features of Thief: The Dark Project, and the gadgetry of the console shooter GoldenEye 007 and then combines them all with a unique, colorful \'60s setting and a great sense of humor. The resulting game\'s unrelenting inventiveness shows in virtually every aspect of its design.', ""Although you might expect that it's somehow inspired by Austin Powers, No One Lives Forever's inspirations actually seem to be drawn simply from the same cultural well as the Mike Myers comedy. The game's plot is part Avengers and part Our Man Flint, with a little Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs thrown in for good measure. The story itself isn't especially engaging: The good guys, an international antiterrorist organization called U.N.I.T.Y., attempt to foil the world-domination plans of the bad guys, a mysteriously well-funded group of homicidal lunatics called H.A.R.M. But this simple plot acts as a framework on which the designers have strung a great number of brilliantly absurd details."", ""Someone at Monolith had the bright idea to portray the cutscenes in the game using cinematic flair, rather than with bland camera angles typical of most games. By locking the camera down and framing each shot as if it really were from a movie, the designers have given the game a singular look that really sets it apart from the competition. The acting in No One Lives Forever is so good and the dialogue is often so sharp that it'll cast a pall over your memory of previous action games and might even ruin your experience with future shooters that are any less impressive."", ""Thankfully, the gameplay in No One Lives Forever is every bit a match for the execution of its story. The game includes close to 60 levels spread over 15 diverse and often brightly lit and colorful environments. Expect to spend more than 20 hours finishing the single-player game. The action alternates between missions in which shooting at things is the primary goal and levels wherein the game's heroine, Cate Archer, must sneak undetected from one place to another. Some missions combine the two elements in surprising ways. True to the game's spy theme, stealth is always rewarded, even though it's not always strictly required. At the end of every level, you're ranked on your performance, and a large part of your score is based on remaining unseen."", ""Unlike many other shooters before it, No One Lives Forever never settles into a boring routine. After a few more-standard shooting or sneaking sequences, the game always adds an interesting twist. It's a testament to the game's ingenuity that to describe the setting or action of many of the levels would spoil a lot of the fun of experiencing these sequences for the first time. But to give you some idea of what to expect, here's a description of just the very first mission. You must protect a clueless yet surly ambassador from assassins as he stumbles around the streets of Morocco. First you'll stand at a window and snipe enemies as they appear at various spots in a building across the street. Then you must sneak to another room, without alerting any civilians to your presence, where you set up a new sniper nest for another round of protecting the ambassador. Once you've finished this sequence, your room is besieged by a group of thugs, and a wild, close-quarters gunfight ensues. This is all in the first level of 60."", ""Every gunfight in No One Lives Forever is very exciting thanks to the game's truly outstanding artificial intelligence for enemy characters. For starters, you won't ever witness an enemy running in place or bumping into things as in many other shooters. It's almost startling to realize just how much of an effect that one detail can have on your sense of immersion in the gameworld. But the developers have done much more than rectify that problem. Namely, your enemies actually appear to care whether or not they live or die. In large groups, they'll assault you head-on. But alone or in pairs, they'll often run for cover and then switch position if they notice you've moved. They'll knock furniture over to hide behind, they'll stoop down to investigate the bodies of their dead coworkers, and they'll even hunker down behind tables, stick their weapons over their heads, and spray suppressing gunfire blindly at you. The enemy behavior seems to be partially scripted, but replaying a battle using different tactics will often result in different enemy actions. What adds to the illusion that you're taking on real, live opponents is that you'll frequently sneak up on henchman engaged in long, often hilarious discussions to pass the time while going about their tedious jobs. These conversations range from a critical reevaluation of the Edsel to an argument over correlation versus causality as it relates to beer consumption among criminals. Delivered in a deadpan style that perfectly matches the dialogue, these ancillary conversations are one of the best parts of the game. You'll replay levels simply to hear dialogue you may have missed by alerting the guards to your presence."", ""The motion-captured animation of the game's characters is also top-notch. Although there aren't a huge number of different character models, they're so well animated that they can express emotion through body language alone. And you'll notice other impressive details such as how enemies killed at the top of stairways will actually come tumbling down. It's true that the characters in No One Lives Forever don't take damage in so many ways as in Soldier of Fortune; you can't vivisect them into forty bloody pieces. But a single head shot will usually take an enemy down, and chest hits appear to be more damaging than targeting a limb, all of which is more than enough to reward accuracy over wild shooting."", ""The graphics in No One Lives Forever are powered by the newest version of Monolith's Lithtech engine. It seems a little less technologically advanced than either the Unreal Tournament or Quake III Arena engines. There are no curved or reflective surfaces on display, and items you'll find throughout the game frequently appear blocky. But it's hardly an issue. Regardless of how many triangles the engine is spitting out, the art direction in No One Lives Forever is spectacular, and the graphics are colorful and always interesting. The game even saves and loads data quickly, unlike other recent Lithtech-engine games."", ""The game's sound effects and '60s-era music are excellent as well. Different game actions have different themes, which actually segue from one piece to another without a jarring jump cut. It's a subtle effect that's one of many other features that make No One Lives Forever seem so polished."", ""To live up to the single-player game, the multiplayer experience of No One Lives Forever would have to be pretty spectacular. In short, it's not, though there's nothing really wrong with it either. There's a built-in game finder, plenty of character models to choose from, four deathmatch levels, and six maps designed for a capture-the-flag variant called U.N.I.T.Y. versus H.A.R.M. The problem is that most of the elements that make the single-player game special - the acting, the dialogue, the sneaking, and the precisely orchestrated gun battles - are simply absent from the multiplayer game. However, the multiplayer mode does have a few interesting elements. For instance, motorcycles and snowmobiles are provided to help you traverse a couple of the larger maps. But ultimately, there isn't a lot to differentiate the multiplayer component of No One Lives Forever from that of most other shooters."", 'Whatever minor problems or shortcomings there are in No One Lives Forever are dwarfed by the technical expertise and sheer creativity that went into it. The fact is that Monolith Productions has finally delivered an undeniably superlative action game.<i>--Erik Wolpaw</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

For the first time, the surreal world of <I>Myst</I> can be experienced in full 3-D. Swaying trees and independently roaming animals add life to the formerly static <I>Myst</I> worlds. The <I>realMYST</I> game includes the complete original <I>Myst</I> game, along with an all-new fifth age, called the Rime Age, which provides a complete ending to the original mystery."", ""For those unfamiliar with <I>Myst</I>, it is one of the primary reasons your computer has a CD-ROM drive. CD-ROM drives didn't really catch on as must-have components until <I>Myst</I> debuted in 1993. Since then, the game has sold more than 9 million copies and still appears on bestseller charts."", 'The <I>realMYST</I> game takes place in a beautiful, interactive virtual world. The player must solve puzzles and roam magical realms filled with archaic technology in order to solve an ancient mystery.', 'The game realMYST is a noble attempt by Cyan to update its popular adventure game Myst. The title is meant to imply that this is the ""real"" version of Myst, the version the Rand brothers would have originally created had the technology been available. The major change is the game\'s 3D engine: It lets you walk around the island and the different ages in real time. The game also includes a new epilogue that links it to its sequel, Riven. Unfortunately, the 3D engine serves only to make Myst a much more frustrating game.', 'The Myst phenomenon is well known. The Rand brothers, after creating the moderately successful games Cosmo Osmo and The Manhole, released an artistically ornate yet technically simple adventure game that put you on a mysterious deserted island. Through the writings of the former inhabitant, a man named Atrus, and some brief interactions with his two sons, you pieced together the history of the island.', 'Myst became a huge bestseller and reportedly sold around 10 million copies. It was available for any and every platform, and it rode the top of the best-selling-games lists for years. Most of the initial sales were through word of mouth, and the game even became a hit among people who normally wouldn\'t play computer games. Myst inspired dozens of similar games, including Sierra\'s Lighthouse and Rocket Science\'s underappreciated Obsidian. But as a result of its popularity, there was the inevitable backlash. The name ""Myst"" became synonymous with nonserious gaming, and it was considered by many to be the ""pet rock"" of computer games - a fad that had no real intrinsic value.', ""There's one significant fact that's often overlooked amid all the fervor surrounding Myst: It was a really good game when it was released. Its series of static images may have been simple, but the story and setting were great. Reading Atrus' lengthy and detailed writings gave the worlds the life that the technical shortcomings were unable to. And the puzzles were generally logical and fun, unlike those in so many of the games Myst inspired."", 'For the most part, realMYST is exactly the same game as Myst. The puzzles are the same, and the books are the same. The major difference is the new 3D engine, which not only lets you move through the environments but also allows for the inclusion of animation in the otherwise static surroundings. Windmills turn, birds and butterflies dot the landscape, and the water flows realistically. Visually, the engine is superb. Everything looks great, and the water effects are especially noteworthy. Ripples form around pillars, and boats bob over waves.', ""Unfortunately, the benefits of the new engine are limited to the visuals. The control interface borrows from first-person shooters - you use either the arrow keys or the mouse to move. But there are two real problems with this: Trying to manipulate objects in the world using your mouse often makes you move instead, and there's no way to change the options so that control is limited to just the arrow keys. And turning is a nightmare - you just hurtle around with little precision."", ""The other problem with the engine, and probably the biggest problem with realMYST in general, is that the engine runs slowly. You'll find the game constantly dragging as the engine shudders under the weight of everything it's attempting to render. The problems exist even with the visuals set to the lowest quality. And playing the game at high resolutions is almost impossible, even on a relatively fast system."", 'The puzzles suffer as a result. Some timed puzzles that were originally just mind benders have now become sadistic battles between you and your keyboard. Even simple point-and-click puzzles are now tedious, as they force you to try to get the mouse pointer in exactly the right position as it slowly lurches around the screen. And you might get sent hurtling through a door when you were just trying to close it.', ""With some serious updates to the engine, realMYST would serve as a modern reminder that the original was an impressive game that was equally defined by both its fascinating detail and its original story. In its current form, realMYST is suitable only as a novelty for fans of the original, who will want to see the new epilogue. You still have to listen to Atrus' speech at the end, but afterward you're given a new age to visit and some new puzzles. The epilogue serves as a more comprehensive link to Riven, though it's still somewhat open-ended and lacks the conclusiveness you want when a game is finished. It may be a novelty, but it's still a mostly worthwhile one for those who fondly remember Myst.<i>--Ron Dulin</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The furnishings are mostly grouped by theme, with the medieval dungeon option the most authoritative of the bunch. (Little Cassandra Goth has been <i>longing</i> to read by torch light all along.)', ""Our personal favorite is the futuristic theme, with an optional, but expensive, maid/gardener robot to take care of the fabulous modern furnishings. Clearly the Sims team has been doing its research over at Herman Miller, and you'll have a bright red, flowing-foam sofa to show for it."", 'But it wouldn\'t be <i>The Sims</i> if only good taste prevailed. Bring on the mai tais with a tiki-heavy islander theme. There\'s also a startling collection of carpeting and objects best grouped under the design ideal we call ""demented clown.""', ""The attention-getting rarities include: a lame fortune-telling ball (our advice mostly centered around hiring a maid), a voodoo doll for hexing roommates, and a genie who delivers as much bad as good (dead plants, anyone?). And, yes, there's a vibrating bed to give your Sims the spice they've been missing."", ""While the expansion didn't blow us away, it did provide more of the humor and novelty true <i>Sims</i> die-hards will appreciate.

The game is set between the events of Fallout and Fallout 2. Players control the main character, the leader of a squad of Brotherhood of Steel warriors. Squads consist of a maximum of six characters, including the main character, and are assembled from a pool of 30 recruits. There are vehicles to control, which players can use during combat. The game consists of 20 core missions in six stages. Multiplayer mode is a core design element, and players can enjoy both cooperative and deathmatch games. There are eight multiplayer-specific maps, up to five different play modes, and a maximum of 18 players per game controlling 36 squad members. Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel is set in the award-winning Fallout universe, players join in the Brotherhood of Steel as they travel through 20 tactical missions, attempting to overcome a powerful new enemy. Players will work toward developing their squads' specialized skills and improve their stats as they utilize squad-based skirmish techniques to survive battles. In multiplayer mode, 36 characters can be onscreen at one time with up to 18 gamers playing at once. Bonus mission: Springfield's mayor, a man responsible for many human-ghoul alliances in the region, has been targeted for assassination. His affiliation with the ghouls has angered some far-right human activists who refuse to acknowledge ghouls as near equals.

The focus is on combat, but <i>Fallout Tactics</i> stays true to its RPG roots.', ""You create your own character with the RPG system from the previous Fallout games. The basics should be familiar to RPG fans: assign numbers to attributes, such as strength, perception, and dexterity, which help determine values for skills such as medic, sneak, repair, and big guns. Fun quirks such as fast shot, finesse, and bloody mess make your character unique. Once your character is complete, you're assigned your first mission. There's no need for a strong, personal plot device to get the game going: you're in the army now."", 'Instead of the one-man-against-the-wasteland story of <i>Fallout</i> and <i>Fallout 2</i>, <i>Tactics</i> sets you up as a junior squad leader in an expeditionary force of the Brotherhood of Steel. The Brotherhood is a no-nonsense group of soldiers that has managed to thrive in the nuked American landscape by maintaining strict control over its technological superiority. Your group split off from the main group and headed east in huge dirigibles, only to crash-land near Chicago. Trading technology and protection for food and recruits, the Brotherhood soon finds itself taking on the role of feudal overlord. You and your squad tackle increasingly difficult missions for the Brotherhood. Each successful mission lets you improve your character and squadmates by way of accumulated experience, weapons, equipment, and vehicles.', 'The word ""tactics"" didn\'t get into the title of this game by mistake. Characters can sneak into position, lay down covering fire, set up ambushes, lie prone in a sniper hide, and do just about anything else a real soldier can do. You\'ll need to use these abilities in order to complete the game\'s tough single-player campaign, or against human squad leaders in the included multiplayer mode. You can set the game to play in the strict turn-based mode familiar to <i>Fallout</i> veterans, or can play in ""continuous turn-based,"" which is essentially the real-time strategy mode seen in games such as <i>Baldur\'s Gate</i>. The developers should get a medal for allowing gamers to switch between turn-based and real-time anytime.', ""Between battles, your characters wander the wasteland in search of quests, barter for items, and interact with nonplayer characters whose reactions depend on the squad's reputation. It's enough to keep role-playing aficionados entertained, and action fans won't want to miss it.

SOCOM: Fireteam Bravo 3 lets you join forces with like-minded players on a crucial mission of national security involving realistic military action, tactics and teamwork wherever and whenever you want.', '', '', '<b>Gameplay</b><br /> As with any tactical shooter, <i>Fireteam Bravo 3</i> is all about squad-based combat. In single player action the player is in charge of a four-man Navy SEAL team on a clandestine mission in the fictional Balkanized republic of Koratvia. Being that the Seals are interfering in an internal conflict on foreign soil, plausible deniability on the part of the US government is built into the storyline. This affects the way the game is played in that objectives and support, although clear and present, are not as heavily supported be intel, audio communications with superiors or extensive weaponry provided from the beginning of the game as in other games. Instead, briefings are provided through brief cinematics and most of the game\'s 70+ weapons and items can either be found, taken off enemies or purchased using ""Command Equity"" points, which as in the previous <i>Fireteam Bravo</i> game, are awarded for objective completion. In the end, what this means is that players will be flying by the seat of your pants more than in previous game releases, but also have more perceived freedom of play.', '<i>Fireteam Bravo 3</i> also features a number of new combat features. First, players have more choice in how they command. A full command option, where the precise actions of each member of the team against a common target is available, but they can also defer specific commands to perform coordinated attacks on different targets. The game also features an improved cover system that allows you to target and fire at enemies from behind cover, minimizing the damage that you take. You also have the ability to quick toss grenades, instead of having to focus your trajectory. <i>Finally, Fireteam Bravo 3</i> also features a regenerating health system, allowing players to regain life if they can survive incoming fire and the visual fogginess that engulfs a wounded fireteam member..', '<b>Multiplayer Support and Modes</b><br /> One of the areas where <i>Fireteam Bravo 3</i> shines is in multiplayer. Players will enjoy 2-16 player wireless multiplayer game support, across eight game maps, both via ad hoc and infrastructure connections. Full four-player co-op is also available, with all the combat tactics available in single player campaign. Push-to-talk mic support is available for squad member communication, as well as replacement AI character availability if a player chooses to drop out of a co-op game. Along with Team Deathmatch and Demolition modes from earlier <i>Fireteam Bravo</i> releases, players also have access to new modes: Tug of War, where teams must hold specific positions to gather points; and Leader, in which a team member designated as leader is moved to a specific location while under enemy fire. The player who takes out this leader becomes the new leader, with his/her teammates taking on the role of protectors as the mode starts over.', ""<b>Customization</b><br /> <i>Fireteam Bravo 3</i> allows for maximum customization, both in single player and multiplayer modes. In single player you are able to customize your weapons and those of your squad with a variety of accessories, including scopes, silencers and under barrel attachments. In multiplayer, customization is taken even further with the ability to choose from a variety of special forces, including the KSK, Korean 707, Australian SASR, as well as to create specific tags, uniform colors, etc. Player's friends lists from PlayStation Network can also be imported into the game so you know when and where friends are playing."", '<b>Key Game Features</b>', '']","by

The original SimCity gave players the opportunity to create and oversee the growth of a living city as well as all its problems: crime, pollution, zoning demands, power outages, traffic foul-ups, and the occasional tornado, nuclear meltdown, or wandering monster from the sea. Less a game in the usual sense of the word than a sort of electronic ant farm, SimCity let players see how they fared as mayor, architect and town council. Now SimCity 2000 adds adjustable topography to the fun, using a terrain editor which can create mountains, valleys, ravines, etc. (The new types of terrain also permit the construction of hydroelectric dams and water towers.) Necessitated by this new addition is a new viewing engine, which rotates the player's municipality in 90 degree increments, so that new mountaintop university doesn't block your view of the burgeoning slum down below. As the town progresses through the decades, the sheer size and technological sophistication of your creations become more and more outlandish, and the resultant metropolis ends up looking like something out of Blade Runner. It can take quite a while to become familiar with Maxis' Sim series, and even longer to actually succeed at long-term city goals. Once you get beyond the learning curve, however, the cycle of planning, construction and urban renewal leads to a rewarding creation. And, as always, hard-won cities from earlier versions of the game can be imported for alteration and experimentation. <i>--Chris Hudak/SpotMedia Communications</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Carnivores 2 (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Carnivores 2 by Wizard Works invites you to ""enter the realm of prehistoric reality and take on the quest for survival."" Prepare, in other words, to meet the velociraptor.', ""It's too easy to go on about how terrible most hunting games are. Suffice it to say that such games exist and thrive because they reconstruct a sport whose uniquely violent rules are appealing to a lot of people. These gamers do not specifically want to kill deer; they simply want to experience the hunt. Recognizing this, Russian developer Action Forms created Carnivores, which gave you the hunter's tools of the trade, only you'd hunt dinosaurs instead of deer. Suddenly the ethical argument was no longer relevant - dinosaurs are already dead - and what was left was a great-looking little first-person game that cleverly simulated what it might be like to take on a triceratops with a shotgun. One good idea made way for another, and less than a year later, Carnivores 2 was published. It's essentially identical to the original, but its streamlined gameplay and expanded menagerie make it just as enjoyable. <P>True to its title, this sequel emphasizes dinosaurs of the more voracious variety. Whereas only three dinosaurs in the first game were meat eaters, Carnivores 2 adds the camel-like spinosaurus and the horned ceratosaurus to the fray, which make for a fine assortment of dangerous game alongside the velociraptor, allosaurus, and tyrannosaurus. There are new plant eaters as well, including the armored anklyosaurus. Some of these, such as the towering brachiosaurus, are present to provide atmosphere rather than sport. As in the first Carnivores, everything that lives and breathes in Carnivores 2 looks terrific. All the dinosaurs are carefully detailed and almost disturbingly lifelike as they graze and go about their dinosaur business. They leave trails of blood if you shoot and wound them, and if you take them out with tranquilizers, you can see them heaving in slumber. These are truly some of the best-looking dinosaurs ever rendered onscreen. They also sound convincing, and while you can't know what a dinosaur actually sounds like, Carnivores 2 poses a pretty good hypothesis. The nine species you hunt all have their own distinctive calls, and the larger ones sound downright scary. <P>Fortunately, you've got a pretty scary arsenal with which to take these things down. From the conventional 9mm pistol on up to the long-range sniper rifle, these six guns are all functionally different and tactically interesting. All the weapons from the first game are back, and aside from the pistol, the only other addition is a mean double-barreled shotgun that pays homage to the superweapon of the sequel to Doom, id Software's classic. The hunting tools from the first game are back, including camouflage, cover scent, and even a tracking device that shows dinosaurs on your map. Using these tools detracts from the points you earn with each kill, while using tranquilizers boosts your totals but won't put that tyrannosaurus in your trophy room. <P>You want to earn points because everything you take into the field costs a certain amount. It's like the dinosaur hunter's credit rating; at first you'll only be able to go against piddling plant eaters with a pistol, but soon you'll be able to take on larger dinosaurs with more appropriate weaponry. The first Carnivores forced you to hunt one type of dinosaur at a time with one type of weapon at a time, but Carnivores 2 lifts this restriction and lets you take on as many types of dinos with as many types of weapons as you can afford. This adds a fresh change of pace to gameplay that's otherwise identical to the original, which involves locating, stealthily approaching, and then dispatching the target with a well-aimed shot to its weak spot. As in the first game, dinosaurs respond to you in a fairly realistic fashion and can hear, smell, or see you if you aren't careful. The peaceful ones will then flee, while the carnivores will swoop toward you and turn you into lunch. <P>Or breakfast or dinner if applicable; not only does Carnivores 2 present more and bigger environments than its predecessor, but it lets you choose what time of day you want to hunt: dawn, day, or night. Night missions are seen through the distinctive green tint of vision-enhancement goggles, whereas fog and stark sunlight permeate hunts that take place early in the morning. The effects look great, and the terrain still looks realistic and beautiful. This 3D engine continues to hold up with the best of them. <P>Carnivores 2 is a great diversion just like its ancestor. You can play for a few minutes or, just as easily, a few hours, because each hunt can last for as long as you like, and the game provides an extensive and variable challenge. Your style of play will change drastically depending on whether you're hunting a meat eater or a plant eater, and the game is even more dynamic than the first now that you can throw everything into the mix at once. Those who played the original Carnivores ought to expect more of the same (at the same low price), while those who didn't, but who either like dinosaurs or the idea of shooting them, ought to take this second chance without hesitation. --<i>Greg Kasavin</i><BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

The Balance of Power expansion pack responded to most of the complaints that gamers had concerning X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, but by the time it arrived on retail shelves, most players had already moved on to other games. <P> While the campaigns of the previous games in the series put you in the role of a relatively nondescript fighter pilot and let you participate in some of the key events depicted in the first two Star Wars movies, X-Wing Alliance features a more ambitious campaign. You play as Ace Azzameen, the youngest son in a family of merchant traders who are destined to become embroiled in the growing conflict between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire.

Similarly, instead of inundating you with the same three or four repetitive wingmen taunts, most of the dialogue in X-Wing Alliance is uniquely scripted for each mission.<P> Involuntarily triggering a scripted event too soon can render a mission unwinnable, and occasionally the mission dialogue will progress as if you\'ve completed all of your required chores within an area, although you\'ll subsequently discover (by reading a ""mission failure"" screen, if you\'re not keeping a close eye on the status of your mission objectives in your HUD) that you omitted an important task. <P> X-Wing Alliance uses a modified version of the X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter engine, and core gameplay is substantially similar in both games. Ships are more maneuverable at one-third of their maximum speed, and effectively allocating energy to your craft\'s weapons, shields, or engine in response to new circumstances is vital to successfully completing most missions. The game\'s larger battles can now involve dozens of fighters, and since fighters remain quite fragile, situational awareness is more crucial than ever. <P> The game\'s interface has been modified from the one used by X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, presumably to make more information readily available to you. The horribly cartoonish cockpit artwork used by X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter has been replaced with far less intrusive semitransparent versions, but I suspect that most players will still turn the cockpit off to maximize their view of the gameworld. A padlock view has been added to let you quickly track your target\'s location relative to your craft, but activating the padlock view also annoyingly automatically turns your cockpit art back on, regardless of your previous setting.<P> Using an external view of a ship, you can zoom right in until you can see the pilots in considerable detail. Overall, the graphics are considerably brighter in tone, and less over the top, than those used in Descent: Freespace or Wing Commander Prophecy. 3D sound effects are also supported but are somewhat buggy in the initial release of the game, and LucasArts has indicated that it is working on a patch to fix various 3D sound issues. Competent force-feedback effects are also included, but they are not as well implemented as they are in Descent Freespace or the current version of Independence War. There are a dozen new and generally well-done animated cutscenes littered throughout the campaign, and in keeping with the more character-oriented nature of this installment in the series, these scenes occasionally depict key individuals from the game (and the movies) as opposed to those in Balance of Power, which just showed spaceships. Unfortunately, the tilted but generally unmoving heads used to portray characters are quite unconvincing, and the characters all look like clones of one another. While the introductory cutscene is particularly good, the final ones essentially just reproduce, less effectively, key scenes from the end of Return of the Jedi. The concluding scene is particularly brief and anticlimactic. Between missions you can enter a simulator to replay previous missions or to create your own skirmish engagements using the built-in mission editor. Once your character joins the Rebellion, you can also review a technical library that displays key information on all known craft, or you can prove your prowess on various training courses designed to test your flying and shooting skills. You\'ll earn a series of medals and promotions during the course of the campaign, and in many missions you\'ll also pick up mementos that will be prominently displayed in your quarters, eventually transforming your home into a junkyard of trinkets. <P> For this concluding chapter in its series of space sims based upon the initial Star Wars trilogy, the development team has brought back all the ships featured in other games in the series, including the deadly TIE defenders and missile boats (although the latter fail to make an appearance in the campaign), and also created a large number of new ones for the use of the myriad of smugglers and civilians that appear in the game. X-Wing Alliance lets you play skirmish or proving-ground racing missions multiplayer, but the failure to include a cooperative multiplayer mode for the campaign is inexplicable and a major disappointment, especially considering Balance of Power fully supported multiplayer campaigns. The player-ratings system is still extremely punitive for players who prefer to battle AI opponents, even on the hardest difficulty level, instead of less-predictable, but often less-adept, human adversaries. <P> Unfortunately, while playing many of the missions near the end of the campaign, I couldn\'t help but feel that the game was rushed out to allow LucasArts adequate time to focus attention on its upcoming games based upon Episode I. Promised features, such as the ability for two players to simultaneously fly in a transport, were ultimately excluded. Even though the campaign is completely linear, there are several scripting errors that result in your character prematurely receiving awards or e-mail messages for missions that haven\'t yet been completed. The story-driven campaign ultimately lacks meaningful closure, and even the epic Battle of Endor is somewhat unfulfilling, although the final mission is highly original and well done. In spite of these flaws, most of which are quite minor, X-Wing Alliance\'s huge story-driven campaign, detailed and varied missions, enhanced graphics and sound, capable mission creator, and multiplayer features collectively make it a very good game and a solid conclusion to the series.<i>--Desslock</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Portable gaming entered a new era when the Game Boy Advance was released. This is not your older brother's Game Boy; the Advance has some powerful new enhancements. The screen is bigger, better to see 32-bit graphics. In fact, it delivers a sharper picture than some current TV-based consoles. You'll also see 10 times more colors than the Game Boy Color can display. The Game Boy Advance runs 17 times faster than its predecessor, allowing a range of game features such as scaling, rotating and transparency effects. New left and right buttons give you-and game designers-more options."", ""The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike."", ""Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game."", ""What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles as <I>Super Mario Advance</I>, <I>F-Zero: Maximum Velocity</I>, <I>Army Men Advance</I>, <I>High Heat Major League Baseball 2002</I>, <I>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</I>, and <I>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2</I>--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition of <I>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</I> and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see."", ""When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see."", ""Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen."", ""But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon."", ""Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption.

In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others."", ""For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum."", ""The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (<I>Pikmin</I>, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates."", ""Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started with <I>Donkey Kong</I>. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario, <I>Legend of Zelda</I>, <I>Perfect Dark</I>, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pokmon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, and <I>Star Wars</I>."", ""The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming."", ""In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles.

The only problem is the camera, which is difficult to keep in the right position--you have complete control of it, but it's hard to manage a camera while you're fighting a martial arts expert, a Nazi with a gun, or a poacher keen on decapitating Indy."", ""The graphics are good, pleasantly reminding you of some of the movies' more memorable locales.

As a soldier fighting against the Soviets, you're on the frontline of the conflict and charged with a number of missions, including sabotage, recon, combat, assassination, and fending off enemy attacks. The game is very successful in its approach, but stumbles when it forces you to play vehicle-only missions where you control a tank, an attack helicopter, or an A-10 tank killer."", ""Over the course of the game's 50 single-player missions and campaigns, you'll assume several combat roles, running the gamut from a grunt armed with an M-16 to a tank commander commanding an M1A1 Abrams tank into battle. The bulk of the game consists of you tromping around on foot in first- or third-person mode, and those missions are a great deal of fun. Firefights are intense, chaotic, and often confusing, and they capture what it must feel like to be an infantry soldier caught in a battle. In addition, the included multiplayer mode is a lot of fun, although it can lag at times."", ""Getting used to the controls can take awhile, and will definitely be a hurdle for folks used to the simple keystrokes of most action games. Everything is handled in a realistic manner: standing from the prone position takes a few seconds, the sight on your weapon bounces around as you move, and you can hear your soldier's labored breathing when you sprint across open ground. In fact, you can only sprint for a short distance before tiring (and slowing), which encourages players to make short advances from cover to cover--just like a real soldier. Even the gunfights are realistic: instead of the extreme close-quarters combat and bright crosshairs found in most action games, <i>Operation Flashpoint</i> challenges you to line up a faraway, crouching soldier in the fixed iron sights of a real-world rifle. Successful missions earn a promotion in rank for you and the men under your command; controlling your squad is simple and straightforward and involves just a few keystrokes."", ""On the downside, the difficulty with the complex controls is compounded a million times when you play as a tank commander, where you must issue move and fire orders to the rest of the tank crew. These missions are very frustrating, especially because you can only save once per mission. Because of that, you'll find yourself replaying the tank missions again and again and again."", ""<i>Operation Flashpoint</i> sports a decent graphics engine that is capable of rendering massive and realistic outdoor areas. These large areas really make you feel like you're part of a huge battlefield, complete with forests, scrub, and dozens of vehicles and soldiers. The price you pay is in the form of blocky player models and pixilated plants. In addition, graphical glitches, such as soldiers' heads being on backward, rear up from time to time."", ""Fans of quick-twitch games such as <i>Quake III</i> will probably be turned off by <i>Operation Flashpoint</i>'s realistic gameplay and slower pace. Everyone else will find an exciting, engaging, intense cold war combat game. <i>--Kilmic Robbins</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b>', '']","by

Game Boy Advance - Fuchsia,,['Fuchsia/Transparent Pink color'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Game Boy Advance']",{},"['Product Description\nNintendo Game Boy Advance - handheld game system\n\nFeatures\nDimensions (WxDxH):\t14.4 cm x 2.4 cm x 8.2 cm\nExpansion Slots Total:\t1 game cartridge slot\nProcessor:\t1 x Sharp ARM7TDMI\nWeight:\t140 g', ""The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedules, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike."", ""Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game."", ""What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles as <i>Super Mario Advance</i>, <i>F-Zero: Maximum Velocity</i>, <i>Army Men Advance</i>, <i>High Heat Major League Baseball 2002</i>, <i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</i>, and <i>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2</i>--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition of <i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</i> and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see."", ""When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see."", ""Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen."", ""But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon."", ""Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad. <i>--Porter B.
