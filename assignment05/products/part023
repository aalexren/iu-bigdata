Additional features include, a variety of benefit types for the establishment and adoption of religion, spies that both level with mission completion and that can be a liability if captured, several new playable civilizations, improved battle abilities, and new units, buildings and wonders."", ""The <i>Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings</i> expansion pack* introduces              the power of religion and improved diplomatic abilities to <i>Civilization              V</i>. Religion, used as a major tool, was left out of the 2010 base              game release, but now joins culture, technology, diplomacy, and warfare              as the fifth pillar of the game's turn-based statecraft and empire              building game mechanic. Use of religion begins during a civilization's              infantcy, with the player interweaving select core beliefs with particular              realities of their civilization. This in turn unifies people and generates              faith, setting the stage for the emergence of unit's like The Great              Prophet, Missionaries and The Inquisitor, along with the founding              of a religion.

With spies players can do a wide range of things, including steal technologies, provide intelligence, rig elections, and even counter the actions of foreign spies planted domestically in their own cities."", ""Although religion and diplomacy are potent tools of state craft, war is inevitable.

Despite the debilitated state of the mainland, however, a virtually impenetrable last line of defense stands proud and keeps hope alive for all the land. That beacon of hope is Lazulis Island, ruled by the renowned Count Arganan. With the employment of an army of weapons that magically - and mysteriously- concentrates beasts into a single region, his island has become a small wonder for its powers. Among those coming to the island to seek their fortune is Zael, a young man who at an early age was orphaned when his homeland became one of the many victims of battle. Though he and his band of fellow mercenaries often face disdain and fear as they are perceived to be of a lower class, they manage to catch the eye of none other than Count Arganan himself. If they can successfully complete the tasks put before them by the Count, they may have a rare chance to gain the most honorable status that they have only dreamed of - knighthood. It is during one of these missions bestowed upon them that Zael discovers a hidden site, one which grants him a wondrous and yet familiar power to gather his enemies in one place. The Last Story marks the reunion of two luminaries that helped shape the RPG genre; legendary creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, and internationally-recognized composer Nobuo Uematsu. The genre is advanced with an innovative real-time combat system involving strategic party-based commands that include taking cover from enemy fire, destroying environments to gain a tactical advantage, and drawing fire away from your allies to give them time to cast powerful support spells. Once the battle system is mastered, players can test their skills online where co-op and versus mode for up to 6 players can net special rare items. <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings>

Despite the debilitated state of the mainland, however, a virtually impenetrable last line of defense stands proud and keeps hope alive for all the land. That beacon of hope is Lazulis Island, ruled by the renowned Count Arganan. With the employment of an army of weapons that magically &ndash;and mysteriously-- concentrates beasts into a single region, his island has become a small wonder for its powers.', 'Among those coming to the island to seek their fortune is Zael, a young man who at an early age was orphaned when his homeland became one of the many victims of battle. Though he and his band of fellow mercenaries often face disdain and fear as they are perceived to be of a lower class, they manage to catch the eye of none other than Count Arganan himself. If they can successfully complete the tasks put before them by the Count, they may have a rare chance to gain the most honorable status that they have only dreamed of - knighthood.', 'It is during one of these missions bestowed upon them that Zael discovers a hidden site, one which grants him a wondrous and yet familiar power to gather his enemies in one place&hellip;']","by

With more than 31 million units sold to date, the Metal Gear series has become a global phenomenon. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo stealth missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series\' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.', 'Along with the gameplay, the MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.', 'After the Shadow Moses incident, technological data on the nuclear-armed walking tank Metal Gear leaks onto the black market.

Two years later, the Big Shell, an oil spill cleanup facility constructed on the bay, is taken over by terrorists led by a man claiming to be the long-lost Solid Snake. The government sends Raiden, a new recruit in the new FOXHOUND, to infiltrate the Big Shell and rescue the US President, who is held hostage inside...

The Boss defects to the Soviet Union, taking a miniature nuclear warhead with her as a gift, which her new hosts promptly launch at a Russian research facility. Naked Snake heads once more into the Soviet Union on a mission to kill The Boss...

Like the X3, the X31 combines XBOX live chat with wireless game sound so you can hear the game sound and the voices of other players in the headset. In other words, it replaces your XBOX communicator headset and external speakers. By hearing the XBOX Live chat in the center of your head rather than in one ear, you can communicate better online. By eliminating speakers you can turn up the game without disturbing others. And, by having the game sound right on top of your ears, you can hear even the softest sound cues that are impossible to hear with speakers. For example, you can hear when someone is quietly sneaking up on you and react faster. That means youll have a totally immersive gaming experience while becoming a better player. Just like the X3, the X31 includes a headset and small transmitter. As you can see, the colors have been changed so its easy to see its a new model. What is different, however, is that we made the headset more comfortable by increasing the size of the ear cups so they sit around your ears rather than on top of them. We also replaced the vinyl ear cushions with these soft, fabric mesh cushions that let your ears breathe. The most significant improvement is that the X31 uses digital 2.4 Giga Hertz Radio Frequency wireless technology. This new digital RF technology is a huge improvement over analog IR because it delivers CD-quality sound with no background hiss, no interference from plasma TV screens and no line of sight restrictions between the transmitter and headset. Sound quality is improved with new 40mm speakers that use the same design as our high-quality X41 50mm speakers for better frequency response and improved clarity in the game sound. Inside the headset is a digital signal processor for bass boost and stereo expander effects, which can be turned on by pressing this button. This makes the expander more dramatic than the X3.']",Turtle Beach,"['>#430,448 in Electronics (See Top 100 in Electronics)', '>#60,150 in Video Games > Accessories']",$29.99,Computers,B007OZHAK2

Additional features include: two distinct yet linked playable time periods, advanced weaponry, branching storylines created by player choices in Strike Force missions, exciting multiplayer options, and more.', 'Pushing the boundaries of what fans have come to expect from the record-setting entertainment franchise, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</em> propels players into a near future, 21st Century Cold War, where technology and weapons have converged to create a new generation of warfare between old and new foes. In this conflict, the mechanized creations of men reign supreme, facing off against each other as their creators stay safe and unconflicted, and in the process grow ever softer. In this scenario an important question will be asked: What happens when enemy steals the keys? To understand such a possible future, you must understand where you have been.', ""Players of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</em> gain an understanding of this and more through the game's additional timeline set in the late Cold War era of the 1980's. Within the campaign story, which spans these two eras, players will see familiar faces such as Alex Mason, his son David Mason, and Sgt. Frank Woods. Linking these together will be the rise of another player in the conflict, Raul Menendez."", '<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings> <o:AllowPNG /> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings>

Cut off from the rest of the world, only four individuals who strangely find themselves immune to zombification have the power to protect the remaining survivors from the horrors of the island, to discover what\'s really going on and find a way to escape before their own fatal ends. <table align=right width=480 cellpadding=1> <tr> <td align=""center"">&nbsp;<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI7.jpg"" align=""center"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' game logo"" width=""285"" height=""200""></td> </tr> <tr> <td height=""129""> &nbsp;<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI1.jpg"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' screenshot 1"" border=""0"" align=""top"" width=""230""/> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI2.jpg"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' screenshot 2"" border=""0"" align=""top"" width=""230""/> </td> </tr> <tr> <td height=""129""> &nbsp;<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI3.jpg"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' screenshot 3"" border=""0"" align=""top"" width=""230""/> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI4.jpg"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' screenshot 4"" border=""0"" align=""top"" width=""230""/> </td> </tr> <tr> <td height=""129""> &nbsp;<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI5.jpg"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' screenshot 5"" border=""0"" align=""top"" width=""230""/> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI6.jpg"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' screenshot 6"" border=""0"" align=""top"" width=""230""/> </td> </tr> </table>', '<b>Gameplay Highlights</b>']","by

It also adds additional diplomatic abilities to those found in the base game. Additional features include, a variety of benefit types for the establishment and adoption of religion, spies that both level with mission completion and that can be a liability if captured, several new playable civilizations, improved battle abilities, and new units, buildings and wonders."", ""The <em>Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings</em> expansion pack* introduces the power of religion and improved diplomatic abilities to <em>Civilization V</em>. Religion, used as a major tool, was left out of the 2010 base game release, but now joins culture, technology, diplomacy, and warfare as the fifth pillar of the game's turn-based statecraft and empire building game mechanic. Use of religion begins during a civilization's infantcy, with the player interweaving select core beliefs with particular realities of their civilization. This in turn unifies people and generates faith, setting the stage for the emergence of unit's like The Great Prophet, Missionaries and The Inquisitor, along with the founding of a religion. Religions available initially correlate to actual world religions such as Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Shinto, etc., but they are designed to be renamed and customized with player chosen tenets. Civilizations that found religions enjoy certain exclusive benefits, while a later series of benefits connected to a religion can be enjoyed by any civilization that is converted to it. This includes rival civilizations. As the timeline of the game progresses to the renaissance and beyond, religion becomes less important, but remains a surprisingly powerful tool."", ""The <em>Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings</em> expansion pack also improves on the base game's use of diplomacy, especially in the area of espionage. With spies players can do a wide range of things, including steal technologies, provide intelligence, rig elections, and even counter the actions of foreign spies planted domestically in their own cities."", ""Although religion and diplomacy are potent tools of state craft, war is inevitable. This is why <em>Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings</em> includes expanded abilities to units in battle. Improvements include: expanded general health of units to ensure more time for strategy and changes to forces during exchanges, the inclusion of early multi-winged aircraft, expanded offensive abilities of naval units pitted against other ships and against land tagets, and improved defensive abilities of ground units during transport by sea."", '<em>Gods and Kings</em> also includes additional civilization not included in the initial release of the base game. In many cases, following the theme of the expansion pack these new peoples possess an extreme potential for influence by/and manipulation of religion. A sampling of the new civilizations available include, the Celts lead by Boudicca, the warrior queen of the proto-British Iceni tribe, and the Maya featuring Pacal the Great the long-time ruler of the powerful city-state of Palenque.', '<strong><em>Steam</em> account required for activation and installation.</strong>', ""<strong>Sid Meier's Civilization V</strong> base game required for play.<br /><br />&#xa0;<strong>&#x22;Product only available for US distribution.

Using 20 unique tricks and the ability to steal enemies' powers by swallowing them, players have to make their way through a horrific land filled with all kinds of nightmares.

Each game offers its own story and style of platforming action, as well as unique environments and an assortment of enemies. Swallowing an enemy allows Kirby to copy the abilities of that enemy, granting him the power to perform special attacks and giving him a new hat to don.

Always armed with his trusty ability to swallow enemies and gain special attacks, Kirby can also unite with some of his animal friends and make use of their particular talents. Featuring detailed graphics, challenging boss battles and the distinct charm of a <i>Kirby</i> game, it's no wonder this title is considered a classic.

Dark Matter is after a distant land's powerful crystal, but a young fairy named Ribbon attempts to save it by escaping with the gem to Dream Land. Now the crystal has been broken, and it's scattered around the world. Take control of Kirby and help him journey across six worlds, battling a wide variety of enemies and challenging bosses, as he tries to collect all 100 pieces of the shattered crystal. Along the way, you'll use Kirby's trademark copying ability to use enemies' strengths against them. Not only that, but try combining any two abilities to create a brand-new one that is usually stronger than the original. Throw in three exciting multiplayer mini-games, and you've got a package of which even King Dedede would be proud. Fans of <i>Kirby</i> and action games with bright, colorful graphics should vacuum this one up. (1-4 player, mini-game support)""]","by

Taking to the streets of New York City in search of answers, he quickly encounters a web of lies and vows to rip the truth from those who have hidden it from him and the world. <p/> A few other things that Alex also learns quickly is that he is not alone in possessing amazing abilities, that there is a secret war brewing in New York City and he is on its front lines. A deadly infection has spilled out of control and the government has seized the media to stop the spread of information and has placed New York under quarantine as martial law is instated; igniting a firestorm of combat, carnage and death. As he roams the city, he faces an ever growing army of infected creatures warped and changed by the virus. As it spreads, the virus overwrites the genetics of those it infects, warping and changing their form into something else, something that seems to have been planned. The answers he seeks appear to be tied to the virus, so he rushes to discover the truth behind it, but standing against him and his goal is Project Blackwatch. An elite army specialist force, they are tasked with halting the spread of the virus at any cost and are eager to bring Alex in dead or alive to determine his connection to it. It would seem that they are potentially both enemy and ally to Alex\'s cause. Will Alex assist Blackwatch in its hunt, or join forces with the virus and subjugate humanity, pushing his powers to the limit as the genetic shackles of humanity fall by the wayside? That choice is up to the player in <i>Prototype</i>. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br> In <i>Prototype</i> players engage in \'Deceive or Destroy\' gameplay. This allows gamers the choice to either blend in with the population and covertly progress through the story, or fully unleash Alex&rsquo;s powers, and move through New York City like a walking slaughterhouse, taking control of military vehicles, and causing destruction at every turn. <p/> Although Alex is literally strong enough to fling people and large objects around easily, his most intriguing power is his ability to \'consume\' people. In doing this he acquires their memories, abilities, and their appearance. New memories help him to solve the mystery of how he got the way he is, while new appearances allow him to shape-shift into new useful forms at will and abilities allow him to maneuver in parts of the game requiring specific skills in specific situations. In addition, Alex\'s consumption of people also facilitates his ability to transform his physical body and manipulate his senses. Most weapons acquired in this way are outgrowths from his appendages like exaggerated blades, shields, whips and claws used for brutal close combat, but consumption also allows for powerful abilities like thermal vision, which provides for vision through smoke and obstacles, as well as \'infected vision\' with which Alex can detect hotspots of viral infection throughout the city. <p/> </br><b>Key Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Fast and Deadly Combat</b> - Shape-shift your body to the situation at hand ... from claws to blades to hammers to whips, as you choose the right weapon for the situation. Change to shield or armor for defense or use advanced sensory powers (thermal vision, infected vision) to track your enemies.</li> <li><b>Over-the-top Locomotion</b> - Seamlessly and fluidly bound from building to building, run up walls, bounce off cars and everything in your path. Adaptive parkour lets you move freely through the open-world environments of New York City.</li> <li><b>Unique Disguising Abilities</b> - Consume anyone at anytime, take on their appearance and assume their memories and special abilities.</li> <li><b>Deep Conspiracy Driven Storyline</b> - Wake up with no memory of the past ... just mysterious powers and a link to a town in Idaho. Delve into the mysteries of your origin, the true nature of your power and your part in a conspiracy 40 years in the making.</li> <li><b>Parkour Inspired In-game Movement</b> - Alex Mercer\'s movements are inpired by Parkour, a mostly urban activity bordering on both art and martial arts that aims at moving the human body from one point to another as smoothly, efficiently and quickly as possible. Recent examples of it gained worldwide attention in chase scenes in the 2007 film ""Casino Royale.""</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <table> <tr><td width=""70%""> <h5>System Requirements</h5> <table style=""width: 80%"" border=1 cellpadding=""3"" align=""center""> <tr><td width=""18%"">&nbsp;</td><td width=""70%""><b>Minimum Specifications:</b></td></tr> <tr><td width=""18%"">OS:</td><td width=""70%"">Win 7, Vista and XP</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Processor:</td><td width=""70%"">Intel Core 2 Duo 1.86 GHz/AMD Athlon 64 X2 4000+</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">RAM:</td><td width=""70%"">1GB (XP)/2GB</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Hard Drive:</td><td width=""70%"">10 GB</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Video Card:</td><td width=""70%"">DirectX 9.0c compliant card with 256 MB 3D hardware accelerator</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Additional Info:</td><td width=""70%"">None</td></tr> </td></tr></table></div>']","by

Check VS Mate [Download],,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['This award winning unrivaled 3D, arcade style action Chess game using the most powerful Chess engine in the world: Fritz 11; will provide you with hours of gaming pleasure.', '<div class=""aplus""><table> <tr><td width=""70%""> <P> Check vs. Mate Chess &ndash; the unrivalled champion of strategy games has been attracting players of all ages for countless centuries. Check vs. Mate takes up the mission of adapting the time honoured classic for the 21st century, seeking to breathe new life into the boardgame without abandoning the essential concepts that have made it so timeless. Queen from B4 to E7, checkmate. While normally the game would be finished here with little fanfare, Check vs. Mate takes the moment of victory a step further. The queen suddenly comes to life and gracefully glides across the game board towards the King, a victorious smirk adorning her face. As she approaches the King&rsquo;s square her hands begin to faintly glow, then suddenly plumes of fire spring forth from her outstretched hands and engulf the King, leaving nothing more than a pile of ashes on the square formerly occupied by one of the competing rulers of the checkered kingdom. Now that&rsquo;s checkmate! Battle vs Chess is based on the simple yet ingenious concept of creating a fusion between professional chess software and upbeat, combat oriented game mechanics, complete with richly animated game pieces. At the outset of a match things seem quite basic: a 3D game board pits two opponents against each other in a seemingly ordinary game of chess.', 'The game board itself is set in one of six available environments, each with its own unique landscape and presentation features. Traditionally recognized game pieces have been given a facelift as hulking stone golems and beastly chimaeras take the place of the typical rook and knight pieces respectively. While each game piece is animated with a number of different idle motions as it patiently awaits the coming move, the excitement doesn&rsquo;t begin until its path has been chosen. Once a command has been given, the camera swoops in to a closer viewpoint as the figurine springs to life, moving across the board towards its destination with a style unique to the specific piece. If the target position is empty the figurine will stake its claim and the game continues. If however that square should be occupied by a unit of the opposing forces team then the combatants will engage in a gripping animated clash, resulting in the annihilating defeat of the defending force&rsquo;s piece. Adding yet another layer to the game is the &ldquo;Action Mode&rdquo;, which if activated entirely changes the nature of the game itself! Instead of triggering a pre-scripted combat animation, the act of invading an opposing unit&rsquo;s position will result in gripping battle. As the camera moves to a new 3rd person angle behind the player&rsquo;s unit they suddenly find themselves standing toe to toe with their adversary, and the classic &ldquo;advancing piece takes the square&rdquo; rule is thrown out the window! The ensuing combat is directly controlled by the player, functioning much like a traditional arcade &ldquo;beat &lsquo;em up&rdquo; fighting game. Various weapons, fighting techniques, even combos all play into the action, and to the victor go the spoils. Should the attacking unit win the battle it will triumphantly assume a controlling position in the square as the defeated foe fades from the game board, however if the challenger fails in the attempt to vanquish the enemy than it is forced to limp back to the starting position of its move, broken and defeated.', 'The groundbreaking introduction of vivid 3D conflict animations and optional action integration elements provide a very special breath of fresh air to the classic game of chess. Employing ChessBase&rsquo;s world renowned Fritz 11! chess algorithm software, widely regarded as one of the most sophisticated chess engines in the world, even the most experienced chess experts will be presented with a daunting challenge. All these features paired with an atmospheric soundtrack, special game modes, and a plethora of unlockable bonuses guarantee players long lasting fun with the timeless game of kings! </P>', '<b>FEATURES:</b>']","by

This memory economy gives immense power over society to just a handful of people.Remember Me is a 3rd person action adventure where players take on the role of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into people's minds and steal or even alter their memories. The authorities, fearful of her knowledge and capabilities have arrested Nilin and wiped her memory clean. After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search for her past leads to her being hunted by the very people that created this surveillance society.""]","by

Naturally, mankind had thus always been curious about the seemingly inaccessible Isolated Land, wondering what secrets it may hold. And in an ironic twist of fate, that curiosity and thirst for knowledge and adventure would be fulfilled in a most unwelcome way. With a thunderous sound that shook the entire land, the Thousand Year Mountains came crumbling down, unveiling ancient ruins from the era of the gods. People could finally bear witness to what had been hidden away in the Isolated Land for nearly an eternity - and unfortunately, it turned out to be hundreds and thousands of giants. It became immediately apparent that these were not friendly creatures as they mercilessly turned cities to rubble with mere swings of their gigantic arms, crushing families and histories alike.', 'Now, the kingdom of Rune Midgard is fighting valiantly for the survival of their country against the invading giants. The war has been fierce thus far, with massive casualties, but the resilient humans have managed to keep the giants at bay - if only temporarily. In an effort to prevent any recurrence of this massive tragedy, those in power ordered an enormous fortress called ""The Shield"" built at the entrance to the Isolated Land, to stand as a last barrier of hope and help fend off any inevitable future invasions. The residents of the kingdom may never return to their once peaceful way of life, but they will fight for whatever measure of prosperity they can still find. Their one and only reason to be has been ingrained into every citizen and turned into a rallying cry that echoes throughout the land: ""Fight against the giants, and survive!""', ""<i>Ragnarok Odyssey</i> is an Action RPG set in an original world based on Norse mythology where a battle is being waged between humans and giants after the fall of the gods had previously separated the races.

Always. </b>', '<i>Football Manager</i> is the best-selling, most realistic football management series ever made. Football Manager 2013 celebrates 20 years of games from the people at Sports Interactive by introducing an array of new features.', 'This year&#x2019;s version allows you to take control of any club in more than 50 nations across the world and includes all of Europe&#x2019;s biggest leagues as well as database of over 500,000 real-world players and staff.', 'As well as some landmark new features in the Career Mode, there are now new ways to enjoy your Football Manager experience.', '<b>NEW TO CAREER MODE&#x2026;</b>', '<b>Match Engine</b></br>The 3D match engine has seen huge improvements this year. Everything on the pitch looks more realistic; from the stadiums, the players&#x2019; movement, intelligence, and the way the ball moves through the air.', 'We&#x2019;ve also introduced hundreds of new animations to make the game feel more realistic and we&#x2019;ve made the whole experience more televisual by introducing new camera angles and showing the kick-off and final whistle.', '<b>Manager Roles</b></br>Another notable difference is the significant restructure of the manager&#x2019;s staff and a revamp of their roles. The most obvious is that we&#x2019;ve introduced the position of Director of Football into the game for the first time, which will allow managers to pass on some of their workload, such as contract negotiations, if they choose to.', 'In addition to this, we&#x2019;ve also increased the number of specialist coaching roles within the game and given the manager greater flexibility to choose which coaches offer advice and when. The manager can also choose to complain about boardroom interference &#x2013; although that particular option should probably be used sparingly.', '<b>And much more&#x2026;</b></br>A brand new training system, improved international management, tones in press conferences & a new user interface.', '<b>NEW WAYS TO PLAY&#x2026;</b>', '<b>Classic and Challenge Modes</b></br>Football Manager Classic is a less time-consuming way to enjoy Football Manager. The essence of the game is exactly the same &#x2013; the manager still takes charge of a squad of players and competes at whatever level he or she chooses &#x2013; but they will now find that a number of their responsibilities have either been taken over by their support staff or have disappeared completely.', ""For example, while the player still takes charge of training in FMC, this is carried out at a 'full team' level only &#x2013; there's no individual player training. And when it gets to matches themselves, there are no team talks or opposition reports... you just go straight to a game using the same 3D match engine as Career Mode. The games are played out in a quicker 'highlights only' fashion, but you can even speed this up by going straight to &#x2018;Instant Result&#x2019;."", 'Players who opt for Football Manager Classic will also find that they have a couple of further options in terms of how they play the game; they can either play a full open-ended &#x2018;Career&#x2019; or they can choose to play in the new &#x2018;Challenge&#x2019; mode.', 'In Challenge mode they&#x2019;ll find themselves in a particular situation which will test their management skills over a shorter game time &#x2013; usually half a season. Can you win a trophy with a team consisting almost entirely of kids? Or could you guide your club to safety despite being bottom of the table at Xmas?', 'We first introduced Challenge Mode in Football Manager Handheld 2012 and it proved to be so popular that we&#x2019;ve decided to include it in FMC too.', 'The game will come with four free-to-play challenges, each of which feeds in to a global leaderboard.', '<b>Network Play</b></br>The brand new Network Play is fully integrated with Steam&#x2019;s network functionality which means that players should be able to set up and enjoy games against their friends far more easily than before. The Network Mode also allows people to set-up special one-off leagues and cups and to import their team from their career mode, so you can now end any debate about whose FM team is better.', 'The deeper integration with Steam will also allow us to manage worldwide leaderboards, so, for the first time you&#x2019;ll really know how good a manager you are.', '<b>Plus over 900 other new features!</b>', 'Requires <b>Steam Client</b> to activate.']","by

The Complete Edition also includes every downloadable real world vehicle and city section released since launch. Set in 1912, players assume the role of former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt, sent to the flying city of Columbia on a rescue mission. His target? Elizabeth, imprisoned since childhood. During their daring escape, Booker and Elizabeth form a powerful bond -- one that lets Booker augment his own abilities with her world-altering control over the environment. Together, they fight from high-speed Sky-Lines, in the streets and houses of Columbia, on giant zeppelins, and in the clouds, all while learning to harness an expanding arsenal of weapons and abilities, and immersing players in a story that is not only steeped in profound thrills and surprises, but also invests its characters with what IGN called Emotional ties (that) will continue to set the bar in gaming.']","by
