New features to Deer Hunter 5 include an expanded  virtual season that allows you to manage your deer herd over the years,with  realistic genetics and deer growth. Players are not alone in the virtual woods.  Even when playing single player, computer-controlled bot hunters  roam the woods, attracting and spooking the same deer that you're after. There  are new animals toexpand the challenge, such as elk, grizzly bear, black bear,  and other new animals capable of turning the hunter into the hunted. An improved  3-D engine provides amazing details, such as reflective water, fog coming from  the mouths of the animals incold weather, and light shining off the barrel of  your gun. Thick forests of towering trees will engulf the player in the virtual  forest.<br>  <br>  <br>  <b>Product Highlights</b>"", ""<b>Competitive</b><br>  In competitive mode, hunters competewith each other in timed rounds. The hunter  with the highest scoring deer in each round is the winner. Each sporting arm is  given a value that adjusts the score of the deer up or down, depending on the  difficulty in hunting with that particular gun orbow. If a hunter downs more  than one deer in a round, they may swap deer, but each change reduces the  maximum score of the deer by 10%. So its best to only shoot the deer you want to  keep! At the end of each round, the scores are cleared and eachhunter is able  to take a new trophy without penalty. All trophies taken in competitive mode are  placed in the hunters' trophy room. The time limit setting in the host options  controls the length of the rounds. The kill limit option is not used incompetitive hunts."", '<b>Open Hunt']","by

Dokapon Monster Hunter,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Game Boy Advance', 'Games']",{},"['Following in the footsteps carved by popular franchises like Digimon and Pokmon, Dokapon: Monster Hunter takes players to Dokkano Island, breeding ground for more than 150 monsters. Using a combat system based on rock-paper-scissors, the game offers 120 weapons and 50 shields (each with attack and speed ratings), which can be combined to create an even more powerful arsenal. Players can partner-up with any captured monster and take up to four with them on the adventure, keeping others at the ""ranch"" for future battles. Headquartered in the town of Poponga, the hero has access to Mayor Louie (advice), shopping (buying and selling weapons and shields), healing (church), a caf, and more.\n\nThe island has eight stages with randomized maps for good replay value. While exploring, the hero discovers treasure chests, traps, stairs to different levels, and items such as antidotes, curse removers, Fizzade (recovery from fatigue), warps to home, and more. Traps include poison, curses, nitrous oxide, morphs, blackouts, fatigue, and land mines, all of which have possible remedies. With 29 weapon skills, 11 shield skills, and a half dozen unique tricks (e.g., TakeBack, Double D(efense)) to help build RPG stats in experience, attack, defense, speed, and hit points, gameplay is ever-changing.\n\nTwo players can compete via link cable in Dokapon: Monster Hunter using either Optimistic or Serious Modes. In the former, any property lost during battle to an opponent is returned before the end of the match, while the latter results in forfeiting lost material to the victor. In single-player games, saves occur automatically after losing battles or picking up items, though manual saves can be invoked at any time (except during battle). Up to 16 monsters can be corralled at the ""ranch"" at any given time, in addition to the four in the hero\'s party.']",Nintendo,"['>#24,615 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#212 in Video Games > More Systems > Game Boy Advance > Games']",,Video Games,B000AS3FI6

Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse,,['1 Player'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega CD', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Fans of Mickey Mouse will rejoice over Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse (Mickey Mania for short). The game follows the famous mouse all the way through his glorious career, from start to around 1994.Gameplay wise, Mickey Mania is much like your typical 2D side scrolling action/adventure. You must guide Mickey Mouse through the several different levels and make it to the end of each one. In some of the levels, you just have to make it to the end. In others, there might be a famous Mickey Mouse character, such as the Moose Hunter or the Pauper, waiting for you. Finally, at the end of a few levels, Mickey will have to battle a boss such as a mad scientist, or Pete.In each level, Mickey must collect marbles, which he can throw at enemies. There are also other items that need to be collected, such as yellow stars for energy, and extra lives.Mickey Mania is great when it comes to graphics. Just about all the characters in the game are well drawn and look just like they do in the real cartoons. The levels themselves, and the backgrounds are also well-designed, and some of them are even 3D. For example, in one level, a moose chases Mickey Mouse. What's so great about this one is that Mickey doesn't run to the right or left, like the typical 2D side scroller. Mickey and the moose both run facing you, giving the level a 3D look and feel.If you're a fan of platformers or action/adventure games, Mickey Mania would be a great game to get. Even after years of playing it, it's still a lot of fun to put in and play from start to finish any day of the year. In other words, Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse really is a timeless adventure.""]","by

Star Wars: X-Wing VS TIE Fighter with Balance of Power - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Fly over 50 combat missions in 9 meticulously enhanced Star Wars starfighters with or against your friends. Engage in melees taking on all rivals to determine once and for all who the greatest starfighter pilot in the galaxy is. Single or multi-player - mew missions let you fly for the Empire or the Rebellion, alone or with others, cooperatively or competitively. Includes authentic film score, realistic sound effects and full motin cinematic framing sequences.', 'Very few gamers were entirely satisfied with X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter when it was originally released last summer. In fact, to many gamers, it was both one of the most eagerly anticipated and ultimately one of the most disappointing games of 1997. Critics noted the lack of support for 3D accelerator cards; the omission of several of the more powerful fighters from past games in the series, such as the B-Wing and TIE Defender; the cartoonish cockpit graphics; and the visually disproportionate size of the apparently puny Imperial Star Destroyers. But the most frequently expressed complaint of disgruntled purchasers was that Totally Games and LucasArts, by concentrating almost exclusively on providing a multiplayer dogfighting arena, had abandoned the storyline-driven gameplay of previous games in the series. X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter provided no storyline, no campaigns, no dramatic cutscenes, and overall, a poor single-player experience. Fortunately, Balance of Power does an admirable job of addressing almost all the complaints gamers had with the original game. <P> Balance of Power includes two separate 15-mission campaigns - one for the Imperial forces and one for the Rebel forces. In the Rebel missions you\'ll be on the defensive from the outset, scrambling to regroup your forces in order to fend off, and ultimately destroy, a large Imperial fleet equipped with a gigantic Super Star Destroyer. Ye of little faith who thought LucasArts could never properly depict the size of a massive ship like the Super Star Destroyer will be suitably humbled the first time you lay your eyes on this beast. Although an epic ""attack the Death Star"" mission is still missing, challenging the city-sized Super Star Destroyer provides an apt substitute. The Imperial campaign involves chasing down the Rebels and preventing them from establishing a new Starship Shipyard. Every time you manage to complete five missions in a campaign, you are rewarded with a well-produced cutscene (six in total) that advances the campaign storyline in a compelling manner (and in the largely nameless/faceless X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter universe, which usually means a computer-generated sequence with a lot of ships blowing up). Best of all, the campaigns can be played through by a group of players as cooperative multiplayer missions. After you complete a campaign mission, you can replay it as a training mission. <P> The missions in the campaigns are refreshingly varied in their objectives and design and are, paradoxically, both the best addition to X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter and the cause of the most frustration. A number of the campaign missions are extremely difficult for a single player to successfully complete on the default difficulty level. Since tasks (which are occasionally unintuitive) often have to be carried out in a particular sequence, too many of the missions end up feeling puzzle-like, requiring you to figure out exactly where you have to go at different stages of the mission in order to be successful. Anyone familiar with Lawrence Holland\'s other games, Like X-Wing, Tie Fighter, and Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe won\'t be surprised by the occasionally devilishly challenging mission. But it\'s ironic that the campaigns in Balance of Power were arguably included to provide a better single-player experience, and yet they are extremely difficult for a single player to complete on the default difficulty level. Fortunately there are easier skill levels for frustrated gamers to meekly resort to and even a harder one for gamers who are ""one with the force."" You can also play each mission from the perspective of different flight groups, which enhances replayability by giving you different (often more challenging) mission objectives, and gives you additional opportunities to experiment with the Rebel B-Wing fighter (which is usually not your default choice). <P> For an affordably priced expansion pack, Balance of Power provides outstanding value. In addition to the campaigns and cutscenes, Balance of Power also adds eight new separate ""combat engagements"" (single missions to accomplish specified objectives), one new ""battle"" in which you can link the combat engagements together, and two melees (free-for-all shoot-em-ups). While the only new ship available to you is the Rebel B-Wing fighter, Balance of Power also adds five new capital ships (including the formidable Super Star Destroyer), two new starship bases, and a new gun emplacement platform. Although a 3D patch for X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter was made available some time ago, Balance of Power does automatically add the latest version of the patch and cleans up a few textures. You can now program your own ""taunts"" to gleefully mock your hapless foes. Finally, Balance of Power adds the familiar ""white streaks of light"" hyperspace effect, which was notably absent from the original game. Gamers who have been disappointed by uninspired expansion packs that haphazardly slap together a bunch of single-player missions, throw in a couple of new multiplayer arenas and a handful of units, and call it a day, will be pleasantly surprised with Balance of Power. Balance of Power provides more gameplay than most full games. The only things missing are new sound effects and (Star Wars-fan sacrilege alert!) new music. Don\'t get me wrong - I love John William\'s Star Wars music as much as the next guy, but hasn\'t LucasArts milked the Star Wars theme songs enough? Keep the classic music (what Star Wars game would be complete without the Imperial March), but let\'s have a few new chords next time. <P> Minor complaints aside, Totally Games and LucasArts have finally delivered the game that was so anxiously anticipated prior to X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter\'s release. Balance of Power perhaps arrives a little late, but it is certainly successful in making X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter one of the best games to be released in 1997 - and is still the only multiplayer space sim worth its weight in Jawas. <i>--Desslock</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Use your Bungun to suck up everything in the environment, from hanging baskets and machinery, to earn rewards and create hilarious mayhem', 'The tie-in game to the theatrical film <a href=""/dp/B000CZ0PT4""><I>Wallace and Gromit in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit</I></a> captures Nick Park\'s beloved stop-motion characters, whose clay personas adapt especially well to video games. As in the movie, the latest venture for the inventor Wallace and his faithful dog, Gromit, is the ""humane pest control"" service Anti-Pesto, which is summoned by Lady Tottington to rid her estate of a rabbit overrun. However, Wallace\'s hare-brained scheme for long-term rabbit control has sinister consequences. The video game follows the movie plot and has the additional benefit of using the actors\' voices (Peter Sallis as Wallace and Helena Bonham Carter as Lady Tottington, though Ralph Fiennes does not return as Victor Quartermaine). It\'s great fun to grab the adorable rabbits and eject them with the Bungun, and there are various other gadgets to tinker with. Wallace and Gromit\'s first console video game, <I>Project Zoo</I>, was a Gromit-only single-player affair, but <I>Curse of the Were-Rabbit</I> now lets you play as Wallace (and his alter ego), and there\'s a fun two-player cooperative option (just as long as you don\'t stray too far apart, because the characters are on the same screen). But it also has two major differences that may cause frustration. One is an overabundance of timed challenges, the bane of many gamers (though cooperative play does help). The other is the wide-open nature of the game. The town is fun to wander through and marvelous to look at (and you can clobber anyone you run into!), but many times you\'re left wondering what to do and where to go. But all in all, it\'s a good game for kids, especially those for whom enjoying the journey is more important than getting to the final destination. <I>--David Horiuchi</I>', ""<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>A marvelous world to wander through <li>A sense of fun that evokes the movies, and the original voices of Peter Sallis and Helena Bonham Carter <li>Two-player option <li>A good games for kids, especially those who aren't obsessed with making forward progress. </ul>"", '<b>Cons</b> <ul> <li>Too many timed challenges <li>Open-ended game play can be frustrating </ul>']","by

Your quest: discover the identity of this evil force and rid Phlan of its scourge. POOL OF RADIANCE represents the first in a line of software created by SSI in collaboration with TSR - the producer of the legendary ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS fantasy role-playing system. It adheres faithfully to AD&D game standards. The monsters, items and spells used are from the famous AD&D Monster Manuals, Dungeon Masters Guide and Players Handbook. Roll up your characters from four Classes, six Races and nine Alignments in classic AD&D game fashion; or use the party already provided. The computer graphics are strictly state-of-the-art. Each character comes with a portrait display; every monster type is individually drawn. Cities, dungeons and encounters are shown in realistic 3-D perspective. Swinging swords, flying arrows and fireballs are all part of the Tactical Combat display. Personalize your heroes' combat figures with individual weapons, armor and colors. Add NPCs (computer-controlled Non-Player Characters) to your party of up to 6 PCs (Player Characters) to fill out your 8-character party. Control your PCs during battle, or let the computer handle some or all of the action. To help your party on its many difficult missions, the Adventurer's Journal guides you with history, maps, clues and rumors. A Translation Wheel converts Elvish and Dwarvish writing to English.

Time is of the essence as you try to rotate and/or flip moving pieces to fit as they descend from the top of the screen. Make the pieces fit precisely with the others to form a complete row with no blank spaces. The quicker you position each piece and allow it to drop into place, the better your score. As complete rows are formed they automatically disappear from the screen. When ten rows have been successfully removed, you advance to a higher level and the pieces descend faster.

Following Mia Townsend (played by Josie Maran), the player proves his driving prowess as he is pursued by a veteran police officer named Sergeant Cross (played by Dean McKenzie), who vows to take down the player and end street racing in Rockport.[3] Races seem to be in the player\'s favor until a particular group of racers, led by the game\'s antagonist, Clarence ""Razor"" Callahan (played by Derek Hamilton), sabotages and win the player\'s car in a race.[4][5] Without a car to escape in, the player is arrested by Cross, but is later released due to lack of evidence.[6] Mia picks up the player and then informs the player about Razor\'s new status on the Blacklist, a group of 15 drivers most wanted by the Rockport Police Department. She then helps by assisting the player in acquiring a new car and working his way up the Blacklist. Rivals are defeated one by one, and the player is rewarded with reputation, new rides, and ride improvements with every Blacklist member taken down. As new boroughs are opened up throughout Rockport (Rosewood, Camden Beach, and Downtown Rockport), Mia also sets up safehouses for the player to lie low in, in exchange for placement of ""side bets""

The game takes place in the Phantasy Star time of Space Century 342. Two hundred years earlier, space travel had been discovered, allowing for the colonization of two other planets in the galaxy, Motavia and Dezoris. Now, life was good under the rule of King Lassic and citizens were provided with everything that they could want. Unfortunately, this peace and prosperity did not last. The first change began with a new religion that was rumored to have come from another galaxy. The dark priests of this new religion, though never actually seen by mortal man, supposedly promised immortality to any who would join their cause. King Lassic was getting old and the idea of living forever appealed to him. He became the first to join this new religion. Soon after, he was changed. The change started with a horrific suit of armor that the priests made for him. Soon, outrageous taxes drained the people and trade between the three planets slowed. Eventually all trade stopped. Next, the dead began to rise, striking fear in the hearts of everyone. King Lassic had become an evil tyrant, due to the black magic of this new religion. Where there is evil, there is also good. People began rallying in secret against the evil king. But Lassic&apos;s Robotcops were deadly in hunting down these rebellious defenders.

Drums roll, bugles call, and banners are unfurled above the marching of tens of thousands of troops, wide-eyed recruits alongside battle-scarred veterans, sabers clattering alongside the bags of grapeshot, the wheels of hundreds of caissons rattling, as generals plan and diplomats plot, and as all of Europe reaches with their desperate hands for The Crown Of Glory.\n\nThis year marks the 200th anniversary of great battles such as Trafalgar and Austerlitz, which many consider the start of the Napoleonic Wars and the commencement of one of the most gripping decades in human history. It was an era that saw cobblers become princes and emperors become exiles, an age of legendary diplomats and brilliant tacticians. In Crown of Glory, you control one of the crowned potentates of Europe in the Napoleonic Era, wielding authority over his nation's military strategy, economic development, diplomatic relations, and social organization. \n\nNote: This game is published with a well organized and easy to follow PDF online manual.""]",Matrix Games,[],".a-box-inner{background-color:#fff}#alohaBuyBoxWidget

Using a system of object and motion detection to track your position Toysight allows you to control buttons sliders and perform gestures on the screen putting you right in the action!Variety of Games The games featured in ToySight run the gamut from Sky Diver in which you freefall through the air and try to land as close to a target as possible - to PieSight where the challenge lies in splatting monkeys with custard pies before they can throw bananas at you. You can even grab objects off your desk (Freeverse recommends using real toys) for Toy War in which ToySight creates a digital replica of what it sees in the camera and places it in an arena where it battles another toy supplied by a friend. When your epic toy battle ends keep your friend around for two more multi-player games Submarines and Tennis Xtreme. In the former two subs move back and forth on either side of an island automatically firing missiles every five seconds. You move a slider to change the missile&#39;s angle and try to hit your opponent first one to reach five strikes wins. Tennis Xtreme is played with tanks instead of paddles. The tanks volley a ticking time bomb scoring when it explodes on their opponent.System Requirements:Mac OS X 10.2  G3/G4 400 Mhz  256 MB RAM  200 MB hard drive space  iSight&#153; or Firewire video camera    Format: MAC 10.2 OR LATER Genre:&nbsp;ENTERTAINMENT UPC:&nbsp;080627050145 Manufacturer No:&nbsp;5014'],"by

Napoleon's Russian Campaign,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""In 1812, Napoleon took the greatest risk of his military career. His conquest of continental Europe had resulted in every major power having been defeated by his military might. But one conquest remained, that of Russia and her armies. This campaign, over the vast distances of Russia, would be far different and far longer than any he had attempted before. Will Napoleon prevail and his conquest of continental Europe be complete or will defeat find him on the frozen steppes of the Russian territory? Napoleon's Russian Campaign covers Napoleon's complete campaign in Russia, from the first battles through Borodino and the retreat of the Grand Army. Over 20 maps and over 100 scenarios are included in the game together with a scenario editor and the ability to make an unlimited number of additional scenarios. Also included is a campaign game which allows the player to conduct the complete Russian campaign, making all the significant decisions which will decide the course of the campaign. As Napoleon, the player can choose to be cautious or bold, and possibly change the outcome of history...or be doomed to repeat the mistakes of the French campaign.""]","by

The task at hand is to punch and otherwise kill cyborgs prowling within the halls of the enemy base, which is a maze of connected sectors and floors linked by elevators. The screen is divided into three sections: map, close-up first-person view, and side-view, where the action takes place. Beating each sector boss gives players a key for use in entering the next sector. To help achieve the daunting task of beating this game (there is no password for saving progress), players possess a super-powerful psychic punch and can pick up bombs, shields, a jet pack and other useful items. Despite sluggish jumping and awkward interfacing (two controllers are required), this is an intriguing game with sharp graphics, futuristic music, and a nice marriage of action and strategy.']","by

Players can play on either side and are given a selection of Axis and Allied tanks. Successful players are given command of a platoon of tanks. In Panzer General 2, players fight on the Living Battlefield. Featuring the heightened realism of hand-rendered maps--30 battlefields that are faithful to the real ones of WWII--the Living Battlefield also showcases detailed combat units. Battles rage through World War II's eastern and western fronts, northern Africa, and even the continental United States.

Modern warfare is no match for the fierce realism of six historically accurate seventeenth century pirate raids along the Spanish Main. Aye, Matey! That\'s why plundering and pillaging are back in style, as you command the role of a high seas high-jacker. Either an English Buccaneer, Dutch Adventurer, Spanish Renegade or French Explorer, each with a different skill level and strategic impact. As a swashbuckling scoundrel, you\'ll barter with enemy merchants, trade for hidden treasure maps, negotiate with unscrupulous governors, and forge alliances with monarchs who\'d just as soon stab you in the back than float you a loan for new ships. But that\'s only half the battle! You\'ll also assault towns, sword fight with garrison commanders, lay siege to forts, and fire your cannons broadside at an armada of naval foes, including Spanish War Galleons, Dutch Frigates, French Merchantmen and English Sloops. Arrrrg, Me Swabby! Don\'t think it\'s all fun and destruction. Because if your bloodthirsty crew isn\'t kept happy boarding and burning enemy vessels, or if your navigation skills leave them shipwrecked on a jagged Carribean reef, they won\'t think twice about using you for shark bait. Fortunately if events do take a nasty turn, you can save the statistical loot you\'ve captured and return with a vengeance on another day. So keep your eye (the one that doesn\'t have a patch over it!) on your ultimate objectives - power, fame, prestige, gold, land, and the hand of a beautiful maiden - and you\'ll find the sailing smooth and your ""red beard"" scraggly!']","by

An avid paranormal researcher, Roxy has chosen her new home because she believes it is haunted. Using a host of unreliable detection devices, she plans to use this house as a laboratory. Her goal: proving the existence of psychic phenomena.\nDriving out to the house in a thunderstorm, you are run off the road by a shimmering apparition and are sent crashing into a lake. In short order, you discover other things have gone wrong--Roxy is in the garage, apparently dead. It's up to you to save yourself and the overzealous scientist from the forces lurking in the house.\n\nPatience and close attention to detail are musts for playing Amber: Journeys Beyond. Critical items are sometimes hard to spot, and one or two of the scenes take place in very dark locales. When you can see, the graphics are crisp and drawn with a faint gothic sensibility, surrounding the player in a milieu of creepy sounds and ghost-catching gadgets.\n\nThe game is especially suited to beginning or younger gamers, as the problem-solving challenges are on the simple side.

But only one girl and her horse can go, so you'll have to choose which member of the Saddle Club you want to be. And once on the island you'll have to solve a baffling mystery to save Willowbrook Stables from the evil property developer trying to take over. \n\nThe island is a complex and colorful world of sights and sounds. It is home to over 30 characters, most of whom have lived there all their lives. Even though the other Saddle Club members won't be with you, you can still keep in touch and tell them all about Willowbrook Stables and your adventures. \n\n\nOther horse-crazy kids on the island will help you in your quest to save the stables. The skills that Lisa, Carole, and Stevie learned at Pine Hollow will come in handy in your investigations, as horses are just as important on Coventry Island as they are in Willow Creek. Ride all over in search of golden horseshoe clues and collect important information from interesting characters. You can get additional clues and track your progress in your personal game diary. \n\n\nIf you solve all the clues, you'll uncover secrets that have remained hidden on Coventry Island for decades. You will have to be careful, though, as others are trying to solve the mystery, too--people who will stop at nothing to do so.
