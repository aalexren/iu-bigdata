You even get to control a submarine's torpedoes and anti-aircraft guns during one mission. The graphics for the weapon models and environments are first class, with excellent detail and sharp textures. One of your paranormal Ubersoldier powers is the ability to put up a bullet shield, which can stop bullets in their tracks <i>Matrix</i>-style.

Firefights are fast, frequent, and bloody, and the weapons feel as they have real force to them. The enemies in <i>Ubersoldier</i> are not exceedingly bright, but they're often cunning and extremely reactive. They will open up their machine guns the moment they see you and will heave grenades that will force you to clear out quickly -- that is, if you're not blown up first!"", ""In <i>Ubersoldier</i>, the ESRB-mature rating is for good reason. When you shoot a guy, the nearby walls and floor run red with blood, and if you hit him in the face a few times, you're screen will soon fill up with a reddened, leaking pulp. If an enemy has the misfortunate to end up in close proximity to a grenade blast, he will grab his head and stumble about, wailing in agony until you put him out of his misery. In fact, putting a few enemies temporarily out of service with a grenade, only to finish them off while they scream and suffer, is a macabre but effective technique. You will get to see some cool scripted events too, such as an enemy falling off a rooftop after getting shot, only to hit a power line in an explosion of sparks on the way down. The designers thoughtfully scattered just enough explosive fuel barrels and oxygen tanks around the levels to add to the mayhem, creating loads of smoke and fire, flying bodies and debris."", 'Indoors, the game takes you from dank sewers to a plush auditorium, from a disgustingly urine-soaked bathroom to human experimentation laboratories, and everything in between.

The backgrounds are all animated, with air-duct fans that rotate, large pieces of machinery that chug and whirr, and control panels that blink and flash. Not for those who are squeamish or too easily startled, <i>Ubersoldier</i> boasts smooth battles that have plenty of visceral carnage, well-paced missions, and an overall strong sense of forward momentum that keeps you active without ever feeling harried. <br clear=""all"">']","by

As a private in the Russian army, you will fight off waves of invading German troops and Panzer tanks in Moscow and Stalingrad. Once you finish the Russian campaign, you\'ll go up against Field Marshal Rommel\'s troops in the deserts of North Africa. As part of this campaign, you\'ll race around in your own tank with others at your side, and later you\'ll be tasked with calling in air strikes against enemy tanks. The final campaign has you in the role of an American corporal in Europe, but unlike most WWII games, you won\'t perform a D-Day landing on Omaha or Utah Beach. In <i>Call of Duty 2</i>, you have to scale the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc with the Army Rangers amidst a hail of artillery and machine gun fire, giving you a true appreciation of the time-honored saying, ""War is Hell!""', ""<i>Call of Duty 2</i> is a thinking-gamer's first-person shooter of medium difficulty. While there are many reflexive elements, the game quite often requires you to consider the tactics of the situation in order to survive. While you can probably blow through the game in 10 hours on the regular setting, the more difficult settings require you to be much more thoughtful about your approach to the different scenarios. Your teammates in battle neither finish your fight, nor simply provide enemy fodder, while the enemy AI (artificial intelligence) is quite clever. If you are too meek, you will find yourself pinned down by aggressive fire while the enemy lobs grenades at you until you're decimated."", ""Unlike the its predecessor, <i>Call of Duty 2</i> doesn't give you a health bar. Instead, as you are hit by more and more fire, your screen grows increasingly red around the border, and your character begins to grunt and pant. This is your signal that it's time to find some cover in order to recuperate before you continue. Another major improvement is the enhanced smoke grenades, which not only look great but can be used effectively in battle to obscure your path from tanks or machine-gun nests as you make your way to an objective."", 'While <i>Call of Duty 2</i> has received an ESRB T (teen) rating -- meaning there are no gratuitous blood and guts splashing all over the screen -- this is still war, and there are enemies that will try to drag themselves to safety after being hit, only to be bludgeoned to a screaming death by your fellow men-at-arms. And like its older brother, <i>Call of Duty 2</i> offers the standard deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and search-and-destroy multiplayer modes. However, this version offers a new option called ""headquarters,"" which most closely resembles the ""crazy king"" version of king-of-the-hill in Halo 2. Shifting headquarter points appear and must be captured in order to start building points, only to be overrun by the other side in order to halt that point gain. This version of the multiplayer mode is not only extremely fun, but it requires teams to adapt on the fly.', ""Unlike the original, in this sequel you can skip forward from one mission to the next once you've cleared a campaign. The game also auto-detects 16:9 and 16:10 wide-screen ratios, as well as the sometimes tricky 5:4 ratio for LCD monitors. As the user, you can make use of a good set of performance tweaking functions, or you can allow the game to determine the optimal ratio, based on your system. With the addition of actual war footage as introductions to each campaign, and famous war quotes at the end of the scenes, <i>Call of Duty 2</i> has everything you need to lose yourself in the middle of the biggest war in history of the world.""]","by

The mouse allows you to do pretty much everything, from laying out cities to picking up and dropping citizens around the map. The <i>Battle of the Gods</i> expansion includes a handful of new buildings that add a few more tactical options, such as a blacksmith that can upgrade your soldiers and hospitals, letting you save the manna you would normally spend on healing for use on other miracles. The mouse also allows you to punish or reward your creature for its behavior at the click of a button, so you can quickly train it to do what you want, from fertilizing fields with its manure to knocking down enemy walls.', 'It\'s possible in <i>Black &amp; White 2: Battle of the Gods</i> to simply assimilate your enemies\' followers peacefully by building a city of such grandeur that they want to defect. However, the sheer size of some of these maps can make this a long and drawn-out process, since you would require such a huge and impressive city. And besides, who really wants to be a completely peaceful and benevolent god? Instead you send your creature into the fray to defeat the enemy god\'s undead creature and crush the Aztec armies, thereby letting loose the platoons you have been building in order to seize and capture defenseless Aztec towns. <P> One other change is the addition of more mini-game challenges that you can pursue for additional tribute points, and which let you unlock new buildings and powers. These challenges provide short diversions from the main focus of the game, as you solve puzzles, participate in ice curling, target practice on zombies with lightning bolts, and more. Whether you pursue a peaceful or militaristic approach, you\'ll find that it\'ll take you hours of enjoyable gameplay to get through each map, and, especially for those of you who already loved the unique world and gameplay of <i>Black &amp; White 2</i>, that is all that need be said. <br clear=""all"">']","by

When asked if the story will come to this sort of an end, Kojima responded without the slightest bit of vagueness, ""It will come to an end."" The <i>MGS4</i> E3 trailer showed a number of characters from the <i>Metal Gear</i> and <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> histories. This final installment is sure to deliver loads of cameos, in fact, it is rumored that nearly all the characters from the series will make an appearance.', 'In addition to a return of classic <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> characters, the gameplay systems from part three are also expected to make a comeback. The camouflage system from part three will make it into <i>MGS4</i>, with the addition of ""OctoCamo,"" Snake\'s most advanced stealth suit to date. The name appears to be formed from the words ""Octopus"" and ""camoflauge,"" and players will be awestruck by the chameleon-like camo that changes with the surroundings. OctoCamo allows Snake to blend in with his environment as it digitally manifests nearby textures in real time. Think if it this way, if Snake is standing next to a wall worn out with holes, he too will appear to be riddled with holes. It has also been revealed that <i>MGS4</i> will have online play, but no specifics have been released.

Besides his trusty sword and shield, Link will use his bow and arrows by aiming with the Wii Remote controller, fight while on horseback and use a wealth of other items, both new and old.', ""<b>Link's journeys, reinvented</b><br /> Hailed by many as the best Zelda game since 1998's <i>Ocarina of Time</i>, <i>Twilight Princess</i> thrusts players into a troubled world ravaged by a dangerous magic. Sporting a new, more realistic visual style than the previous Zelda title, Link looks much more like an adult than in previous installments and fits well into an environment that provides Zelda fans with a much more gritty and grim environment to explore. The entirety of the quest fits this darker mood, as both Link and NPC's alike share the same concern for the changes about in Hyrule."", 'More than just a spiritual successor to previous Zelda installments, <i>Twilight Princess</i> offers players a new way of controlling Link through dungeons, forests, towns, and the bizarre Twilight Realm: precise weapon controls with the Wii remote! Players can use the remote to control Links\' weapons including the sword, arrows, and boomerang. This new control scheme allows for much faster and more accurate control than on previous Nintendo hardware. For example, waving the remote in the air will result in Link performing the same move with the sword. To fire off on arrow, players ""pull back"" on a virtual controller string as the Wii remote\'s speaker lets players know that the projectile is ready for release. It all works incredibly well and adds to the title\'s immersion and style- you feel more in the center of the action than in previous Zelda games.', 'As impressive as the new control scheme is, the scope and size of the new land of the Hyrule is equally as impressive- truly the Wii\'s first epic adventure. Beautifully crafted and four years in the making, the land players travel through is vast and diverse as the dungeons and monsters that lie within. As players collect triforce pieces from the distant sections of the continent, they will get to know many different villages and foes. Thankfully, Link will be able to move over long stretches of land faster thanks to ""Epona,"" your faithful horse. Epona also helps Link become a more effective fighter, as a number of powerful and impressive sword strikes can be launched while galloping through fields of enemies.', '<b>The Twilight Realm awaits</b><br /> Like most games in the Zelda franchise, Link begins his adventure with little more than the clothes he has on an an inkling that something has gone awry. After an initial trip to the Twilight Realm, in which Link appears as a wolf, a friendly shadow dweller named Midna will meet up with players and give helpful advice on gameplay. Fortunately for players, this virtual assistant spells out ways to be a more effective adventurer in and out of the shadow world. Early stages of the game have Link spending a lot of time in the Twilight Realm, and outdoor areas of Hyrule, attempting to clear areas of the strange darkness that has seemingly fallen over every village, forest, and field. As the story progresses, players will learn the cause of the shadows, and what they must to do vanquish them for good.', ""<b>Puzzling puzzles</b><br /> Link once again finds himself in a number of classic Zelda-esque puzzle scenarios in which he must light torches to unlock doors, raise and lower water levels, and fight enemies to collect keys and open chests for valuable rupees. A number of the dungeons present unique puzzle challenges that rely on the player's ability to hone their Wii remote's control, such as an air castle in the sky that can only be accessed by an extremely accurate grappling hook toss."", ""In general, <i>Twilight Princess</i> is more challenging than the average Zelda game, with a number of boss battles having protracted hit sequences with little support potions about, and even less warning. Still, there's never been an adventure experience such as this, wherein players can literally charge at a dungeon boss with their fists and punch the air to defeat an enormous foe.

They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself."", '', 'Vice City, 1984. Opportunity abounds in a city emerging from the swamps, its growth fueled by the violent power struggle in a lucrative drugs trade. Construction is everywhere as a shining metropolis rises from foundations of crime and betrayal. As a soldier, Vic Vance has always protected his dysfunctional family, his country, himself. One bad decision later and that job is about to get much harder. Kicked out onto the streets of a city torn between glamour and gluttony, Vic is faced with a stark choice - build an empire or be crushed.', ""<b>Impressive graphic overhaul</b><br /> Vice City Stories is a monumental improvement upon the previous Grand Theft Auto title on the PlayStation Portable. For one, the draw distance has nearly doubled so that buildings and features can be seen across town. Character models and cars are as detailed as if they were on the PlayStation 2 and include all of the shine and transparency that looked so great in other Grand Theft Auto titles. Players can even choose the clothing that Vic will wear in Vice City. Overall, Rockstar has substantially increased all visual elements so that you don't need to make any graphical sacrifices when taking Grand Theft Auto on the road."", ""Even the city appears as never before- people on the street will notice you and recognize you for the actions you've taken on previous missions. Some even comment about actions you've taken and give you an idea about how the public feels about your notoriety."", '<b>Expanded gameplay</b><br /> New characters never before seen in Vice City add new twists to the story gamers were introduced to in the PlayStation 2 Vice City title. With a playtime of over 15 hours for the storyline alone, there is certainly plenty to see and hear in and around the city. Choose from various objectives to complete such as doing stunts for a chocolate commercial, chasing a known drug dealer to swipe his loot, and patrolling your neighborhood for specific thugs. Knock down objectives and get swept up in the plot or sit back and explore the big city- the choice is yours!', 'The hallmark style of ""sandbox"" gameplay is ever present and players can (forcefully) take control of nearly any vehicle they see and roam the streets in search of interesting characters and opportunities. In addition to cars, busses, bikes, and trucks, you can now cruise the waterways of Vice City in a large number of water craft! Jet-skis, motorboats, and even fishing vessels are there for the taking whether you\'re tracking the bad guy or just killing time. If you need even more mobility, consider one of the many arial options such as helicopters- helpful for taking out enemies from afar.', '']","by

In <i>Full Auto 2: Battlelines</i>, the once-pleasant districts of Meridian City are turning into battle zones, rife with automotive destruction. Use explosive weapons, high-speed vehicles and skillful technologically-groundbreaking demolition of the environment to defeat your opponents and claim the city as your own.', ""<b>Start it up and never look back</b><br> <i>Full Auto 2</i> takes you right into the action and doesn't bother itself with a fluffy story line or lengthy cinematics- this game is all about hardcore cars and even more hardcore weaponry. Thankfully, the vehicles handle well and it's easy to quickly feel comfortable directing your ride while firing rockets and other munitions. And speaking of weapons, all the classics are back and improved, such as the front-mounted machine guns, shotguns, Titan Missles, and mini rockets. Rear-mounted weapons such as the smoke screen, mine layer, and flamethrower are also available for selection."", ""The appeal of <i>Full Auto 2</i> is not difficult to explain: cars and explosions go together like a wink and a smile. The game's developers know the sweet feeling that can only come from mounting a full frontal assault from the drivers seat of an armored SUV. While the scenarios in the game are sometimes over the top, they are always fulfilling and exciting. If SUVs aren't your cup of tea, there are also classic muscle cars, low riders, monster trucks, and industrial vehicles to drive, enjoy, and destroy."", '<b>A trip around the ""Razetrack""</b><br> All four racing districts from Full Auto have returned, but most are barely recognizable. The Outskirts District, for example, barely resembles its previous form- bigger landmarks, smoother drive paths, and new traffic vehicles make the experience of racing in the city one second and a canyon the next even more exhilarating. Each district also has new shortcuts and alternate paths, so even if you had mastered a route before, be prepared for an entirely new environmental challenge.', ""As if the existing districts weren't already plenty, <i>Full Auto 2</i> adds two additional districts to the mix. The impressive Financial District is a maze of glass and iron, just waiting for some heavy artillery to rip it apart. Taking out major glass structures opens up new paths for racing and shortcut options. Just don't miss the exit window, or you'll be the one that's looking for cover."", 'The new Industrial District is like a jungle of massive machinery. This district, more than any other, seems to be created for the sheer fun of blowing everything in sight sky high. Nearly everything you see or race around can become a target. Huge explosions will engulf your enemies as you speed to the next weapon upgrade- driving on the wrong side of the tracks was never this much fun!', 'The scale of destruction that you can unleash upon your enemies and the environment is truly unique, and simply cannot be matched by other racing titles. Explosions can even trigger additional, larger explosions, creating a literal chain of destruction. Take out an oil barrel and watch it ignite some unsuspecting traffic. If the burning traffic makes a wrong turn, it can bring an entire building down!', ""<b>Unlimited firepower with friends</b><br> Multiplayer modes are the centerpiece of any quality racing title and in this regard, <i>Full Auto 2</i> doesn't disappoint. Gladiator and Team Gladiator feature deathmatch rules with a challenging twist: how can you possibly cooperate with teammates with all that tempting firepower on the road? Fortunately, it's extremely fun to gang up on the other team, especially if you can ram them from both sides or force them into a building or off the road."", 'Base Assault is a new multiplayer mode that plays as a sort of ""capture the flag"" on very destructive wheels. Teams must find a bomb power-up and carry it to their enemies\' base to cause massive damage and score points. The first team to destroy their opponents\' base wins. Because of the strategy required, this mode is online-only, and works great as an excuse to take your PlayStation 3 online. <i>Full Auto 2</i> is so much more than simple ""drive and gun,"" and the huge variety in the vehicles and environments permits for hours and hours of rocket launching fun.']","by

The legendary sword was once used to punish dishonorable Godfathers, and has since become a symbol of peace.

This new Rayman game features the funniest, zaniest, wackiest antics ever when hordes of nasty bunnies invade Rayman's world. They enslave him, forcing Rayman to participate in a series of gladiator-like trials. In order to win his freedom, Rayman must entertain and outwit these crazed, out-of-control bunnies."", ""<b>Welcome to a new generation of Rayman</b><br /> You'd be hard-pressed to find a game with as much character as <i>Rayman Raving Rabbids</i>. From the creative minigames to the quirks of the bunnies, this game packs an immense amount of entertainment on one disc. It's rare in games that failing during a competition can bring you as much joy as actually succeeding, but <i>Rayman Raving Rabbids</i> does an admirable job of rewarding your failure with a large dose of comic screams, flying plungers and crossed eyes."", 'Of course, the point is to succeed and not let the bunnies laugh at your failure. <i>Rayman Raving Rabbids</i> may have a lot of style but it has very little plot. Each level consists of four minigame challenges and one ""boss battle,"" so to speak. If you complete at least three of the minigames, the main gate opens, allowing you to take on a greater challenge. Once you play a minigame in the Story Mode, you unlock that minigame and can play it at any time and against friends.', ""<b>Exercise your Wii Remote</b><br /> Hand it to Ubisoft's development crew as they really took advantage of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers' capabilities. Some minigames are as simple as twirling the Wii Remote like a lasso and pushing a button to launch a cow as if you were in a hammer throw competition. Some minigames really test your coordinating, asking you to swing the Nunchuk like a jump rope and flicking the Wii Remote up to make Rayman jump."", ""Each level has one consistant challege, however: a rhythm game. As a song plays, the bunnies approach a spot on either stage left or right. When they hit that spot, you'll shake the Nunchuk (if the bunny is on the left) or the Wii Remote when the rabbid hits the mark."", ""When you take on the boss stages, you'll find yourself, more often than not, playing a rail shooter. The Wii Remote becomes your light gun, firing plungers at the horde of oncoming rodents. When your plunger supply runs out, shake the Nunchuk to reload. In recent years, the rail shooter (where you don't control the movement) has been forsaken for the first-person shooter and free movement. The Rayman boss experience will make rail shooter fans rejoice. If other shooters can perform as well as the plunger-fueled firing action of <i>Rayman Raving Rabbids</i>, the genre will come back with a vengeance."", ""<b>Impressive replay value</b><br /> There's extra incentive to play the many minigames of <i>Rayman Raving Rabbids</i>. When you complete a game in Challenge Mode, the game gives you a code that you can enter at the Rayman Web site which basically gives you access to special features on the site."", ""The minigames of <i>Rayman Raving Rabbids</i> skew toward a younger audience, and at first, an above-average gamer should find the games to be pretty easy. However, once the minigames are unlocked, a big challenge awaits you to get the highest scores and blast your friends in multiplayer challenges. That's when the real party begins! Rayman delivers exactly what the Wii promises: fun and lots of it. Here's hoping the bunnies come back for multiple invasions!"", '']","by

Now Jonathan and Charlotte must work together to confront the two vampire sisters, and ensure that this villainous catastrophe is not unleashed on the world.', ""<b>Gameplay</b><br> Evolving the action-adventure gameplay that has been the series' trademark for 20 years, <i>Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</i> lets players switch freely between Jonathan and Charlotte as they proceed on their heroic mission, each with their own strengths, abilities and style of play. Players can now utilize powerful combination attacks in which both characters unleash the full extent of their combat abilities to decimate the game's more than 100 different enemies and bosses. In their quest to stop Dracula's resurrection, Jonathan and Charlotte can collect and use different weapons, equipment, and items to increase their overall skill level and acquire new abilities."", 'As mentioned before, players can switch freely between both characters, a necessary option to win the game. For instance, you need to analyze certain situations and carefully choose to play either Jonathan or Charlotte in order to successfully battle against the vampire army. The two characters can also combine their powers to pull-off powerful combo attacks. Their combined abilities are needed in certain parts of the castle in order to progress through the game.', ""The game has two different endings. Both endings involve the prevention of Dracula's resurrection, however only one actually involves the defeat of Brauner. Different choices allow for a uniquely diverse gameplay experience."", '<i>Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</i> supports the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection with a limited cooperative play mode feature. There is an online shop mode used through Wi-Fi as well. Players are able to put their items up for sale in a realistic marketplace. And perhaps best of all, when another player buys the item, the selling player gains the money but doesn\'t lose the item. <br clear=""all"">']","by

Other characters were more reminiscent of Roman gladiators such as ""Maximus"", the houngan ""Voodoo"", the questionable Kabuki Jo and the obviously fictional cybernetic ""CY-5"".\n\n\nPlot\nMany, many years ago, a spaceship carrying precious life-giving ore crashes to Earth.

Now, what about a high-performance sound system to enhance your gaming experience? Designed to match the style of the Xbox 360, Pioneer\'s HTS-GS1 5.1-Channel Surround Sound System may be just what you\'re looking for. After setting up this home-theater-in-a-box (HTIB) system, we sat back and enjoyed several hours of pure gaming bliss. Whether we were battling online against other <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008J7NZ/${0}"">Halo 2</a> gamers, or saving the planet in the Xbox 360 title, <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000C427NM/${0}"">Prey</a>, this system delivered awesome and inspired surround sound.', ""<b>Easy Set-up and Configuration</b><br> Everything you need to set up the HTS-GS1 is included in the box. Using the handy Quick Start Guide, we had the entire system wired in less than an hour. The easy-to-follow instructions and color-coded wires made the set up of the center speaker, subwoofer, and two rear and two front speakers a cinch. One word of warning: the included wires are an adequate length for a small-to-medium sized room, but if you really want to spread out, you'll need additional wiring to complete the task. But for our purposes, the HTS-GS1 provided everything we needed to get the job done."", '<table cellpadding=""4"" border=""0"" align=""left"" width=""175"" cellspacing=""3""> <tr> <td><hr noshade=""noshade"" size=""1""> <font face=""Arial,Helvetica"" color=""336600""> <B>The HTS-GS1 is an ideal choice for any small-to-medium sized space that is dedicated to Xbox 360 gaming.</B> <br> </font> <hr noshade=""noshade"" size=""1""></td> </tr> </table>', '', 'Once the speakers were in place, we took advantage of the system\'s auto MCACC microphone calibration technology. We simply placed the ultra high-end calibration microphone on the back of the couch -- directly behind our favorite gaming position -- and the HTS-GS1 automatically adjusted the sound for the distance, volume, speaker size, and equalization. Once the system calibrated the speakers to match the layout of our room, we were off to the races --literally -- tackling the toughest race tracks available on <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000B6ML28/${0}"">Project Gotham Racing 3</a>.', 'Although all the connections were easy to distinguish and connect, we do have one complaint: there are loads and loads of wires to deal with. This is not a problem unique to the HTS-GS1, but we found it a bit ironic that a home-theater-in-a-box designed to complement the Xbox 360 -- a gaming system noted for its clean design and wireless capabilities -- would be so overloaded with wires.', ""<b>Sleek, Xbox 360 Design</b><br> This surround sound system offers an attractive white design, accented with gray speaker grilles, and features five small satellite speakers (center, two front, and two rear), and a large subwoofer that is about the size of a standard CPU tower. Although the subwoofer is a bit bulky, it houses all of the system's electronics and connectivity jacks. And since this theater system lacks a DVD player (the assumption is you'll use your Xbox 360 for movies), the display unit is quite small; in fact, it's not much bigger than the included remote control. It features tiny, silver control buttons and a large, circular power button. The front panel delivered all the information we needed via a scrolling single-line display. The included easy-to-use remote control is packed with features, and, like the rest of the system, it also matches the Xbox 360 design. With it we could control all of the system's features, as well as our Xbox 360 gaming console."", '<b>Sound Designed for High-Performance Gaming</b><br> With the HTS-GS1 we could hear every audio effect the Xbox 360 had to offer -- from the lightest wind to bone-rattling explosions. The system delivers great audio performance with a powerful 600 watts of total RMS power, and dynamic 5.1-channel surround sound with Dolby Digital/Pro Logic II and DTS decoding. In addition to playing video games, the Xbox 360 also plays DVDs and MP3 files. We took advantage of both and spent an afternoon watching movies, and an evening listening to a stack of CDs. The system responded to every form of entertainment that we could throw at it -- games, film, and music -- with crisp, clear, and powerful sound.', 'The HTS-GS1 also features Front Stage Surround Sound, a virtual surround-sound feature. To test this function, we moved all the speakers to the front of the room. Through its sophisticated digital sound processing and directional speakers, the system can mimic surround sound without the hassle of running wires to additional rear speakers. Although the traditional surround sound set-up delivered the best audio surround sound quality, the Front Stage option was still much better than our regular, old television speakers.', ""The HTS-GS1 can be a bit pricey when compared to other home-theater-in-a-box systems, but Pioneer's design may trump the cost for those who want an attractive, surround-sound option that matches the Xbox 360's style. And even though his system may not be the optimal home-theater system choice for a large family room, the HTS-GS1 is an ideal choice for any small-to-medium sized space that is dedicated to Xbox 360 gaming."", ""<b>Pros</b><br> <ul> <li>Attractive, Xbox 360 design <li>Simple set-up and great sound <li>Ideal for any small-to-medium sized gaming room </ul> <b>Cons</b><br> <ul> <li>Lots and lots of wires <li>A bit pricey when compared to similar HTIBs </ul> <b>What's in the Box</b><br> Receiver/subwoofer, five satellite speakers (two front, two rear, and one center), display unit, remote control, two AA batteries, two display unit stands, AM loop antenna, FM wire antenna, display unit cable, optical cable, power cord, five speaker cables, microphone (for Auto MCACC setup), non skid pads (small and large), mounting brackets, screws, operating instructions, and warranty card.""]",Pioneer,"['>#604,027 in Electronics (See Top 100 in Electronics)', '>#1,127 in Video Games > More Systems > Xbox > Games']",,Home Audio & Theater,B000H683YC

Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.', 'Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.', ""Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use.

Nintendo fused the global familiarity of a remote control with the sophistication of motion-sensing technology to come up with an input device that differentiates the Wii from any other console that has come before it.', ""<b>Revolutionary control</b><br> Sporting the dimensions of a small traditional remote control, the wireless Wii Remote is a multifunctional device that is limited only by the game designer's imagination. The magic of the Wii Remote's design lies within; acellerometers inside the controller body measure movement in all directions and at all speeds. In a tennis game, it serves as your racket as you swing your arm for a long forehand or a quick and hard backhand. In a 4x4 driving game it serves as a steering wheel, allowing you to swerve to avoid obstacles or pickup power-ups. In first-person shooters, the Wii Remote acts as a firearm that you can point directly at an on-screen enemy. The list of potential uses is enormous, and the light weight of the Wii Remote allows gamers to play for hours without feeling fatigued."", '<b>As comfortable as it is functional</b><br>', 'The Wii Remote is equally comfortable in right and left hands and houses just the right number of buttons for gaming- not so many that new players will get confused, but enough so that Wii games don\'t feel constrained. On the face of the remote are the D (or ""plus"") pad, a large ""A"" button which is used for major on-screen actions, and two small options buttons. Between the game buttons are a plus and minus buttons (which often act as ""forwards"" and ""back""), as well as a ""Home"" button to engage the Wii home screen to change settings or check remote battery levels. On the back side of the controller is a trigger-like ""B"" button, perfect for timing releases of a bowling roll in <i>Wii Sports</i>.', 'Thankfully, battery life is excellent with the two included AA batteries, just as with the previous generation of Nintendo wireless controllers.', '<b>Immersive intelligence</b><br>', 'Along the bottom of the Wii Remote, four blue LED lights indicate which player position the remote is currently set to. The controller automatically connects to the Wii console via Bluetooth wireless technology. Below the LEDs, an expansion port lets you connect a number of devices including the Nunchuck and Classic controllers for Virtual Console gaming (Virtual Console games and controller accessories sold separately). Other features of the Wii Remote include adjustable rumble force-feedback and a reinforced wrist strap to ensure safe use. A speaker inside the remote gives the player feedback about the strength of swings or the accuracy of their moves- such as realistic tennis noises as the ""racket"" connects with the ball in <i>Wii Sports</i>. Overall, the physical design of the remote is extremely sturdy and of very high quality, ensuring countless hours of Wii gaming fun!', '']","by

Smaller backs escape and break tackles, while bigger runners bowl over defenders in the open field Scout collegiate prospects with the all-new NFL Draft Scouting System and during the College All-Star Game. Watch players impact their teams with the new Franchise Player Roles feature Team-Specific Defensive Playbooks. For the first time, use actual plays from your favorite team's defensive playbook to shut down the running game, pressure the quarterback, or force key turnovers."", ""<b>A fine balance of reflex and power</b><br> The running game is where FreeMotion control especially shines, mostly because rushing the ball is truly a test of anticipation, reaction and power. As you run, you can see what tacklers stand in your way. Once they're close enough, that's when you react, whether you juke or blast them with a stiff arm. Once they think they have you wrapped up, sometimes you've given the chance to power through them by pushing both controllers forward. There's something extremely satisfying about physically planting a stiff arm in someone's facemask. You can't get that in any other football game."", ""Defense also gets a FreeMotion upgrade as pushing the controllers forward can help you deliver the big hit. When you're playing in the secondary, flicking the remote will give your defender a chance to swat at the ball. It's this level of integration that really revolutionizes <i>Madden NFL 07</i> without forsaking the gameplay elements gamers have come accustomed to. Overall, the football franchise dives into the end zone and scores with a motion system that gets gamers in the game without going over the top.""]","by

This parasitic species infects other life forms with a virus that rapidly mutates victims into new Chimera. In mere decades this race has ripped apart populations across Asia and Europe and by 1951 has landed on the shores of England. You play the part of US a Army Ranger, fighting alongside a group of British resistance soldiers to free the country from the Chimera and to halt their spread across the globe.', '<b>The Chimera wars</b><br> War is everywhere and everything in Resistance. An alien race began toying with the planet just after Word War I and in mere decades, the Chimera &#x2568; a species of unknown origin propagating a virus that converts other life forms into more Chimera &#x2568; has overrun Russia and all of Europe. Humanity&#x2552;s hope for survival is slim, and the tide of the battle rests on the shoulders of U.S. Army Ranger, Sgt. Nathan Hale.', ""The Chimera didn't plan to take this protracted war lying down, however, and amassed their forces in Russia. Once Russia was captured, they quickly erected a wall around the former country, rebuking all efforts at communication or contact. While the world waited and wondered what other terrors might spill from the wall, England prepares for and falls to a major Chimera invasion in 1951."", ""The United States comes to aid their English allies, but all does not go as planned. The next three days will see some of the most intense fighting the war has known thus far, and it's up to you to end the Chimera threat before the plague of defeat can encircle the globe."", '<b>Next-generation gameplay and style</b><br> The gameplay of Resistance is classic First Person Shooter. Insomniac Games has combined its passion for creating exotic weapons and vehicles with a proprietary physics system to create unique human and alien weaponry. Many of the weapons of the game are era-appropriate, such as pistols and grenades. Other weapons, such as the Chimeran Auger, are of alien design. Due to the differences in the ways that the various weapons handle, great care must be taken when entering an area infested with Chimera with their own weaponry. In addition to the obvious array of weapons, players can use melee attacks and jump to avoid attack.', 'Special game actions, called ""Skill Tasks,"" are worth set number of points that can be spent to unlock new content in the game. A Skill Task may be something as simple as killing a number of enemies in a short period of time or as involved as locating a hidden area in the single player campaign. The mystery of the tasks, however, is that they aren\'t actually revealed until you have completed the task. This makes for a great reply incentive, as you will be mowing down Chimera and be suddenly rewarded with task points, often when you least expect the reward.', ""Obviously, presentation is one of the areas in which Resistance shines. The frame rate is silky-smooth, and never seems to get bogged down when there is a large number of Chimera or teammates on screen. Animations are believable, the locations are detailed, and the voice acting is top-notch. Explosions are especially impressive, sending shrapnel and smoke in all directions. If you're looking for a game to impress your friends with graphically, look no further. Resistance is the type of game that makes you feel confident about the future of the PLAYSTATION 3."", '<b>Track stats and more online</b><br> Resistance also boasts an impressive 40 player online multiplayer mode.
