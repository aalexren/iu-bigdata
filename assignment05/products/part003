Toriyama is also known as the creator of the immensely popular Dragon Ball cartoons and comics. A prequel to the first two games in the series, <I>DWIII</I> casts you as the child of a great hero who must defeat an evil demon. New additions to the port include improved graphics, new minigames, new items, and a better translation of the original Japanese dialogue."", 'The game starts off with a personality test that loosely determines how other characters will react to you. Gameplay is standard RPG fare: exploring, building experience levels, acquiring allies, gaining weapons, and ultimately going after a large monster. There are some interesting minigames to mix things up. The Monster Medals feature adds a collectible aspect to the game. Monsters may leave medals behind after you defeat them. Some monsters only appear during certain times of the day. Getting all the medals unlocks a secret dungeon. You can trade medals via link cable to make things easier. Most RPG fans will love this game, but those raised on modern RPGs might find its combat a bit tedious. This game is compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance only. <I>--Raymond M.

While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as it is to deter would-be software pirates."", ""Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers--Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can only play Nintendo games on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started with <I>Donkey Kong</I>. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario, Legend of Zelda, Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, and <I>Star Wars</I>."", ""The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming."", ""In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles.

These were violent and passionate times to be sure, perfect for a historical strategy game that thrives on brutality, dynasty, and war.', ""There are three time periods to choose from, the earliest of which features more fragmented factions and primitive weaponry, the last represents a more unified period where most power struggles have been decided and gunpowder has entered the scene. With three time periods and 12 factions representing three different religions, there's a lot of replay value in the strategic game alone."", ""Like <I>Shogun</I>, the game is divided into two parts: strategic and tactical. The strategic part features a map of Europe, some of Asia, and some of Africa. It's divided into territories  la Risk or Axis & Allies, and each territory represents a kingdom. Each faction begins with its own holdings and must quickly begin to out produce and conquer its neighbors. Each kingdom has its own population, loyalty rating, economy, and religious affiliations. Installing a feared or loved general as governor can enhance the kingdom, but giving an unscrupulous general the job could lead to revolt. Building structures can enhance the kingdom as well; a dock or a salt or silver mine can lead to riches while a castle protects. A bowyer or spear maker can outfit new troops. As time progresses, your king will grow old, have children, and die. If he dies without a male heir a revolution can occur. Daughters are used primarily to reward your governors and generals or offered to allies as wives."", 'The tactical portion of the game is the 3-D battlefield, complete with deserts, rivers, rolling hills, forests, mountains, and the vast rainy plains of England. It is here that you will decide the fate of your empire. You have to use terrain effectively to win, managing your varied troops with efficiency and skill: pikemen against mounted troops, mounted troops against archers, archers against pikemen. The specialized troop types of the Turkish, Byzantine, French, and other cultures offer unique abilities and open up combat options to wily generals. Guiding the actions of thousands of meticulously researched troops and watching them execute historical military maneuvers on a giant battlefield is a joy, but if deep tactical combat is not to your liking, you can skip individual battles or have the computer control them for you. Creative Assembly added sieges to the game as well, and those can be spectacular undertakings--complete with castle walls, sorties, and machines of war. A multiplayer option is offered, but only using the tactical battle engine. There are also a few warfare only historical battles and scenarios.', ""The two halves of the game make a rich whole. The AI is sharp, and a sense of history permeates the game.

Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces.

Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly).

The achievement of <i>Vice City</i> (which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, <i>Miami Vice</i>-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessor <i>Grand Theft Auto 3</i> never dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that made <i>GTA3</i> the bestselling PS2 game of all time.', ""After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place.

Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (in <i>GTA3</i>, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where in <i>GTA3</i> missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do."", 'There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times).

You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator.

Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation."", 'Despite minor imperfections <i>SimCity 4</i> is an awesome game.

Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.', 'While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while, <i>Ratchet and Clank</i> keeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.', ""If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality. <i>--David Stoesz</i>""]","by

Welcome to a world where your presence affects everything else. From the physical environment to the behaviors and emotions of both friends and enemies, every move has a consequence. Enjoy the unique combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Characters can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand. Lush and realistic environments - objects obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity and buoyancy. System requirements: Windows, 700 MHz processor, 128 MB RAM, DirectX 6.0 compatible graphics card/accelerator.', 'In many ways, creating a sequel to <i>Half-Life</i> is an unenviable task. After all, the goal is to craft not just any ordinary game, but an improvement to a title that is widely considered to be the high water mark for first person shooters. Fortunately, Valve does not disappoint on their sophomore effort.', ""<i>Half-Life 2</i> picks up exactly where its predecessor leaves off, with gamers stepping once more into Gordon Freeman's HVAC suit as he awakes at some indeterminate time in the future, now apparently in the employ of the mysterious G-Man. Humanity has been sold out to alien forces, and your job is to escape their thrall and lead the resistance to victory."", ""<i>HL2</i>'s key successes are in a few critical areas, the first of which is the new physics & graphics engine, called Source. People and objects fall, fly, tip over, float, and break in an extraordinarily realistic fashion, and in-game puzzles often require you to use simple applications of physics to progress. Second, an elaborate facial structure system coupled with excellent voice acting make for some of the most believably human NPCs in gaming history. This is no small thing; you will find yourself actually caring about the characters who surround you, even those that are normally regarded as cannon fodder. Third, the level design exhibits a subtle brilliance, which frequently fools you into feeling like you're making your way through an organic environment and not a forced linear path. These elements combine to form one of the most truly immersive experiences ever captured on a PC."", ""This gaming bliss comes at a cost, however.

It gets repetitive, but the game has some clever tricks in its floppy hat. For example, skulls make noise, so Indy can toss a few and watch crocodiles target them instead of him.', ""Indy can execute quick punch combinations to knock his foes out, or he can pick up weapons such as a chair, plank of wood, machete, or firearm. His famous whip can be used to disarm foes. The only problem is the camera, which is difficult to keep in the right position--you have complete control of it, but it's hard to manage a camera while you're fighting a martial arts expert, a Nazi with a gun, or a poacher keen on decapitating Indy."", ""The graphics are good, pleasantly reminding you of some of the movies' more memorable locales. The in-game Indy mug looks like Harrison Ford down to the chin scar. Other nice touches include how Indy has to actually pick up his hat if it falls off during a fight, and the little '30s plane flying over the aged and weathered world map. The music is pure John Williams, and the voice work is handled by convincing imitators. The guy they got for Indy, in particular, sounds a lot like Ford himself. Sadly no other movie characters of note appear in the game. (I was looking for John Rhys-Davies at least, because he seems to be in every video game that comes out.)"", ""<I>Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb</I> does right by its license and provides hours of entertainment for anyone who's ever wanted to relive the movies starring the most exciting adventurer alive.

Red Faction (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['As we made ourselves comfortable in the demo room for THQ\'s unveiling of <I>Red Faction</I>, I figured I\'d get the toughest question out of the way straight off. ""So, what is it about this game that\'s going to set it apart from everything else?"" Without hesitation, Rob Loftus, the Associate Producer, responded, ""Take a look at this!"" Half an hour later, I had come to the conclusion that the genre of first-person-shooters was about to get a much-needed kick in the pants. <P>What was it, you ask, that convinced me that <I>Red Faction</I> will make a very big splash when it hits store shelves next year? It\'s a new-fangled bit of code called Geo-Mod -- essentially the engine that will power <I>Red Faction</I>. What this brilliant new piece of programming brings to the table is the ability to perform real-time, arbitrary geometry modification. Don\'t worry -- when I first heard that phrase I had no idea what it meant either. Simply put, this engine is capable of simulating advanced physics effects on the environment - if you shoot something you put a hole in it relative to the size and trajectory of the projectile that hit it. <P>For instance, you can fire a rocket into the ground and it will leave a crater (to be used as a solitary fox hole). Fire off a few more rockets into the same hole and you\'ll have a nice little trench for yourself to hide in. In other words, the environments are completely blow-up-able (for lack of a better description). Of course, it goes much deeper than shooting holes in the ground. Is that sniper in the tower bugging you? No problem... blow up the tower\'s base and watch the little camper fall from his nest to a (well deserved) death. Stuck in a room and no keycard/key/lock combination? Blow a hole through the wall. Need to get inside a pipe? Blast it open. The possibilities are endless. As Alan Lawrence, Lead Designer for <I>Red Faction</I> puts it, ""We wanted to give the player the power to destroy whatever he wants, not just pre-determined objects."" To emphasize the level of Volition\'s achievement in getting this engine functional, Epic Game\'s tech guru, Tim Sweeney, had described deformable terrain as ""the holy grail of first-person gaming."" From this showing, Volition ""chose wisely"".<P><b>The Physics of Liquids and Gases</b><br>Structures aren\'t the only things that you can realistically interact with in <I>Red Faction</I>; liquids and gases also behave as they would in real life. If you see a stream of water, you can fire a rocket into the side of that stream and the water will flow into the new hole you just made. You can even completely redirect that stream of water and make it go anywhere you want. Smoke from pipes will travel in the direction that the wind is blowing and sparks from electricity will bounce off the floor. None of this is pre-scripted; it\'s all on the fly. Even your bullet casings will bounce off surfaces realistically. For every action, there\'s a perfect reaction delivered by this impressive engine. Blow the support columns of a bridge and it will collapse, crushing any and all enemies beneath it. Needless to say, the Geo-Mod engine is unlike anything we\'ve ever seen before.<P>However, as an old wise man once said (actually, it was just Rob Smith), ""What good is an engine without a killer game to go with it?"" Luckily, Volition has proven time and again that it is a very capable development house. After all, it did bring us the excellent <I>Freespace</I> games. With <I>Red Faction</I> the group plans on surpassing anything it\'s done in the past with the goal of dethroning the current king of first-person-shooters, <I>Half-Life</I>. To do this, a full-time writer is tasked with ensuring a deep and involving storyline. There will be in-game cut scenes, as well as in-game dialogue to keep the narrative going and draw you in. As Lawrence put it, ""We\'re focused on creating a realistic and consistent world for <I>Red Faction</I>, with the goal of creating the most immersive FPS to date.""<P>The story follows a man named Parker, a miner on Mars who works for a large conglomerate known as the Ultor Corporation. Apparently, a deadly disease known as The Plague [that pro writer is earning his corn! -Ed] is spreading through the miner population. Already stuck with inhumane living conditions, the miners decide that this is the final straw. A rebellion breaks out and Parker gets caught up in an epic struggle to bring down the Ultor Corporation and find a cure for the deadly plague. Of course, this won\'t be easy; Ultor is a very large company with great influence, power, and almost unlimited resources. And like any megalomaniacal conglomerate worth its salt, it reeks of pure evil. As should be expected, Ultor uses its influences to bring in a group of mercenaries to stamp out the rebellion.<P>So what\'s a poor miner to do when faced with overwhelming odds? Get guns, of course...lots of guns. While the list of available weapons is not finalized yet, it has been confirmed that there will be around 15 of them. Definitely making the line-up are a handgun, an assault rifle, a sniper rifle, and a rocket launcher, and the others will maintain similarities with real world weapons. Volition plans to ensure that all the weapons will have a satisfying and visceral impact - a direct result of the responses to Epic\'s <I>Unreal</I>. The assault rifle fires either in bursts or at full-auto, and has a very distinct chatter that will be instantly familiar to anyone who has been exposed to the real thing (and lived!). <P>The sniper rifle is fairly standard issue, but is sure to please. The true head-turner will be the rocket launcher. This compact tool of destruction comes complete with its own infrared scanner. A screen attached to the launcher displays a red glob whenever an object that gives off heat is in range. This allows you literally to see through walls. For example, you could be walking down a hallway watching the scanner and spot the bad guys, even if they\'re hiding behind something. You can then use the rocket launcher to blast through the wall and take that sorry sod out to pasture. Of course, the infrared scanner will have a limited range. Volition is still hard at work on the rest of the arsenal, but you can be assured that the final lineup will be more than adequate for your fragging needs.<P>Finally, there are the vehicles: submarines, APCs, and various flying vehicles round out the selection. You can use the APC to ram through walls, and it also has a mortar mounted on it to get rid of other pesky barriers. One of the most impressive parts of the demo was the underwater sequence where piloting submarines serves up some deep-sea action. The effects are incredible and will remind many gamers of <I>The Abyss</I> (but not that crappy ending). Enemy subs actually implode when destroyed and the light sources are incredible. There\'s even plankton in the water to help give you a sense of motion.<P>With a promising storyline and the Geo-Mod engine in its corner, this could be one of the biggest hits of 2001. The engine should open up previously unexplored areas in the genre and add some much-needed innovation. If the rest of the development schedule is as productive as what\'s already been accomplished, we\'ll have to dust off some of the superlatives reserved for the likes of <I>Half-Life</I>. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>']","by

In his newest adventure, Sunshine for Nintendo, Mario visits a tropical island and is mistaken for a local outlaw. Use your new Nintendo GameCube to hose down enemies and meet the locals in this colorful, action-packed adventure set in sprawling 3D. The new GameCube is the first video game console to access game data from a disk, not a cartridge. The processor and disk drive perform together at lightening speed to make load times imperceptible. To top it off, you also get a Nintendo GameCube Memory Card. With 4MB of flash memory, you bring your saved characters, special weapons, vehicles, high scores, unlocked levels and custom settings with you wherever you go.', '<blockquote><I>This special Nintendo GameCube bundle includes the 3-D adventure game&#xA0;</I>Super Mario Sunshine<I>. In&#xA0;</I>Super Mario Sunshine<I>, players chase a vandal who has been spreading graffiti around an island paradise and framing Mario for the misdeeds. The bundle also includes a Memory Card 59 so you can save your progress through the game.</I></blockquote>', ""Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others."", ""For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum."", ""The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (<I>Pikmin</I>, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates."", ""Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started with <I>Donkey Kong</I>. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario, <i>Legend of Zelda</i>, <i>Perfect Dark</i>, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, and <I>Star Wars</I>."", ""The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming."", ""In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat. <I>--Porter B.

This game is still strongly recommended, but with many caveats. Proceed with caution and you're likely to enjoy yourself. Expect a masterpiece and you'll be wishing you saved your money for a different PS2 title. <i>--Jennifer Buckendorff</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b>', '']","by

You'll have to battle Nazis and the Chinese underground as well in this globe-spanning adventure."", '""If adventure has a name, it must be Indiana Jones."" So says the <i>Temple of Doom</i> movie poster, and--Lara Croft notwithstanding--Indiana Jones is still synonymous with glory, romance, treasure, and adventure. Previous Indiana Jones games were produced by the graphic-adventure game masters at LucasArts. This latest installment is an action-oriented romp made by the Collective, the same development house that produced the critically acclaimed <i><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V6BG/${0}"">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></i> for Xbox. The <i>Buffy</i> game engine is a good fit for Indy, as he travels the world on a quest to prevent the discovery of an ancient Chinese secret that could spell the end of creation itself.', 'Such a quest should be easy for an adventurer like Indy, and with game controls that are as well laid out as these, it is easy. Indy can run, jump, shimmy up ropes, swing with his whip, and duke it out with nasty villains. True to the movies, Indy also has to navigate an almost constant stream of deathtraps. Caves full of traps, ruins full of traps, medieval castles filled with traps, and guess what you find in China, yes, more traps. It gets repetitive, but the game has some clever tricks in its floppy hat. For example, skulls make noise, so Indy can toss a few and watch crocodiles target them instead of him.', ""Indy can execute quick punch combinations to knock his foes out, or he can pick up weapons such as a chair, plank of wood, machete, or firearm. His famous whip can be used to disarm foes. The only problem is the camera, which is difficult to keep in the right position--you have complete control of it, but it's hard to manage a camera while you're fighting a martial arts expert, a Nazi with a gun, or a poacher keen on decapitating Indy."", ""The graphics are good, pleasantly reminding you of some of the movies' more memorable locales. The in-game Indy mug looks like Harrison Ford down to the chin scar. Other nice touches include how Indy has to actually pick up his hat if it falls off during a fight, and the little '30s plane flying over the aged and weathered world map. The music is pure John Williams, and the voice work is handled by convincing imitators. The guy they got for Indy, in particular, sounds a lot like Ford himself. Sadly no other movie characters of note appear in the game. (I was looking for John Rhys-Davies at least, because he seems to be in every video game that comes out.)"", ""<i>Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb</i> does right by its license and provides hours of entertainment for anyone who's ever wanted to relive the movies starring the most exciting adventurer alive.

What\'s new to the game are the different ""grooves,"" or fighting styles. Although the ""Capcom"" and ""SNK"" grooves were introduced in a previous game, Capcom VS SNK 2 takes this concept a step further by introducing six different grooves: C, A, P, S, N, and K. Depending on which groove you choose, the type and number of fighting techniques you have available changes, with half of the grooves leaning towards traditional Capcom fighting and the other half leaning towards SNK-styled battle. The difference between the two fighting styles is mainly the availability of certain non-lethal moves such as air blocks, dodging, and rolling, with each groove having its own balanced mixture of the said moves.', 'For much of the 90s the 2-D realm consisted of a battle between Capcoms stars and the 2-D fighters from rival SNK.

Theres a lot to learn and it ensures that playing a foe of equal skill is never dull because you can never be sure what character hes going to pick and how that character will fight.', 'The graphics are generally decent, though some of these fighters look like they havent been spiffed up for todays console systems. The older Street Fighter guys look just plain bad next to newly added characters from the SNK stable. But the animation is smooth, the backgrounds have been significantly redone and feature new, often startling animations, and the special effects are just plain awesome. The audio is pretty much the same old themes that Capcom has been using for the better part of a decade now.', 'All told theres very little reason for PS2 or GameCube gamers to own this game, other than the SNK characters.

Includes matching battery cover and screen in good shape. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', ""The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design, which allowed devotees to play video games around their schedules, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike."", ""Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as its already being called) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun on one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have a copy of the game."", ""What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Since the Game Boy Advance system is backward compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--like such launch titles as <I>Super Mario Advance</I>, <I>F-Zero: Maximum Velocity</I>, <I>Army Men Advance</I>, <I>High Heat Major League Baseball 2002</I>, <I>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</I>, and <I>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2</I>--as well as all the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 of them in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition of <I>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</I> and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see."", ""When you first pick up the system, you'll wonder how they got it to be so incredibly lightweight. At a little less than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during game play. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see."", ""Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen."", ""But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon."", ""Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago.

You must infiltrate the transport and foil their evil plans.', '<i>Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance</i> is the PS2 espionage action game <i><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005ML10/${0}"">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></i> with new playable characters, new VR missions, and a few twists. More than 350 new and moderately interesting VR missions fill in some of the gaps in the original game\'s story. There are also five separate ""Snake Stories"" that act as new missions. These take place apart from the main story, making them feel less like an expansion to the sprawling events in <i>Sons of Liberty</i> and more like an unconnected romp designed to pad the original game. Unfortunately, the ""Snake Stories"" lack the thrill, tension, and exposition that made <i>Sons of Liberty</i> so special.', 'The ""substance"" is nothing more or less than a collection of disconnected additions to the core game <i>Sons of Liberty</i>, which remains unchanged from its original release: you play as Solid Snake in stealthy espionage/assault missions, infiltrating the lairs of bad guys to take down nuclear-powered bipedal creations called Metal Gears. Snake has all kinds of tricks up his sleeves: high tech weapons, the ability to sneak around undetected--he can even flip over the side of a railing to hide (a ""Grip Meter"" counts down, increasing the tension and making you pray the enemy walks away). Both a boon and a detriment to the game is its reliance on cinematic scenes to further the convoluted plot. They\'re well-rendered and professionally done, but you\'ll seemingly find yourself spending more time watching the game than playing it.', ""<i>Substance</i> is worthwhile for anyone who doesn't already own <i>Sons of Liberty</i>. That goes double for Xbox and GameCube fans, because the game looks much better on those consoles than it did on PS2. For those who've already played the original, this reissue just doesn't add enough, pardon me, substance, to merit purchasing it again. <i>--Bob Andrews</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b>', '']",Konami,"['>#12,398 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#311 in Video Games &gt; More Systems &gt; PlayStation 2 &gt; Games']",$84.99,Video Games,B00007KUU8

The bad guys, called the Black Mantis, are: Wulong Goth, looking crazy in a praying mantis costume; the mystical Fatalist; the alluring Divinity; the scary Geist; and a hulking brute named Exile. Each fighter has his own fighting style, powers, and core strategy, and the game design is such that you have to relearn the game with each new fighter.', 'The slower pace of the fighting in <I>Tao Feng</I> might put off genre fans looking for something more frantic. The controls are simple and include a few innovations. For example: pushing back on the gamepad blocks, but too much blocking might result in losing the use of your limbs. The rest of the buttons are two basic punches, two kicks, all modified by the direction you press and the use of the shoulder buttons and jumping attacks. You can even taunt your foe, which, like hitting them, charges your Chi bar. Chi can be unleashed in a devastating attack with the white button, and this attack is also modified by how you use the direction pad. The result is a fluid game of blocking, striking, and stringing combos, and occasionally taking advantage of your Chi powers to take out your opponent.', 'The game looks great and features arenas filled with hazards and breakable objects. The only problem with the game is that some animation bugs didn&#x92;t get squashed before the game shipped--when executing attacks, characters sometimes instantly jerk into a new stance.
