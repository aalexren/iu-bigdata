Take control of the amazing Infinity Gem system which grants super-powers such as healing extra attacking strength and infinite super attacks. Master a variety of fantastic attacks super moves and tons of multi-hit combos. For comic book fanatics and fighting game warriors alike Marvel Super Heroes is a must-play masterpiece!"", ""Marvel Super Heroes is a Street Fighter Alpha-style fighting game that features characters from the classic Marvel Comics lineup. Four characters (Psylocke, Wolverine, Juggernaut, and Magneto) return from Capcom's previous comic-based fighter, X-Men: Children of the Atom. New characters include Captain America, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hulk, and more. It was an exciting arcade game, but the PlayStation version lacks any real punch and falls flat by comparison. <P>The game differs from the pack via its inclusion of gems that litter the landscape. You can pick up the gems and use them on command, resulting in brief power-ups to the character's speed, power, life, etc. Other than that, it's just basic Street Fighter action, complete with fireballs, dragon punches, and the like. The arcade version was a great game and differed enough from the Street Fighter and X-Men games to be entertaining. The PlayStation version has virtually the same gameplay. <P>Graphically, MSH looks all right. The characters and backgrounds are large and colorful. But the game also produces an awful lot of slowdown, and it's missing quite a few frames of character and background animation. The slowdown is even more apparent when picking larger characters such as Juggernaut and Blackheart. The music in MSH is fairly good and the speech is nice and crisp, unlike the Saturn version, which produced tinny, annoying sound effects. <P>The PlayStation version of MSH is tolerable, but it lost the arcade game's soul in the translation. The missing frames and slowdown don't help much, either. While I found the arcade game a blast, this version just seemed dull and boring. Whether this can be attributed to the translation itself or the fact that several, mostly better, Capcom fighters have been released in arcades since Marvel, I don't know. Rent it first and see if it's your thing, and for all of you who own both a PlayStation and a Saturn, you're slightly better off getting the Saturn version, as it doesn't slow down as much, has better color, and more frames of animation. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Originally, this was the Diggers' only purpose; to find refractors so that civilization would endure. However over the years, the story of an incredible treasure, the legendary Mother Lode, began to be whispered among the Diggers. The Mother Lode...a treasure so great that were it discovered, it would provide so much power that the world need never fear of running out of energy."", ""In search of this Mother Lode, Diggers travel from one island to another in their flying machines ever hoping that they'll find what they seek just over the horizon.

He named the baby Mega Man Voulnut, and raised him with his granddaughter Roll. Fourteen years have passed since the disappearance of Roll's parents while they were excavating a site. Mega Man and Roll have followed in the footsteps of Roll's parents in an effort to both discover the truth of their mysterious disappearance and to find the long lost family treasure...the Mother Lode.""]",Capcom,"['>#15,792 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#142 in Video Games > More Systems > PlayStation > Games']",$147.47,Video Games,B000006OVJ

Breath of Fire III,,['Breath of Fire'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Breath of Fire III is a role-playing video game developed and published by Capcom originally for the PlayStation console as part of the Breath of Fire series. It is the first game in the franchise to feature three-dimensional graphics and voice acting. The story takes place in a fantasy world where humans live alongside anthropomorphic creatures, and centers the story on Ryu, the last of The Brood (a race of people who can transform into powerful dragons), as he searches the world to uncover the mystery of his people and reunite with his surrogate family. Ryu's journey takes him into adulthood where he is joined by a number of other characters who aid him in his quest. Breath of Fire III is notable as being one of the few RPGs that don't feature a major villain in its story, only having minor ones for some of the game's segments."", 'In most role-playing games, the player finds himself in the role of an adventurer who, sooner or later, must meet and defeat a fire-breathing dragon. But in a nice change of pace, Capcom\'s new RPG Breath of Fire III allows you to be adventurer and dragon all rolled into one.  <P>You play Ryu (or whatever you want to call him - the game leaves it up to you), the last of a race of beings who once sought to rule the world. A dragon that appears in the form of a young boy most of the time, Ryu travels the globe in a quest to reunite with two friends. But as his journey unfolds, he uncovers the truth behind their disappearances, as well as a larger plot of unspeakable evil - one that only Ryu can stop.  <P>RPG fans have heard this kind of story before, and in many respects, they\'ve played this game before. Breath of Fire III has all the standard RPG trappings: the ""you hit me, now I hit you"" combat engine, control over a multiple-character party, and a number of smaller quests you have to accomplish along the way to finishing the overall one. This is not necessarily a criticism. Innovation is none too common in the world of RPGs, and even ""cutting-edge"" examples such as Final Fantasy VII stay pretty much within the narrow path beaten by their predecessors. But Breath of Fire III does bring a few fresh offerings to the table, such as its ""examine"" command, fishing minigame, masters\' apprenticeship, and, most notably, its dragon gene system.  <P>The examine command is an option you can choose for any or all of your characters during battle. It instructs them to watch their enemies as they perform specialized attacks - and if they\'re lucky, pick up the attack as their own, which often comes in handy in later battles. Whenever you decide to visit a fishing spot, a fishing minigame provides you with the chance to catch different status-enhancing fish (eating a rainbow trout restores magic points, blowfish cure poison, and so on). It\'s kind of fun and doesn\'t take up too much time, making it pretty much like any other minigame found in a RPG, but hey, it\'s fishing! Apprenticing to one of the world\'s masters entails different requirements for each master, such as providing a certain item, money, or nothing at all, and pays off in status bonuses that sometimes take away a few points from other areas as well. When it comes down to it, it\'s just another way to build up your characters, though the variety\'s nice.  <P>The dragon gene system is one of the most notable features of the title. Instead of just turning into one dragon, Ryu can become every dragon by combining different dragon stones found throughout the game. The more powerful the form he takes on, the more magic points get sucked up each round of battle, and the more quickly he reverts back to boyhood. The key is to find the right balance of strength, breath attacks, and stamina. With 18 stones in all, you can spend a lot of time experimenting with different combinations and effects. <P>Graphically, Breath of Fire III straddles the line between 2D and 3D, with sprite-based graphics in an isometric 3D environment. The effect breathes some life, if not fire, into the traditional RPG look, sort of like Konami\'s Suikoden with a greater feeling of depth. It\'s an interesting attempt, but the style is a little too cartoonish for my liking. The soundtrack is above average, with a variety of tracks ranging from the expected epic style to what\'s best summed up as ""RPG lounge.""  <P>Not everything is right in fantasyland though, since the game has a habit of forcing you through needless, time-wasting sequences. Random encounters happen far too frequently in Breath of Fire III, somewhere within the beat of every 30 seconds when in a hostile environment. While you can often flee, this severely inhibits your desire to explore your surroundings and gives the game a Beyond the Beyond-like quality. Also, having to build characters up inch by inch over hours of beating up weakling monsters so that your party is strong enough to survive a big fight can be extremely tedious and boring. While there are certainly plenty of things to do in the game and it\'s quite long in terms of the number of play hours, much of that time is less enjoyable than it should be. If the examine command were a little easier to pull off successfully and the frequency of random encounters turned down a notch or two, many of these problems would be solved.  <P>Even with its handful of new features, Breath of Fire III breaks little new ground. Die-hard RPG fans may find it entertaining, but those looking for something new in this increasingly static genre will come away disappointed. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

All of her actions are intricately modeled to produce the lifelike athleticism that made <i>Tomb Raider</i>--and Lara Croft--famous.', ""But Lara's got more than good looks and smooth moves to help her on her globetrotting quest for relics. Like guns. Lots of guns. Lara begins her adventures with her trademark pistols, wielded John Woo-style: one in each hand. She eventually works her way up to Uzis and even adds a handy shotgun to her arsenal, perfect for taking down a troublesome tyrannosaur found in some steamy Tibetan lost world."", ""Here's the story: having made a name for herself as a finder of antiquities, Lara is hired by a mysterious woman to find an artifact believed to have come from Atlantis. Lara travels around the world, plumbing the depths of long- or best-forgotten locales. As she discovers clues to the artifact's whereabouts, she also uncovers the true motivation behind her employer's search. The intriguing plot is told through gorgeous computer animation movie cutscenes interspersed throughout the game's episodes."", 'As you venture to and through various ancient tombs, a host of enemies and puzzles await you. In fact, it is the puzzles that will keep players interested even after the challenge of slaying enemies has passed. Also hidden throughout the game are a number of secret rooms and hidden treasures, unnecessary for completion of the game but adding a level of complexity and replay value.', 'Being one of the few video game characters to grace mainstream magazine covers, Lara Croft is part of video game history.

Fighting Force,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['TAKE IT OUTSIDE! Fighting Forces delivers unparalled actions tons of attack moves in a fully progressive 3D environment.', ""Fighting Force, from the same developers that brought us Tomb Raider, looked very promising from the early reports. It looked like it was going to be the ultimate beat-'em-up game, redefining the genre for the 32-bit and up systems. Unfortunately, the game starts strong, but becomes an exercise in futility on or around the second level. <P>The game allows four character choices, each with its own strengths. Actually, it doesn't really matter which character you pick. They may have different attacks and throws, but they're all pretty interchangeable. The typical array of punches, kicks, and grabs are here. All the players also have a special attack that clears out all the enemies around them at the cost of a little bit of their life bar. Needless to say, originality is not one of Fighting Force's strong points. The game is basically a 3D version of Capcom's classic, Final Fight, except the characters and enemies lack the personality that made Final Fight exciting. Also, the use of a 3D environment causes a few problems. The most notable of these is that armed enemies have the ability to shoot you from off-screen. <P>Graphically, Fighting Force does the job. The characters move well and look detailed, albeit a bit blocky. The backgrounds are decent, but seem a little too static. Perhaps a little more animation could have been used to spruce the game's atmosphere up a bit. The sound doesn't help very much here either. It's tolerable, but that's about it. <P>Playing the game is simple, although it could have been a little simpler. Core chose to assign multiple tasks to a single button, even though there are plenty of free buttons on the PlayStation controller. As a result, trying to grab someone will sometimes cause your player to execute a reverse attack, leaving him wide open for punishment. This doesn't really matter, however, since you only really need to use one button to play the game anyway. In fact, you can even beat the game's final boss simply by walking up to him and pounding on the X button until he is dead. He will simply block your attacks, taking a small amount of damage each time you hit him. He won't be able to hit back, even with the game set on hard. You don't even have to bother looking at the screen. The rest of the game is pretty easy, although you'll have to actually walk around a little bit. The only neat thing about Fighting Force is that there are a few different branches of levels depending on which way you go. <P>All in all, I can't recommend purchasing Fighting Force unless you're prepared for an uninspired stab at making a 3D Final Fight or Streets of Rage. If you are an absolute beat-'em-up fiend, then check it out, but prepare yourself for an easy, flawed game. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Ninja: Shadow of Darkness,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""When an evil warlord sells his soul to rule feudal Japan, a young ninja emerges to battle the army of trolls, goblins, and evil spirits he unleashes. To defeat the warlord, you must utilize your fists, feet, and magical powers to traverse ten deadly levels, filled with merciless enemies and treacherous physical hazards. Unlike another recent ninja title, Activision's excellent Tenchu: Stealth Assassins, Eidos's Ninja: Shadow of Darkness makes no attempt at strategy; rather, it is an arcade-style beat-em-up that harks back to such relics as Double Dragon or Streets of Rage. Although the graphics are three-dimensional, the play mechanics remain roughly the same (walk right, kick the snot out of a couple of guys, walk right...). Core gamely attempts to mix things up by throwing in some wicked physical hazards, cool-looking ninja spells, and simple puzzle elements, but it's not enough to make Ninja more than a prospective rental. Although the game's dynamic camera does a good job of following the action, the control is stiff, resulting in numerous accidental deaths. Worse, your physical attacks are limited to simple kicks and punches; you can't even throw anybody! And you can forget about smacking somebody upside the head with a fire hydrant or an engine block (never mind the fact they didn't have fire hydrants or engine blocks in feudal Japan) like you could in another recent Eidos title, Fighting Force. At best, you may come across a sword or smoke bomb. Despite its best efforts, Eidos is cementing its reputation as a one-franchise company. A few more stumbles like Ninja: Shadow of Darkness, and the house that Lara built could come tumbling down as quickly as it was erected.  <I>--Gary Mollohan </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

WWF Warzone,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['NEW', 'Professional wrestling is huge. People who cut their teeth on the Rock and Wrestling era of the WWF are returning in droves, and the industry is doing better than it ever has before. Games based on wrestling have progressed through the years, and while WWF War Zone plays similarly to its predecessors, it presents a package that is completely unmatched in both gameplay and in atmosphere. <P>Most of the WWF\'s biggest stars are represented, including Steve Austin, the Undertaker, Kane, Mankind, the Rock, Triple H, and Ken Shamrock. Since the beginning of the game\'s development, Bret Hart, Ahmed Johnson, and the British Bulldog have left the WWF, but they remain in the game. A few hidden wrestlers are also in the game, most notably Mankind\'s other personalities, Dude Love and Cactus Jack. <P>There are several different modes in War Zone. The challenge mode is the game\'s main mode, putting your wrestler in a quest to win the championship belt. Along the way you\'ll be challenged to grudge matches by the wrestlers you\'ve wronged during your career. These grudge matches come in the form of the game\'s two other modes. Weapons matches are falls-anywhere, no-rules kinds of matches, where smacking your opponent with a two-by-four and suplexing him onto a table are the order of the day. The cage match forces you to beat your opponent, then climb out of the cage while he\'s too dazed to do anything about it. Once you\'ve won the belt in challenge mode, the game continues with you defending the belt against various challengers. There is also a really good tag-team mode that contains most of the four-man action from the real thing. Multiplayer modes include a free-for-all, cooperative cage matches, and tornado mode. There is also a comprehensive training mode, but it isn\'t as useful as the manual would have you believe. <P>War Zone plays, essentially, like every other wrestling game out there. But the control has been refined to a point of perfection, and a complicated tie-up system keeps people from doing cheap, low-damage moves over and over again. The game controls very tightly, and while you will do some button mashing to break holds and pins, it is kept to a minimum. <P>The graphics in War Zone are better than any other PlayStation wrestling game. Some of the characters (the Undertaker, for instance) look eerily like their real-life counterparts, although a few of the faces look a little weird. The sound effects are really good - all the grunts and screams were recorded by the real wrestlers. Also, all of the entrance music is in the game, although you only get to hear a few seconds of it during the game\'s lackluster ring introduction sequence. You can, however, head to the biography section if you feel the need to hear any of the music in its entirety. The two-man announce team of Vince McMahon and Jim Ross is good, but it sometimes gets a little bit behind the action. Also, there are only a couple of different sayings for the signature moves, meaning that you\'ll be hearing Jim Ross shout ""Stone Cold Stunner! Stone Cold Stunner!"" quite a lot during the course of the game. <P>WWF War Zone is long on gameplay and has a lot of atmosphere. However, it really could have used a little more atmosphere. The ring introductions are extremely short, and the cutscenes in challenge mode (all of which feature a really bad-looking polygonal woman and a limousine) are just plain stupid. The grudge match challenge clips are decent, but their lack of specific taunts makes them seem a little flat. Still, this is best wrestling package ever released and shouldn\'t be missed by anyone with even a passing interest in wrestling. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Azure Dreams,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation']","{'Publisher:': 'Konami', 'ASIN:': 'B00000DMAP', '\n    Product Dimensions: \n    ': '8 x 4 x 10 inches', 'Shipping Weight:': '1.6 ounces ('}","['You are 15 years old. You are now of age to take on the role of ""monster tamer,"" a position your late father once held. In fact, your father was considered the greatest monster tamer in all the land. Your family name is legendary, and you have a lot to live up to. Your destiny is to enter the Demon Tower and retrieve the eggs of rare and exotic creatures, which you will then breed for companionship or to sell to the highest bidder. Such is the premise of Konami\'s newest RPG, Azure Dreams. <P>In the case of Konami, credit must be given where credit is due. Up until the time of the second generation of 32-bit games, RPGs had remained largely on the outskirts of most gamers\' tastes. It was a niche market defined by superdeformed characters, idiosyncratic Japanese overtones, and a sword and sorcery prerequisite that intimidated the average consumer. While 16-bit titles such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy III, and Super Mario RPG had been relatively successful, they were hardly selling as well as games like Mortal Kombat or Madden 93. So upon entering the 32-bit market, RPG fans had very little to choose from - Mystaria for the Saturn, Beyond the Beyond for the PlayStation, Shining Wisdom, and so on. So, while most people credit Final Fantasy VII for opening the floodgates for the impending wave of RPGs, it was really Suikoden that laid the groundwork. Despite its lackluster graphics, Suikoden\'s rich storyline and lengthy quest appealed not only to hard-core gamers, but to the novice role-player as well. It was so successful that Konami decided to translate its other 32-bit RPG, Vandal Hearts, almost immediately after Suikoden\'s release. Now, after the face of next-generation gaming has been permanently altered by games like Wild Arms, Persona, Dragon Force, Tactics Ogre, and Panzer Dragoon Saga, Konami has decided the time is right to release its most bizarre RPG to date. <P>Azure Dreams places you in the town of Monsbaia, where you assume the role of a youthful monster tamer, who, on the day of his 15th birthday, is eligible to enter the Demon Tower and search for monster eggs. The eggs that you collect may either be sold or hatched. If you choose to hatch them, you can then take these familiars into the tower with you to aid you on your journey. The higher in the tower you go, the more difficult it becomes to progress, but the eggs you will find will contain rarer and more exotic monsters. Monsters can later be fused into stronger creatures, which can be of great assistance later in the game. Unique to this sort of ""monster ranching"" is that the AI of each monster can be altered at any time during the game. For example, you can elect to have your monster travel behind you at all times, protecting you from attacks at the rear, or, you can choose to have the creature walk in front. You can also dictate whether it attacks enemies directly, remains on guard, or magically powers up your weapons with each attack. Unlike other turn-based RPGs, the fight sequences in Azure Dreams occur in real time, which gives the game a Zelda-esque feeling at times. As a result, the flexibility in the system is limited only by your own preferences, as the options are numerous. Another feature that keeps the game fresh is the random map generator, which creates completely new dungeon layouts each time you enter the Demon Tower. Your quest won\'t be short, however, since the Tower contains up to 90 different levels. <P>Once you attain a certain level of success from your monster-taming endeavors, you will be able to buy items that will enhance existing structures, while creating entirely new buildings as well. You\'ll be able to install a new theater, horse racing track, bowling alley, casino, and library, while improving your house, the hospital, and your monster hut, among others. You\'ll even be able to equip the interiors of practically any building with exercise machines, rugs, TVs, washing machines, etc. How you build up the town will go a long way towards influencing how much the residents like you. <P>During the game you will encounter a number of residents who will ask you to use your increasingly legendary prowess to help them with certain problems they might have. These miniquests add a large amount of variety to an already nonlinear game. With over 50 monsters to discover on over 90 different levels, Azure Dreams provides a considerable amount of replay value. <P>Graphically, the game is a bit rough. While characters are sprite-based, the backgrounds are fully polygonal and can be rotated 360 degrees. While the backgrounds look solid enough, the characters and monsters look really pixelated. Combined with a distracting method of providing transparent walls when traveling in the dungeons and a slightly awkward overhead view, Azure Dreams can be described as messy - colorful, but messy. Additionally, no one in the game has a shadow. Since this isn\'t an action/platformer, it doesn\'t cause any real problems, but it\'s a distracting detail nonetheless. The sound effects in Azure Dreams are functional, and while the soundtrack won\'t appeal to everyone, it manages to get the job done. <P>In all honesty, it\'s a surprise that Konami even brought Azure Dreams to the US. Its main character looks like a cross between Edward Scissorhands and Ronald McDonald and has a sarcastic attitude that\'s a far cry from most of today\'s cookie-cutter heroes. With each successive RPG, Konami has gotten bolder and braver. With an ever-increasing respect to the original Japanese source material, Konami has translated what could truly be termed a niche RPG. Straying from any conventional formula, Konami has created an RPG that\'s equal parts SimCity, Monster Rancher, and role-playing game. With a heartwarming story of discovery and companionship to boot, Konami has struck RPG gold again. Third time\'s a charm, apparently. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Through a series of subtle and artistic design decisions, Half-Life creates a reality that is self-contained, believable, and thoroughly engaging. And while it may be surprising that no game has utilized any of these ideas in the past, it's clear that any future shooter will be remiss to overlook them."", ""The plot of the game is typical (in fact, it's little more than an elaborate version of Doom). You are Gordon Freeman, scientist at the Black Mesa Research Facility, involved in some mysterious experiments. These experiments go awry, and foul creatures begin taking over the complex. It gets more complicated, but there's no need to ruin the surprises that await. Suffice it to say that Half-Life isn't a great game because of its story; it's a great game because of how it presents that story. From the opening moments of the game to the final showdown (and even beyond) all hell is continually breaking loose, and there is never a moment where you are not seeing things through Freeman's eyes. There are scripted events in the game. There are opening and closing scenes. But they all occur naturally within the game environment. It may sound simple, but it goes a long way toward helping create a believable world."", ""Weapon, ammunition, and health placement follows the same philosophy. You'll hardly ever come across an item that is just bobbing and spinning in place like some gift from the heavens. Valve has done a good job of justifying the typical health and armor meters. Freeman is wearing a hazard suit, used by researchers involved in dangerous experiments. To regain health and armor energy, you must fill up at power stations. These are almost always located in logical places, usually near areas where dangerous work would be performed. There are no power-ups to be found. Weapons and ammo are taken from supply closets or the corpses of fallen security guards and soldiers. Even the more experimental weapons have their proper place - in the weapons research department of the facility. And late in the game, once you've left the research facility, the supply of ammo and first aid kits is believably scarce."", ""There are no levels in Half-Life, or, more specifically, it lacks the concept of levels and episodes we've come to expect. The game is a continual stream of locations from beginning to end. You can move back and forth at will (with only a few exceptions), as can those who are pursuing you. And though the brief loading time between zones is the one artifact that breaks the flow of the game, the transitions are thankfully brief."", ""The attention to detail doesn't just stop with the basic structure. The game is full of surprises, continually throwing new obstacles and challenges in your path. There is a wide variety of textures, lending a distinct look to every area. The numerous scripted events bolster the illusion of reality, and you'll come across detailed scenes that are continually suspenseful. The gameplay is very puzzle-oriented, but the puzzles hardly seem to be superficial obstacles. Whether you're repairing a reactor or finding some way to dispose of a massive locked door, the puzzles always seem plausible in the world Valve has created."", ""The alien enemies are well designed and occasionally border on the terrifying. From the basic headcrab (which resembles a cross between Alien's facehugger and X-COM Apocalypse's brainsucker) to monstrosities a hundred times its size, the enemies truly look like organic beings. There are human enemies in the game, and these display a level of artificial intelligence that is remarkable. While many a game's idea of excellent AI is simply monsters that can make it through a doorway to follow you, Half-Life's antagonists act in a manner that is frighteningly realistic. They won't follow you through a doorway - they'll just lob a few grenades to where you're hiding and be done with it."", 'The weapons look and sound great, ranging from the realistic combat shotguns and grenade launchers, to the science-fictional, high-powered particle accelerators. The level design is diverse (owing a nod of thanks to Jedi Knight), including the expansive research facility, some great outdoor areas, and foreign locales that are best left to be discovered on your own. Suffice to say, it never gets repetitive.', 'The only problems with Half-Life are the results of it being so ambitious. The fact that all of the humans in the game look like clones takes from the otherwise realistic atmosphere. The diversity of the levels and puzzles will undoubtedly leave you thinking some areas were better than others. But complaints that arise are simply a reaction to the fact that the game is so close to ideal. Half-Life is an exceptional single-player game and a solid multiplayer game (though the upcoming Team Fortress add-on may make it even better). It takes the tried-and-true one step further but ends up leaps and bounds ahead of the rest. <i>--Ron Dulin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Castlevania 64,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['Cartridge only with minor wear.', ""Konami's long-running Castlevania series is renowned for its chilling atmosphere, fantastic music, and, most importantly, superb 2D gameplay. Now, for the first time in its illustrious 13-year career, the series is making the jump into 3D - a jump that understandably has many fans feeling quite skeptical. Fortunately, the development team at KCE Kobe has done an excellent job of making the transition to 3D, while still staying true to the series' roots. While not quite the overall epic masterpiece that was Symphony of the Night on the PlayStation, N64 Castlevania provides an oddly compelling 3D vampire-hunting experience that fans of the series should definitely not miss. <P>Castlevania lets you take the role of either Reinhardt Schneider, the latest whip-toting member of the Belmont clan (don't ask us why he's got a different last name), or Carrie Fernandez, a young girl with magical powers and a grudge. Both characters have their own separate (though similar) storylines, complete with entirely different endings and a couple of stages that are exclusive to each other's quests. Interestingly enough (to hard-core Castlevania fans, anyway), Carrie is a descendant of Sypha Belnades, the 15th century mage from Castlevania III. Unfortunately, Konami didn't bother to keep Carrie's and Sypha's last names consistent in the translation, thus ruining an otherwise interesting plot point of the game. <P>Unlike Symphony of the Night, with its RPG-like elements and free-roaming gameplay, N64 Castlevania plays more like the older games in the series (aside from the obvious fact that the gameworld is now 3D). The game progression is more linear, and each character has only two weapons they can use (a main weapon that can be powered up twice and a subweapon). The trademark special weapons are back (knife, ax, holy water, and cross), but as far as items go, there are only a few that you can collect during play, most of which are of the healing type. <P>While the game does feature a real-time clock function (similar to Zelda), it doesn't factor in to gameplay nearly as much as you'd hope. Only a couple of puzzles rely on the time of day, and they're hardly what you'd call inspired. There are a few other thought-provoking puzzles in the game (similar in style to the ones found in Resident Evil), but otherwise most of the emphasis has been placed on well-timed jumps and old-school platform-style gameplay. Some of these jumps can be rather frustrating if you're not careful with the controls, but it's nothing any old-school NES Castlevania fan won't be able to handle. <P>Each of the game's 12-plus stages is huge. A couple of the more confusing ones would've benefited from an in-game map (like the Forest of Silence and the Tunnel), but on the whole, the level designs are very nicely done. The graphics are nice and varied, with good use of textures and very little fogging (which seems to be used for atmosphere more than anything else). The lighting is real impressive, too. If there's one thing worth complaining about, it's the camera. All things considered, it's not that bad, but it does seem to get out of whack at the worst possible moments - especially in high-risk areas or during fast-paced battles. The game does offer three different camera styles, but the problems stem more from collision detection than the actual viewpoints. <P>Despite these minor gripes, Castlevania definitely excels. The developers have done a fantastic job of capturing the atmosphere and spirit of the series, while providing a well-balanced, challenging gameplay experience that's filled with pretty visuals, awesome (though limited) music, plenty of secrets, and some incredible bosses (just wait until you see Death... whew!). Let's just hope this doesn't mark the end of the 2D era of Castlevania games. -- John Morris <P><I>--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

In addition, you must come in first in each race to advance beyond the first three races. This is plenty difficult, and the muddy graphics don't help much.

Even though Crash was disarmingly cute and fuzzy, and even though the game's graphics were just about as good as they got in those days, the frustrating design of the game made playing it such a painful experience that I still have flashbacks when I see small marsupials on the Discovery Channel. But just one short year after his debut, Crash is back in a sequel that is so far superior to the original that I'm willing to forget the mistakes of the past. <P>The new storyline is simple: A very gullible Crash is corralled into collecting crystals for the evil Dr. Cortex and gems for the terrible N. Brio. There are 25 levels in all; each level contains an easy-to-find crystal and hard-to-earn gems. Instead of being forced to approach the game in a strictly linear fashion, you progress through a series of five warp rooms. Each warp room contains five levels, which you are free to tackle in any order. After you have found the crystals in each level, you can progress to the next warp room. This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system). <P>A lot of variety is packed inside this game. You'll navigate through simple run-and-jump areas, try to outrun a very mad polar bear, work your way through sewer systems, and even fly around with a jet pack. Within each level, the basic gameplay is similar to the original Crash: Running, jumping, and spinning are still the order of the day. Even though most levels are set in a semi-3D environment, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a platform game, plain and simple. The graphics are in a league of their own among PlayStation games, and the music couldn't be better. Unlike the original, Crash 2 is rarely frustrating enough to make you want to throw your controller at the TV. In fact, some expert gamers might find Crash to be a little on the easy side. <P>There are only two real problems with Crash Bandicoot 2. First, the semi-3D setup is sometimes hard to navigate, and you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly. Secondly, the game is just plain cheap at times; in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout. <P>In any event, these problems are balanced out by the game's excellent gameplay and intelligent design. Crash Bandicoot 2 is a topnotch platform game. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. -- John Broady <P><I>--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

The creators of SM64 knew that to be able to functionally jump from platform to platform, the default view would have to be directly above and behind the main character, and it is, or can be configured to be, about 95 percent of the time. In Croc however, the player is locked into a behind-and-to-the-side view during about half of the game's crucial moments, making jumps or even general movement far harder than they should be. In the beginning, this is far less of an issue and Croc shows off how much of an enjoyable title it could have been. But soon, moving platforms, dissolving platforms, and other such devices are added to the mix and the fun factor of the game falls off a cliff.

The goal is to wipe out all the other empires on Earth - you must contend with the likes of Genghis Khan, Catherine the Great, and Napoleon, among others - or be the first to colonize a planet successfully in far-off Alpha Centauri.  <P>As you might have gathered by now, playing Civilization II is a highly involved intellectual exercise that puts a premium on strategic thinking and long-term planning. It takes patience to learn the rules, although a tutorial mode helps quite a bit. The games themselves can last 30 hours or more. In other words, if you are in search of a quick adrenaline rush, you are advised to run, not walk, away from this game.  <P>However, if you\'re willing to invest the necessary time to learn and play Civilization II, you will be rewarded by some of the most intricate and involving gameplay available on the PlayStation. The level of control you have over your empire - everything from the political orientation to the tax rate to the names of cities, is under your command - lets you build a civilization that reflects your own personality. Be a violent dictator, a benevolent prince, or a noble republican. Forge alliances with other powers and then betray your allies when it suits you. Build a peaceful, economically oriented civilization and then convert your wealth into military might and crush your unsuspecting enemies. The bottom line is that just about whatever you dream up, you can do, and that is what makes Civilization II such a joy to play. <P>Not that this version isn\'t without some shortcomings. Even in its PC form, Civilization II was never much to look at, and things have gotten considerably rougher with this port. As the game progresses, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between units, and it\'s consistently hard to read the fuzzy text on the screen. While the control-pad interface is quite efficient, the lower resolution means that almost all the game\'s menus and information screens have been redesigned for the PlayStation, and many of them seem thrown together. (The world map is particularly horrible.) The sound is also dull by today\'s standards, and the background music gets monotonous as the hours go by. (Fortunately, you can turn it down.) And at ten blocks per saved game, you\'ll be stacking up the memory cards in no time, since you\'ll want to save every few turns. <P>For purists, I should also mention that there are a couple of fairly significant gameplay changes between this and the PC version. The first is that this version appears to use the combat engine from the original Civilization, rather than the more sophisticated engine introduced in the original version of Civilization II. This isn\'t that big of a deal - personally, I always thought the older engine was better - but it is somewhat curious. The other major change is that the PlayStation version doesn\'t include certain automation features (such as ""smart"" settlers that automatically improve your cities), which means you\'ll have to do a little more micromanagement than you might expect if you have had experience with the PC version. Finally, it seems that, level for level, the PlayStation version is somewhat easier than the PC version. (Either that, or I\'m a lot better at this game than I used to be!) <P>In the final analysis, Civilization II is just that - a game of analysis - and as such it\'s a welcome change of pace for the PlayStation. If the graphics were better, it would be a must-buy, but as it is, Civilization II is a solid, if not spectacular, game that strategy fans will not want to miss. --Vince Broady <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

As happens in Star Fox's predecessors, you fly along and blast away your enemies while powering up your weapons. But Star Fox 64 adds quality gameplay twists that rival the game's incredible 3D graphics. These features include multiple gameplay paths (which take you through various levels depending on how well you play, including a Tomorrow Land-like city, a meteor-filled corner of space, and a post-apocalyptic battleground), a submarine and a tank level, a four-player battle mode, and the smoothest 3D flight control yet seen on a console system. Not only is the animation incredibly smooth, but every polygonal building and ship is finely detailed. The enemies are also quite varied - in fact, the final boss, Andross, even qualifies as menacingly scary (there's something terrifying about a huge ape that literally chews you up and spits you out). This game is a pleasure to look at and does the Star Wars-like storyline justice with a truly cinematic quality."", ""At any given time you have a variety of enemies to blast, and the game alternates between on-rails levels (where you are constantly moving forward on a track with 3D movement), and slightly more open levels where you can explore a limited area.

Once you get the hang of it, the game becomes a fast-paced thrill ride through multiple levels of interplanetary warfare.

Mario Party,,['Mini Games'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['Mario Party [Japanese Import] for Nintendo 64', 'Mario Party is the first of several Mario games planned for this year that are being created by developers outside of Nintendo. In this case, the developer is Hudson, a company best known for the Bomberman series, while the others are HAL Systems, the creator of the Kirby line (which is handling the Mario fighting game, Smash Brothers), and Hot Shots Golf maker Camelot (which is doing Mario Golf). Each of the games\' focus plays to what the developers know best, in this case, Hudson\'s knowledge of good multiplayer game modes gleaned from producing countless incarnations of Bomberman, the seminal party-game series.  <P>How do they do that? By setting up Mario Party as a video game take on a traditional board game. One to four players compete against each other (and computer opponents if there are fewer than four humans present) for coins, stars, and bonus points. Instead of going the route of Monopoly\'s little dog and top hat assortment, Mario Party offers a handful of Mario characters for use as ""game pieces"" such as Mario, Yoshi, Wario, Peach, Donkey Kong, and Luigi. Each of the title\'s boards is based on the series as well (Donkey Kong has a jungle stage, Yoshi an island, and so on), and each differs in prominent ways. Once the characters and board are chosen, you vie for the order you\'ll proceed through the game by stopping a rotating number block, which reappears at the beginning of each turn to decide how many spaces you\'ll move. Plain spaces provide a number of coins, while specially marked spaces will draw you into bonus minigames (explained fully later) or introduce you to friendly or unfriendly nonplayer characters such as Toad, Shy Guy, and Boo. The one you least want to bump into is of course Bowser, who will either steal coins from you outright or engage you in forced minigames where you don\'t gain any coins if you win, and you lose coins if you lose. The main goal is to have the largest total number of stars at the end of a game, which can be bought along the way from Toad or by paying off a Boo to steal one from one of your opponents (this costs more than twice the regular 20-coin amount but is much more fun).  <P>The minigames are the Mario Party features that most take advantage of the title not being set on a flat plate of cardboard. You enter at the end of each round or by landing on marked spaces on the board. The games come in various shapes and sizes and in configurations of every player against the others, two vs. two, or three against one. Of the 50 in all, the most noteworthy examples are probably the Bobsled Run (which is reminiscent of the snow race in Super Mario 64, but with two characters sharing a sled), Face Lift (you try to drag around a mushed face a la Super Mario 64\'s intro), Mario Bandstand (a distant cousin of Parappa the Rapper), Lava Boardin\' (you race down a collapsing platform and jump over obstacles), and Cash Bash (one player is dressed up as Bowser, and the others hit him with hammers and steal his coins). Some are skill based, while many require button mashing or joystick twirling. The winner or winners gain coins, while the losers pay out or just leave with what they came into the game with - nothing more, nothing less. <P>Playing with a group of friends makes this game shine. There are enough random elements at work that enable huge upsets to happen about once every other round (which continues straight up to the end when bonus stars are given out that can nudge second- or third-place players to the forefront), and going after the lead player or teaming up against the computer is superfun - especially when you\'re trying to garner stars for the collective total (get enough and... things happen). On the negative side, some of the minigames aren\'t very fun to play in the multiplayer mode because of control or perspective problems, or because they\'re just plain boring - but that\'s to be expected with the sheer number of games. Meanwhile, the games that are enjoyable to play in multiplayer are nowhere near as good in the single-player mode. Really, it\'s that multiplayer competitive spark of screaming at and/or cheering for your friends that injects life into these often-simple little games, and without it, they\'re just simple little games. The single-player mode seems thrown in the way multiplayer modes seem thrown in most other games. Mario Party is intended to be played with a group of friends, and for those people who can really take advantage of that, this game is a must-buy. The less-social gamer might want to rent. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Body Harvest,,['1 Player'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['Cartridge and hard plastic collector case with reprint of original case artwork - NO MANUAL - Front label is fully in tact. Game cartridge is in good condition but may show normal signs of age such as minor scratches, discoloration, or debris in creases. All games are tested before being put into our inventory.', ""Playing DMA Design's Body Harvest is like taking the lead role in a BBC sci-fi TV series. The visuals may not be revolutionary, and the story may be a bit cheesy, but there's something unmistakably charming about the whole thing. <P>Anyway, analogy aside, you're a super-soldier who's traveled back in time to put down the initial invading forces of an alien race that's ravaged your era's earth. This plays out into a game that's not easy to describe, save for the fact that it has a few graphical and gameplay similarities to Rare's Blast Corps. You move about a variety of terrain piloting your little soldier man or sitting behind the controls of cars, tanks, planes, boats, and the like. Crucial points of gameplay are reached when a harvesting force of aliens takes on a nearby town. You then have to locate and destroy them before they gobble up six humans, which would produce a nigh-invulnerable mutant alien (that's a very bad thing). Encounters with smaller forces are frequent and pepper the parts of the game where you have to solve minor puzzles in order to move along. <P>From within the gameplay, Body Harvest is not much like anything else, actually. It's a slower-paced title, but not to the point of being boring. Its originality is refreshing (being able to flip from walking to manning a tank to flying a plane is pretty nice). The graphics are pretty bland at times, as one might expect from a much-delayed first-generation N64 game, and the lack of a look function dates it, but neither of these elements really gets in the way. The soundtrack, while limited and too often repeated, is atmospheric in an X-Files theme song sort of way. <P>Where some elements of the game teeter on the edge of slightly above average, pushing well above the median there's a good chunk of value to Body Harvest, as each stage is pretty big and requires a lot of work to beat. On the downside of that upside, the game only allows you to save once a major task is accomplished. This means that you may have played a certain section for an hour, made a wrong turn, ended up in a lake, drowned, and had to restart the stage. Or it might so happen that you play for an hour, get thrashed by a boss character, and have to start over again. And so on. Consider yourself warned: This sort of scenario can happen frequently (a happenstance that robbed the score of at least a point for the reviewer's tilt). <P>For gamers looking for something almost completely unique or even just a big, dumb game to fill the void before Zelda comes out, Body Harvest fits the bill nicely.  --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

It's probably the only racing game that awards points for smashing into the opposition, even though the more your car makes contact with others, the more likely it is to blow up, thus ending the game. Perhaps because of this irony Destruction Derby, now in its second installment, continues to be one of the Playstation's most exciting racing titles. <P>The basics of Destruction Derby 2 are almost identical to the original. You will still find three modes of play (Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing, and Destruction Derby), three cars to choose from, and a host of different tracks (seven raceways, four Destruction Derby enclosed arenas). What's new in DD2 is the size and speed of the courses. The winding, narrow, claustrophobic roadways of the first Destruction Derby have been replaced with huge, wide superspeedways worthy of games like NASCAR Racing and The Need for Speed. Each track offers its own set of characteristics and physics, with whipping turns, monstrous jumps, and high banks. All are infinitely superior to the tight, slow courses of the original. <P>But don't think for a minute that the game is easy just because the tracks are more conducive to high-speed racing. The sense of speed in DD2 is terrific, though not quite the 250 mph the speedometer claims. Regardless of which car you select, the asphalt in DD2 seems to be covered with glare ice - which means your car will be slippin' and slidin' from the get-go, rocketing the unwary straight to the back of the field. But keeping your car on the track is only half the battle. <P>This wouldn't be Destruction Derby without spectacular vehicular calamities galore - accidents that by far outclass those found in the first version of this game. Cars flip, roll, smoke, and splinter into metallic shards, leaving dangerous bits of shrapnel that in turn lead to some of the best multicar wrecks in gaming. Pit stops have been added for damage repair. Like the original, DD2 boasts some fabulous, photorealistic graphics for a spectacular view (though you'd be a fool to take your eyes off the road!). On the downside, the number of camera views has been reduced to two: in-car and low chase. A high chase view is sadly missing. <P>All things considered, Destruction Derby 2 would be more fun if it were a bit easier to play.

Myst - PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""One of the best-selling computer games of all time, Myst caused quite a sensation when it was released in September, 1993. Several years later, it remains on best-seller lists and continues to generate lookalike games hoping to cash in on its widespread appeal. What's most confounding about Myst is its longevity. While an interesting game, it hardly warrants the fanaticism surrounding it - and this Playstation port does little to explain the phenomenon. <P>The premise is simple. The player must explore the island of Myst, researching the notes of a mysterious man named Atrus and his exploration of several distinct worlds. Through Atrus' notes, players find solutions to puzzles that open gateways to these worlds, which they then explore to unravel the mystery surrounding the disappearance of Atrus and his two sons, Sirrus and Achenar. The majority of the game is simply walking around the various locales, making connections between the cryptic information given and the puzzles presented. In this sense, Myst demands a great deal from the player - careful attention must be paid to the slightest details and copious notes must be taken at all times. <P>The wandering itself is not an unpleasant task - the much touted graphics really are spectacular (though the level of detail is not quite as rich in the Playstation version), even after three years and several dozen knock-offs. Even more incredible is the audio, with a great musical score and moody ambient sounds. But the joy of exploration eventually wears off, even after discovering a new world, and the stagnant nature of the game transforms this adventure into more of a relaxing slideshow than an engrossing adventure. <P>But three million Myst fans can't be all wrong. The game does hold some engaging puzzles, and the story unfolds just gradually enough to maintain your interest. On the downside, though, is the fact that Myst may have the single worst payoff in the history of games. But if you're patient, and enjoy a good puzzle now and again, the long and occasionally frustrating journey to the end may be worth the disappointing arrival. --Ron Dulin <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Arriving surprisingly fast after the debut of the original game, Snowboard Kids 2 brings back the same style of simple snowboarding action with a whole host of options to make your gaming experience as complete as can be. For anyone new to Atlus\' funky little racing game, Snowboard Kids 2 offers a touch of Cool Boarders, with a dash of Wipeout thrown in for good measure. You pick one character out of a posse of ten-year-olds. The characters range from the ""naughty"" Slash Kamei, to the mega-genius Wendy Lane. The characters have different attributes, which give them distinct advantages, depending on which course you\'re playing: speed, shooting, or tricks. Adding to the flexibility of the game are the different boards, which cover speed, balance, and tricks.', ""Gameplay consists of the usual zooming-down-the-course action, with a few twists to keep the action fresh. Among the variety of slopes and courses available (Sunny Mountain, Turtle Island, Jingle Town, Wendy's House, Linda's Castle, and Crazy Jungle) are numerous obstacles and varying course elements, like waterfalls and steep cliff drops. If those weren't enough, there are also offensive and defensive weapons available (hence, the Wipeout comparison). There are a bunch of great weapons that can quickly change the outcome of the game. The slap stick, for example, will smack your opponents to the ground and take some of their money while it's at it. The parachute attack will lift your targets high into the air and drop them slowly to the ground, giving you plenty of time to overtake them. Other weapons, like the snowman, whirlwind, freeze shot, and super ghost can also cause much consternation for your opponents. Of course, to counter players who may be drawing a bead on you are items like the speed fan, rocket booster, rock, and rat face. Each of these has different effects that can save your place in the race, if need be. While the steering and feel of the game could be a little smoother, once you get used to the semi-wooden controls, things go much easier."", ""After you select story or action mode, you will eventually run into a couple of boss encounters that will test just how much you've learned in the preceding races. You will run into a snowman-robot stage and a dinosaur stage that will test just how good your snowboarding skills are. During each race, you'll head into Snow Town where you can do a little shopping and board customizing. As you earn more money, the quality of board you can buy will improve as well. You can also go into the paint shop and select a new paint job for your snowboard. Other places you can go include Wendy's Internet cafe, where you'll get secret information on courses and other factors in the game. You can also change your character at the school, save at the phone booth, and play a number of different games at the penguin house, clock tower, and Snowboard Times office. Simply put, there's plenty to do in Snowboard Kids 2, and it'll take you a while to unlock all the game's secrets."", ""While it plays a little stiffly, the game still looks nice, with colorful graphics, very little polygon draw-in, and upbeat musical tracks. Peppered with lots of cute little cutscenes, Snowboard Kids 2 offers plenty of replay value and is one of the best racing games out there for a younger audience. Yes, a younger audience. Aimed squarely at the young 'uns, Snowboard Kids 2 is probably one of the best games you could get for a younger gamer. Older vets might find the game tedious, although it would take a real cynic to deny the effort involved in making this game. With the four-player mode offering decent multiplayer options, albeit at a much slower framerate, SK2 might be the best party-racing alternative to Mario Kart 64. Much less contrived than Diddy Kong Racing, Snowboard Kids 2 comes highly recommended for the younger crowd.

He\'s a secret agent who lives in his own high-tech spycave, but the only kind of case he ever seems to get entails collecting remote controls and entering television sets that transport him to strange new worlds. (Names like Invasion of the Body Slammers and Lake Flaccid speak for themselves.) In his latest adventure, he must rescue fellow agent X-Tra (Baywatch\'s Marliece Andrada, whose presence here screams, ""You\'re being marketed to, little boy."") from his long-standing enemy, Rez. In typical third-season fashion, the makers of a hit series aren\'t straying too far from formula, and you can tell that, like Gary Coleman in Diff\'rent Strokes, Gex is having a tough time showing off his range. <P>As mentioned before, Gex enters differently themed worlds where he must accomplish a number of tasks before receiving a remote-control prize (there are four per stage). The more controllers he gets, the more worlds he can enter. Gex gets around by running, jumping, bouncing on his tail, climbing grooved walls with his sticky gecko feet, and leaping with a karate kick. That kick can also be used against enemies, as can the tail bounce, tail swipe, and his spit after he swallows special power-ups.  <P>Probably the signature feature of the Gex series is that comedian Dana Gould spits TV- and movie-related one-liners throughout. While the jokes were an inventive feature in the first Gex game, they\'ve since gotten really tired. The writers behind Dana Gould\'s quips simply seem as though they\'ve run out of ideas. The comments are a lot less Austin Powers-obsessed than they were in Enter the Gecko, but you\'ll still be thankful for the option to turn them down or off. <P>The game engine behind Gex 3 is indubitably the little engine that could. It\'s responsible for Gex: Enter the Gecko, Akuji the Heartless, this game, and the upcoming Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, too. Each game has seen its own modifications; this one obviously has the most in common with the last Gex game, the main difference being the improved game camera. Graphically, it looks much the same as before, maybe with a little less pop-up and slowdown, though both are still present. You now have more control over modifying your perspective, and the intelligent camera is better, but the views are still nowhere as tight as in Insomniac\'s Spyro the Dragon or Rare\'s Banjo-Kazooie. Specifically, it can still be terribly difficult to judge distance and depth from your viewpoint, sometimes making 3D-platform jumps a grueling proposition. This doesn\'t come up a great deal of the time, since there\'s a surprisingly small amount of platform jumping in this platform game, but when it appears, it can be a real teeth gnasher. The developers seem to have realized this because once you get further into levels like Little Red Riding in the Hood and Cut Cheese Island, shortcuts appear. So, if you miss a jump, you won\'t lose too much ground. But the final stage, where you hop from satellite to rotating satellite on your way to battle Rez, is a perspective nightmare, with dark textures on top of a dark background.  <P>Visual gripes aside, the game is more fun than its predecessor. Gex\'s new outfits often provide him with new abilities. For instance, when he\'s wearing a vampire\'s cape or Little Red Riding Hood\'s hood, he can glide. When he has a pirate\'s hook, he can use it to slide down ropes. There are also minigames that place him in a kangaroo\'s pouch or in a tank. These elements may sound lame on paper, but they do break things up nicely. This, along with the improved level design, make the game addictive enough that you\'ll want to play it through, and maybe even go back and discover everything there is to find within.  <P>Gex 3 is enough of an improvement over the last game that fans of the previous one should enjoy it even more, but with the leaps we\'ve seen in 3D PlayStation platformers over the last year (read: Spyro the Dragon), it comes off feeling a bit dated. It\'s essentially a fun game, but one that ends up taking up residence in the badlands between a rent and a buy recommendation. So, in short, Gex has become a little more refined, but less original at the same time. --Steven Garrett <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Over a dozen hi-tech weapons including shotguns machine guns rocket launchers and grenades help Duke deal with those bad aliens. There is even 2 player split-screen action featuring Dukematch co-op team-play and all-new Meltdown modes.', 'Considering the fact that 3D Realms released the shareware version of Duke Nukem 3D in early \'96, this PlayStation version feels like a blast from the past. Still, when it comes to the would-be king of first-person shooters, you can bet that people will be ready to ""come get some,"" no matter what time or which platform. <P>Everyone who watches the evening news knows that sex and violence sells. Hence, The 17+ warning and lurid screenshots on the Duke Nukem jewel case become an alluring advertisement for what\'s inside. The little black CD fits all three ""episodes"" from the original game and throws in a final episode to keep things interesting. Playing through the game, Duke visits a host of cheesy locales, including strip bars and skin-flick theatres, eventually finding himself aboard a giant space station. Each soda machine, movie poster, magazine rack, and barroom is luxuriously appointed with beautiful textures, making environments fresh each time you round a corner. Of course, beauty isn\'t necessarily a protective quality, as you\'ll quickly find that most objects can be obliterated with a couple of properly aimed gun blasts. <P>Weapons exhibit an ingenuity that surpasses the Doom model of simply raising the caliber with each new gun. For example, Duke can lob a pipe bomb and wait to detonate it when an unsuspecting creature approaches, or he can reduce befuddled foes to a squashable size with a shrinker gun. There are also original items that can be picked up, such as the jetpack, which gives Duke the power to fly around freely until his jets have cooled. When the novelty of these implements of destruction begins to get old, however, the game as a whole begins to cool down.  <P>First of all, the monsters appear markedly dated. LAPD piggies, flying brains, and spastic, machine gun-wielding aliens are among the humorous nasties you\'ll meet, but their sprite-based 2D rendering makes the action a little flat. When you combine this with the fact that the animations of fiery explosions and pulpifying creatures seem to be sorely lacking in frames (as compared with the PC version), you may question why Duke ever decided to make another platform jump. <P>What\'s more, only three set control configurations are offered. Control style can vary greatly from player to player, especially in first-person shooters. Given this, most people may never get their coordination entirely up to speed in Duke Nukem before another, more option-rich shooter comes along for the PlayStation.  <P>If you want to duke it out deathmatch-style in Total Meltdown, you\'re out of luck unless you have two PlayStations. Why 3D Realms didn\'t allow for players to have a slug fest on one machine, or even include AI ""bots"" to use as target practice (as it did with the N64 version), remains a mystery. <P>Duke Nukem remains a classic game for the PC. Running on a PlayStation, the game suffers from sketchy graphics and limited control. If nothing else, this PlayStation version will give non-PC owners a chance to sample 3D Realms\' ridiculous world of blood and lace.  --Tim Soete <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"[""Bursting with stunning realism and high excitement baseball action Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest drives home the winning run! Improved player animations and color commentary by Dave Niehaus-'The Voice of the Mariners'-make you feel like you're really at the game while easy-to-use controls updated rosters & statistics and an optional fantasy draft make it even more fun than being there!"", ""Fans of last year's Griffey game are sure to be pleased with what Nintendo and Angel Studios have come up with for Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest - the game is a visually beefed-up version of last year's title, with a few little fixes and enhancements. Arcade-baseball game fans are sure to love it, although fans who prefer a more balanced simulation-style game should look elsewhere. <P>The overall presentation, control scheme, and basic feel of the game all center around ease of play. With three levels of difficulty and four different modes to play, there's more than enough to keep you busy for awhile. In addition, this year's game features a create-a-player mode that lets you build 20 different players. <P>The control scheme is set up, for the most part, just like last year's game. The default batting system features the target cursor, which you must place over a small box that indicates where the pitch is headed. In addition, there is classic, a second batting option, which takes away the batting cursor and lets you simply time the pitch. These two different styles of batting are great in games where players of different skill levels play against the computer, although it would be nice if the game allowed each player in a two-player game to select the style he preferred.  <P>When fielding, you can throw the ball one of two ways - by pushing the analog stick in the direction of the base and hitting the A button, or by simply pushing one of the four C buttons that represents the corresponding base. The latter is the more effective of the two since your player will sometimes take a few extra steps in the direction he's throwing the ball when you use the analog-stick method. Fielding a ball from the outfield is extremely easy, thanks to the guide arrows that always point toward the ball. Even when the ball rockets past your outfielder, and he's no longer on the screen, all you have to do is push in the direction of the guide arrows and he'll find his way right to the ball. Overall, the control in Griffey is easy and intuitive, both when you're in the field or up to bat, but it isn't perfect. When you're hustling to make a play, it seems to take too long for your fielder to throw the ball. This is due to the lengthy animation that turns him to face the right direction before he throws. While it looks nice, the animation could still have looked as good and fit the rest of the game's pace better if it just took less time to complete.   <P>Graphically, Slugfest is quite a step up from last years Griffey. It's no All-Star Baseball 2000, but the game does have that extremely sharp hi-res look to it, especially when you're using an expansion pak. The player models this year aren't nearly as boxy. Instead, they've got an extremely smooth look. The animation of the players is varied and well-done. <P>In the audio department, Slugfest is good, as far as baseball games go. It features play-by-play calls by Mariners announcer Dave Niehaus, as well as an umpire that at times sounds a little strange, a standard PA guy, and Ken Griffey himself making some color-commentary calls every once in a while. The sound effects are fair, except for one annoying sound, which occurs when you are throwing a special pitch - it sounds like an impression of a slide whistle. All this audio is presented in Dolby Surround, so those of you who have a good sound system will be able to take advantage of it. <P>In the end, Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest, as the name implies, is a fast-paced arcade-style baseball game that will appeal to anyone who wants an intuitive, easy-to-play game. It's especially good for younger players who might not want to deal with some of the complex batting and pitching schemes of other N64 games. Fans who enjoy a sim-style baseball game should probably just stick to the option-laden All-Star Baseball 2000. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete,,['MISSING DISC THREE AND FOUR'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The standard 2 Disc Game Version by Working Designs, not the complete Box Set. Return to the world of LUNAR, in the completely reworked 32-bit version of the RPG classic. Journey back to a place where dragons yet live, and magic is valued above all else. Join Alex, the young adventurer, as he begins a quest with his friends to save their land from the crushing advance of the Magic Emperor. Explore dungeons, fight terrifying monsters, and gather information from the locals as you advance toward the explosive confrontation with the Magic Emperor himself! Exciting, menu-driven combat will keep you challenged until the last.', ""After a seemingly inexhaustible series of delays, Working Designs has finally redelivered the game that put them on the map. Originally released in Japan more than two years ago on the Sega Saturn, Lunar Complete is extremely dated but still delivers where it's important - gameplay. <P>Alex was but a boy in the isolated village of Burg, a boy who dreamed of one day being like his lifelong hero, Dragonmaster Dyne. As the typical RPG would have it, Alex's dream comes true as he's swept into an adventure to save the world from a great evil, save his woman, and enter manhood. While Lunar Complete retains the overall story and theme of the Sega CD original, a number of the game's individual events are different. For example, a number of the trivial problems facing Alex on the road to adventure, such as the broken bridge and lighthouse, have been eliminated completely, while the entire ending of the game has been reworked. Additionally, GameArts chose to add three new female accomplices to the ranks of evil. Fortunately, all these changes are for the better - the end result is an adventure that's more epic, satisfying, and generally cooler than the original while retaining the emphasis on character development that earned Lunar its lofty reputation in the first place. <P>Like the story, Lunar's gameplay has been tweaked and refined, but largely remains the same. Lunar is a traditional, old-school RPG in every way, even though it is one of exceptional quality. The excellent battle engine from the original is still in place. Unlike most RPGs, Lunar's battle system takes character movement into account, letting you position your characters and set up more elaborate attacks. Once characters earn multiple attacks through level advancement, this becomes especially useful. You will no longer encounter enemies in the overworld, however, and you can see approaching monsters in the dungeons. While the move to remove monsters from the overworld altogether is somewhat questionable, the ability to see monsters in the dungeons is a blessing, letting you run from or prepare for battles before they begin. On a more unfortunate note, Alex can no longer command magic and relies on virtually the same sword techniques that Lunar 2's Hiro does, ultimately hurting some of the game's strategic elements. As a result, boss battles generally boil down to Alex repeatedly using his Sword Dance until the battle's done, while the other characters support him with healing and attack magic. A minor flaw, and an unnecessary change, nonetheless. <P>As stated before, Lunar is a truly dated game - with the exceptions of the voice and FMV, the game portions of Lunar could be faithfully re-created on a Super Nintendo. However, the game's colorful graphics and visual design are still attractive, even seen through such a low-tech window - not a single polygon can be found on Lunar's dual CDs. The 2D simplicity of Lunar's world is greatly enhanced through the use of exquisitely produced anime cutscenes, used for everything from simple character introductions to brilliant destruction. Unfortunately, GameArts took away one of the Sega CD's coolest features, the lack of the RPG staple color-swapped enemies. Never in the Sega CD original did one see the same enemy, only sporting a different color scheme. Lunar: Complete not only brings pallette-swapping back in full force but mostly contains monsters from Lunar 2's bestiary. Lunar's sound is quite good, but much of the game's new music, such as the battle theme, doesn't compare with the original's. <P>Working Designs has had plenty of time to work on Lunar's translation, and fortunately it shows. The text is for the most part excellent and doesn't rely too heavily on Working Designs' traditionally puerile humor. The voices are also of excellent quality, truly bringing the characters to life in both the 2D world and the cutscenes. Working Designs' extras are nice touches, although the Making of Lunar video is ridiculously overwrought with tales of the game's translation instead of its creation. <P>So, it's finally here. Lunar: Complete is a must-buy for fans of the series, as well as an excellent introduction to this landmark RPG series. Lunar may not have modern aesthetics, but its gameplay and story are among the best of any RPG of any era. --Peter Bartholow <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Heck, back in the old days, he used to kick the bucket about every other issue.

Also populating this realm are the villains Braniac, Darkseid, Bizarro, Metallo, several other bad folks from the animated series, and an endless array of shadowy drone characters. Sure, it\'s pretty slim on premise, but that in and of itself isn\'t a bad thing. Many titles have provided quality gameplay with only a paper-thin story supporting them. Superman, however, isn\'t one of them, and the game that follows is one of the weakest ever, even in the dubious category known as ""licensed games.""', 'The gameplay alternates between standard 3D adventure fare and timed mission objectives. The 3D adventure elements include collecting keys to open doors, beating up enemies, and pushing buttons in the proper order shortly after receiving instructions as to which order to push them. Meanwhile, the mission objectives require you to fly though hoops that Lex Luthor has inexplicably left suspended in the air, save innocents from harm, and toss objects about. Except for flying, to use your super powers you must acquire power-ups, such as heat vision, super breath, and super speed - all of which run out eventually.', ""Still, nothing sounds too offensive yet, right? It's the execution of all these elements that absolutely kills the game. The controls are so unresponsive that you'll assume you've pushed the wrong button and begin bashing on all of them for some sort of attention, and the perspective routinely manages to vex you. Now, add in all those simplistic goals mentioned earlier to this mix, and you've got an incredibly tedious experience in front of you. And it's one that resides in an environment so sparse it makes a Zen garden look crowded. This environment has suspect collision detection and obvious bugs that vie for your attention, and painted-in graphics that appear subpar even for a first generation N64 game."", ""But there's more. The multiplayer modes - a deathmatch and a race, where one player sets up the floating rings and the others attempt to push past him - feel very reminiscent of Ubi Soft's Buck Bumble, meaning they seem thrown in at the last minute and unfinished. The soundtrack would be considered bad for the SNES, and it loops constantly, while the sparse voice work even changes at one point, from Man of Steel actors to someone who sounds nothing like the lead of the show."", ""The only Superman compliment I can find to say is that flying beats walking. If I've been in any way unclear up to this point, let me state it simply: This is easily the worst game I've ever played.

Each class plays a little differently, with the warrior being stronger, faster, and lacking in magical attacks; the mage is weaker, though he has far-ranging magical attacks that allow him to keep his distance from enemies; and the cleric is a mix of the two. Artifacts have different effects for different characters as well. For example, the flechette item acts like a grenade for a warrior, a bomb for a mage, and, best yet, a poison gas cloud for the cleric, which can be used to take out multiple enemies if placed correctly. <P>Other than its characters, Hexen also differs from traditional Doom play by its ""hubs,"" or levels that must be come back to after puzzles are solved or items acquired. Both are pretty standard fare for players who have taken on other versions of the game (it is, granted, a fairly straight port), but if Hexen on the Nintendo 64 is the first time you\'ve tried the title, you\'ll likely find it a nice break from the monotonous ""run and shoot"" first-person games because of its puzzle aspects and more strategic take on fighting. And Hexen carries a play element that Midway\'s Doom 64 really should have had, the deathmatch. In it, you can take on your friends in two- to four-player matches. The four-player quarter screen match isn\'t really worth mentioning, but the two-player split-screen mode is worth your time. <P>Unfortunately, there are several technical factors that make Hexen a sub-par product when compared to Doom 64. The graphics, while better than ever before, are occasionally plagued by frame rate problems. Likewise, the sound is fairly moody and well done, but during save times, it freaks out and gets quite choppy. But most important of all is the title\'s fatal bug: During the platform jumping sections of the game, if you save on a platform before attempting a jump (which most players do), and then proceed to fall (this is bound to happen at least once), when you load your saved game back up, the cart places you in the middle of the fall instead of on the platform before you jump. Since only one save is allowed per memory pack, you can kiss any progress you\'ve made so far goodbye, making it impossible to play through. For me, this happened when I was about two hours into one game, and then four into another. Frustrating? Yup. <P>While Hexen on the N64 does have its plusses, I\'m afraid I can\'t recommend the title with this horrible save game bug in place. Many people were surprised when the game hit store shelves on time, but it looks like it wasn\'t really ready to go. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Command &amp; Conquer,,"['Number of Players Supported: 1 Player', 'Miscellaneous Attributes: Battery Backed RAM, Expansion Pak, Rumble Pak']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['The quintessential PC real-time strategy game <i>Command & Conquer</i>  has been re-created specifically for the N64 with new 3-D graphics and exclusive  missions not available anywhere else. Westwood Studios fully redesigned the game  for Nintendo 64 with new 3-D units, buildings, and terrain. Play as either the  lawful Global Defense Initiative determined to uphold freedom, or the evil  Brotherhood of Nod bent on total world domination. Construct bases, command  armies, and develop new technologies in a battle to control the earth.', 'Both the Global Defense Initiative and the Brotherhood of Nod have their own  characteristics and style of play. Each side has its own set of buildings,  units, and tactics of war. The GDI specializes in building barracks to house  infantry, while the Brotherhood of Nod is a structure that trains elite shock  troops. Throughout the game, players must seek out and mine the precious mineral  known as tiberium, which provides both sides with the power they need to keep  their forces operational.', 'There are a variety of mission types in <i>Command & Conquer</i>. Some require  an all-out assault on the opposition, while other missions demand careful  planning and strategy as only a single unit is available. Players must also deal  with changing terrain and the ever present ""fog of war,"" which prevents them  from viewing portions of the battlefield they have not yet explored. Support for  the N64 Expansion Pak allows for enhanced graphics.', '', ""Real-time strategy has been a staple of PC gaming for years. Several of the PC's most popular RTS games have made their way to various console systems, but all of them suffer from the same basic flaws: lower resolution and shoddy control. Command & Conquer for the N64 almost manages to get around both of these problems, and while the resulting game is good, there are still a few little clunky things that get in the player's way. The game's storyline, told through your mission briefings, is reasonably deep and pretty entertaining. While the full-motion video briefings of the other versions have been scrapped in favor of a slideshow of pertinent images, the audio is intact. So, depending on which faction you choose, you'll hear things from either a GDI (read: GI Joe-like good guys) or a Brotherhood of NOD (read: Cobra-esque bad guys) perspective. Each faction has its own worldview, its own various structures, and its own set of troops. Each faction does have different-looking vehicles and buildings, but do just about the same thing for their side. There are definitely differences, but the game is pretty balanced, so there really isn't any one super weapon on either force. Like just about every other RTS game in the world, this game is a tale of resource management. To build more structures and train enough troops to roll over your enemies, you must maintain a positive cash flow. You earn money by harvesting Tiberium - a mineral that rises to the planet's surface, forming dangerously toxic fields full of cash. Harvest enough of it, and you can build everything from basic machine-gun troopers to complex flying machines, flame tanks, and death-dealing obelisks. Come up short, and you can sell some buildings for quick influxes of cash, but this is usually a last-ditch tactic. Just make sure nothing happens to your harvester, and don't attack until you've got enough military might to crush your enemy two or three times, and you should be just fine. Those of you who have seen the other console versions of Command & Conquer are probably expecting this version to look the same as the other versions, complete with flat, blocky 2D sprites that are run in a resolution far too low to be discernable. But the terrain, buildings, and vehicles in the N64 version of C&C are done entirely in 3D, giving an all-new look to the game. This, combined with the expansion pack, lets you run in a higher resolution, which makes figuring out if you're looking at a minigunner or a grenadier a bit easier. If you still can't tell what you're looking at, the camera is slightly controllable, allowing you to zoom in or out a little bit. It would have been nice if the game ran at a resolution that would let you keep the map and building screen open at all times, since constant monitoring of your radar map is a key tactic in the game. Without the expansion pack, you're limited to the standard medium resolution. It looks nice, but it's a bit too blocky for my tastes. The game's speed and frame rate vary slightly throughout the game, depending on how much action you've got on the screen. At the beginning of a level, when you don't really have anything uncovered, scrolling is incredibly speedy, almost to the point of being too fast. When you get into major confrontations with the enemy, and structures are blowing up left and right, the frame rate sinks quite a bit, and the game's control suffers as the frame rate gets choppier. Aside from the frame rate problem, the game's control is well thought out and is definitely the best implementation of RTS-style control on a console controller to date. The C buttons are used to assign and recall various teams. So you can assign your attack force to the top C button, your engineers to left C, and so on. The analog stick lends itself well to controlling your pointer, though it's not quite as precise as a mouse on any of the control speed settings, so you'll occasionally miss moving targets until you've gotten used to the touchy feel of the cursor. The game features plenty of unit speech, and the music from the original version of the game has made it to the N64, though it doesn't sound quite as good. Keeping the audio from the PC version's briefings was a great idea, as text and still images wouldn't really convey the urgency of the game's various missions. Both campaigns from the original game are in this one, and there is a collection of pretty tough special ops missions that can be played separately from the main game. You can save your game at any time, though there are only two save game slots, so if you're the type of person that likes to save 20 different times to try different tactics, you'll be out of luck. The game doesn't feature any kind of multiplayer element, but considering that the only viable option would be a split-screen mode that would ruin any kind of surprise attack that you or your friends may plan, it's probably for the best that no time was wasted on a multiplayer mode. The single-player game is definitely strong enough to keep you interested, at least through both sides of the main campaign, though only hard-core players will remain onboard for the tough special ops missions. If you can handle clicking and dragging with the analog stick and the A button instead of a mouse, Command & Conquer is an improvement over the original game. The graphics give the game a surprisingly fresh look, and the excellent control scheme keeps the game from becoming as frustrating as the PlayStation and Saturn versions of C&C.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

But first you must defeat the 8 other warriors and your own clone. Only then can you face Thadurca. Some are fighting for revenge. Some for peace. Some for power. But right now... let the battle begin.', ""Originally released in Japan a few months ago as the tongue-twistingly titled Eretzvaju, Titus has picked up the projectile-based fighter and released it in the States as the hilariously named Evil Zone. An amalgamation of Psychic Force and Destrega, Evil Zone is a projectile-based 3D fighter that adds a dynamic element lacking from most of today's fighting games. Developed by Yuke's, the team behind the successful (in Japan at least) Toukon Retsuden series, and the not so successful Soukaigi (Square's recent action RPG), Evil Zone is a refreshing surprise from a development team not known for fighting games."", 'The premise in Evil Zone centers around the main character, Danvaizer, a superhero in the mold of classic Japanese afternoon TV shows (a la Power Rangers, Kamen Rider, etc.). While the storyline is truly superfluous, it nevertheless suffices as reason enough to gather Danvaizer and nine other combatants together to do battle in a distinctly different manner than most other fighting games.', ""Like Psychic Force, the majority of the action takes place via long-range attacks. Streamlining things considerably is the fact that there are only two action buttons at work: attack and block. While this may seem unfeasibly simple, the control scheme fits the game just fine. The attack button, when pressed once, twice, or three times, at a distance, will fire a basic projectile attack. When pressed within striking distance, your character will automatically use his close-quarters attack. The subtleties of the battle engine only reveal themselves at a distance, however, as the best and most powerful attacks are almost all long-range. By pressing the attack button in conjunction with the D-pad (up, down, left, or right), each character will perform different moves. Depending on how long you hold the attack button down, this will also affect the nature of the attack. For example, by pressing up and attack at the same time, one character might unleash an energy discuss. If you press up and the attack button rapidly two or three times, that same attack would now come out in two or three smaller, faster bursts. Also, each character has a stun attack (either forward and attack, or backwards and attack) that you can dizzy your opponent with, setting him up for a smash attack (forward, forward, attack), a projectile attack, or, better yet, a captured attack (down and attack). Captured attacks are particularly cool because each character has at least three different moves, depending on his proximity to the enemy (midrange, long distance, or behind). Should you snare your opponent with a captured attack, you'll be treated to some of the most visually spectacular moves yet seen in a fighting game. Take Danvaizer, for instance. One of his captured attacks holds his quarry suspended in midair as he summons the help of an orbiting satellite. The satellite then receives its digital commands and sends down a beam of light, through the clouds, like something out of Final Fantasy VII. The beam then strikes the hapless recipient in a screen-clearing explosion that does considerable damage. On top of the supercharged melee is the presence of the crystal attack. By holding down the attack button you'll fill up your life bar with a yellow streak. When your bar fills up you'll receive a crystal above your meter. You can store up to three crystals, which, when activated by your character's particular crystal attack, will essentially launch a supercapture move that involves highly damaging, highly humiliating attacks, that also differ depending on proximity. Above all, Evil Zone features some of the most innovative moves you've seen in a fighter."", ""Balancing the all-out offensive blitz is the block button. The block button will essentially neutralize almost any attack and must be used prominently, or else you'll find yourself facing the dirt in no time. Certain attacks, depending on their power, will chip away at your life bar like any decent attack would. In fact, the block button comes in especially handy when someone launches an up-close-and-personal crystal attack. The camera will switch to a dynamic close-up view of you swatting away your opponent's ferocious attack with blinding ease. It's awesome to watch this game in action. The other thing that aids you in attack avoidance is the ability to side step. By pressing up or down, you'll walk into or out of the foreground. Jump attacks only occur when the D-pad is used in conjunction with the attack button, so the 3D movement may take some adjusting to. In any case, it works very well and is actually useful for avoiding unwanted damage."", 'Feature-wise, Evil Zone is your typical game with typical features (training mode, survival, versus, story, options). The most interesting mode would have to be the story mode. In story mode, each character has his own between-game attract screens that give the game a lot more personality than your usual ""now loading"" screen. After you\'ve met certain requirements, additional bonuses unlock, such as an illustration gallery, music player, narrator selects, and an encyclopedia. Each character\'s own particular tale is told through still shots, engine-based cutscenes, and some uniformly hilarious voice acting. Instead of using subtitles with the original Japanese language, Titus opted to go all out and re-record everyone\'s dialogue. Too bad the dubbing is about as good as those old kung-fu movies of the \'70s and \'80s. Mouths continue to move after the character is done talking and the actors sound like rejects from a high school play. Interestingly enough, the instruction booklet is also victim to an incredibly poor translation.', ""Graphically, the game is a mixed bag that leans in favor of its pros as opposed to its cons. The characters themselves look great, with sumptuous light sourcing lathered over each unique fighter. The characters are also nicely detailed and look great even up close. Each of the fighter's special attacks is unique to the user; they look great and are amazingly inventive. Whenever you pull off a special attack, particularly a capture attack, the camera switches to multiple dynamic angles that give you a truly cinematic view - simply the best seat in the house at all times, and you never see the same attack from the same angle. Should you use only one supermove throughout the whole game, the autocamera will find a new way for you to view it each time. The downside is when you look at the backgrounds, which offer nothing in the way of geographical variances (like Destrega and its multitiered arenas). Instead, the settings are completely flat, with simple 2D bitmaps as backgrounds. Also, the backgrounds have a tendency to warp and look pretty weak as a result. Nevertheless, you'll soon forget about it once the fireworks start zipping around."", 'The soundtrack is nicely done, with each character having his own personal score, giving everyone a distinct feel. Sound effects are also well done and suit every effect in the game so you get a good sense of the action. Like Psychic Force, the introduction is hand-animated and is a nice touch to this extremely fun game. While the endings are really short and based around one generic theme, the game offers a lot of replay value, especially if you have a friend to play against.', ""While this game could have been an all-out offensive smorgasbord like the first Bloody Roar, it manages to balance itself well, despite only having two buttons to work with. That simple scheme works out well here. Despite the odd exclusion of now-common features like analog support and Dual Shock vibration, the control is top-notch with response times being right on the money. The characters look cool, if a touch derivative, but once you see the flowing hair and awesome special attacks, critics will soon find themselves at a loss for words. While it's not the greatest game of all time, Evil Zone is extremely fun and it shows that Yuke's has learned something from its past experiences. Although it's hard to make an impression in the fighting genre nowadays, Evil Zone (despite the horrible name and iffy voice acting) is a game that's definitely worth picking up. --James Mielke <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Fights are made interesting with the introduction of Limit Breaks (devastating desperation attacks) and Materia, the curious colored crystals that let your party use magic and other special abilities. Materia can be found or purchased and mixed and matched to create all sorts of interesting effects. Best of all, there are more than enough hidden Materia, weapons, and optional plot sequences in the game to merit playing it through at least twice."", ""Some have gone as far as to call Final Fantasy VII the hands-down best game ever made. And if you enjoy a good Japanese-style RPG, chances are you will agree. However, Final Fantasy VII, for all its astonishing features, is not a game with the sort of mass appeal that its massive marketing blitz may lead you to believe. For one thing, you can't finish it in a sitting, as Final Fantasy VII will be a solid 40 to 50-hour commitment for the average role-playing gamer. Otherwise, you might be taken aback by the extensive, text-heavy dialogue; there is no speech at all in Final Fantasy VII, in the interest of letting your imagination do a little work. Though you will make many small-scale decisions over the course of the game, on the whole, the story follows a very linear path. This linearity is a by-product of the plot's complexity, however - certainly a respectable sacrifice."", 'Sony\'s translation of the original Japanese dialogue is direct and first-rate, much to the relief of Final Fantasy purists everywhere. Nitpickers may identify a very occasional spelling or grammar error (""Off course!"" agrees Cloud at the Golden Saucer battle arena), but otherwise this text-heavy game reads just right, flawlessly conveying each character\'s distinct personality. Even the foul-mouthed costars of the game retain their affronting attitudes, as Sony went as far as to translate certain four-letter words in the interest of staying true to the Japanese script. --Greg Kasavin <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Shadow Madness,,['PS1'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Shadow Madness (Game Only, Playstation, 1999)', 'It\'s difficult to find a game genre these days that isn\'t inhabited with both Japanese- and American-developed games. For whatever reason, however, the console RPG has been a Japanese mainstay for as long as many can remember - most US-developed console RPGs were simply PC ports or adaptations, not original content. Let it be said that Craveyard isn\'t the US\'s best ambassador in the realm of RPG development, and let\'s hope it isn\'t the last. Considering how long this game was in development, one would have hoped that Craveyard would have come up with something better than this. Welcome to the land of Arkose, a typically fantastic RPG world that\'s recently been plagued by self-destructing cities, a mind-scrambling disease, and a variety of other social maladies. Narrowly avoiding death in the blast that destroyed his hometown, the roguish good-guy Stinger seeks revenge against the mysterious force that tore his life to shreds. On his journey, Stinger meets Windleaf - a waifish elfin girl with mystical powers, and Harv-5 - a literally barrel-chested farm robot. Shadow Madness\' story is fairly dark, although it has its fair share of humorous dialog and situations. The long, two CD-spanning adventure\'s story develops nicely, even if it is a little cliche or contrived at times. Due to the fact that it was written for American audiences, Shadow Madness\' text is of generally high quality and blends humor and drama with a mostly favorable effect. Supplementing the nice text is an abundance of Arkosian historical texts, simply available should players want to know more about the land they\'re saving. Chances are they won\'t, however, as getting to the story is a chore - Shadow Madness is a boring, poorly executed game, filled with an abundance of just plain stupid design flaws. The game\'s general look and feel are remarkably similar to that of the recent Final Fantasy games, sporting polygonal characters roaming around prerendered backdrops. Battles occur, as in many console RPGs, randomly. The key to any console RPG is a competent battle engine and interface, and Shadow Madness generally lacks both. Battles are built around a poorly conceived menu system that requires you to sort through four submenus with the left and right shoulder buttons. While this can speed access menu navigation with practice, it never becomes truly intuitive. As Shadow Madness mimics Final Fantasy\'s active battle system, the thinking behind this implementation is understood, but the execution ultimately fails. While boss battles are a different story, battles generally boil down to simply attacking monsters until they\'re dead, with little emphasis on the use of magic or other strategic devices. Random encounters generally require little strategy and take just a little too long to be tolerable. Fortunately, many random encounters can be avoided before they begin, but overusing this innovative feature can be detrimental to your long-term health and result in wasted hours of supplementary character building. Many of the game\'s other problems stem from an annoying lack of design economy, resulting in a game that can be summed up as sloppy. Arkose is a world littered with innumerable useless items - for every useful item you find, you\'ll likely find five completely worthless ones that you\'ll quickly discarded to make room for other useful items in the annoyingly small backpack. Inventory management like this is a complete waste of the your time, and Shadow Madness is rife with it. When you go up levels, spells are generally handed out in groups of three, resulting in an extremely long list of spells in a small battle window, wasting valuable time in the pseudo-real-time battles. To top it off, a majority of these spells have almost meaningless names and only slightly varied effects when cast. Innovations such as double-damage with a carefully timed button press. Avoiding random encounters are nice to see in Shadow Madness, but this hardly begin to make up for the game\'s problems. <P>Whoever said ""Graphics don\'t matter"" never played Shadow Madness. Shadow Madness is truly hideous to behold in its own right - even worse when compared with the RPG masterpieces it seeks to emulate. To start, the game features the most heinous character art in an RPG. Stinger is a, er... ""colorful"" caricature of FF7\'s Cloud, sporting a natty ponytail, a cute little red vest and a big sword. Harv-5 is a barrel adorned with a tin cappuccino cup, googly eyes, and a straw hat. And Windleaf... well, she just has to be seen to be believed. Other character designs include an old man\'s head atop a floating dinner plate, and a fat woman with cheesy cyberpunk-like sunglasses. As if their core concepts weren\'t terrible enough, Shadow Madness\' artists spared just about all efforts to bring them to life. Monsters and characters alike are decidedly low on polygons, textures, and animation. If the frame rate were decent, this kind of problem could be overlooked - maybe. The spell ""effects"" generally consist of expanding spheres with different textures, or sloppily rendered FMV summon sequences that look far less impressive than the real-time summon spells of Final Fantasy VII. Attempting to stray from the current trend of polygonal world maps, Shadow Madness instead uses a truly bleak, crayon-drawn series of 2D maps with no detail or visual appeal whatsoever. In what could have been a nice touch, Craveyard added character portraits to all dialog boxes - unfortunately, the crude, cartoonish nature of the portraits is as bad as the rest of the game\'s art and takes any impact from the accompanying text. The rendered backgrounds range from extremely drab to average, doing nothing to improve the overwhelmingly terrible visual experience that is Shadow Madness. To re-create an eyesore of this caliber would truly take effort. Surprisingly enough, amidst all of this, Shadow Madness somehow manages to pull an above-average musical score. Sporting a large variety of tunes for every situation, the music subtly and attractively evokes the game\'s darker nature and avoids the over-the-top orchestrations most RPGs tend to employ. <P>Shadow Madness is a decent story shrouded by years of bad decisions. As painful as it is to say so, seeing Craveyard disband after threats of a Shadow Madness sequel almost seems like a good thing. Shadow Madness is a curiosity and a cautionary tale of development for the ages, and should remain little more than that. --Peter Bartholow <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Need for Speed II,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Are you ready to pit your driving savvy against six international courses? Pick one of eight mean machines and let's go! Need for Speed II is fast and realistic with detailed 3D graphics and full-circle view. And when you think you're ready try the two-player split-screen mode for teeth-grinding competition!"", 'Need For Speed II is the first realistic street racing game on the PlayStation since the original Need For Speed. Unlike Test Drive: Off-Road and Tokyo Highway Battle (which were exaggerated), or NASCAR and Mario Andretti (which were true to life, yet never left the track), Need For Speed II focuses on realistic racing in populated settings...and the chaos that ensues.', 'While it\'s trite to say, ""If you\'ve ever wanted to get behind the wheel of a (insert expensive car name here), then you\'ll be itching to play Need For Speed II,"" it\'s also true. The game does feature eight supercars: the Ferrari F50, Lotus GT1, Jaguar XJ220, Ford GT90, Lotus Esprit V8, McLarren F1, Italdesign Cala, and the Isdera Commendatore 112I. But while each resembles its real-life counterpart in appearance, the simplified play control doesn\'t come close to capturing the feel of driving the actual car. The tracks do provide a thrill however, and if you\'ve ever wanted to barrel downhill through a small Greek village, your fantasies will be fulfilled. With five other tracks to race through (Canada, Norway, Australia, Northern Europe, and Nepal), the variety of exotic locales will keep you entertained long after you\'re sick of the supercars (no matter which of the fifteen available colors you paint them).', ""Like most driving games before it, Need For Speed II sticks to the basics: You select a manual or automatic transmission; your goal is to cross the finish line in the shortest amount of time possible; and there are buttons to accelerate and brake. The game also features power slides, burnouts, a rear view, replays, a two-player split-screen mode (accomplished with minimal slowdown), tournament mode, four varied camera angles, and the ability to drive in reverse - but most of these were available in the original Need For Speed or have been touched upon in other next generation driving games. A unique feature of note, but hardly a selling point, is the extensive information on the cars featured in the game. It's neat to look at but doesn't add much. There is also an undisclosed number of hidden cars and tracks, that is if you beat the game under a certain amount of time."", ""Once you're behind the wheel, Need For Speed II kicks into gear. The control, while loose at first, is quite accurate - expect to crash often, though, until you master it. Each level is challenging, taking an hour or so to familiarize yourself with and hours to master. But once you memorize the tight turns, there isn't much surprise left, aside from the hidden shortcuts in most levels. The most frustrating feature is the game's myriad crashes - pileups occur whenever you hit a car and you'll flip numerous times when you get too close to a wall at high speeds (no physical damage shows up on your car, but it takes you out of the race momentarily). Some courses will also try your patience; prepare to use your brakes often."", ""Need For Speed II looks really good. The 3-D texture-mapped graphics are on par with most N64 titles, although there is a significant amount of pop-up and the occasional backdrop looks flat or jagged. What is most impressive is that Electronic Arts has created a game on a 32-bit platform that, at least graphically, rivals the N64's Cruis'n USA. The sound is also quite good, featuring an electronic Euro-style soundtrack and realistic sound effects. In terms of presentation, the game scores big points."", ""Overall, Need For Speed II is the PlayStation's slickest racer yet, with its mix of realistic locales, superior graphics, and fast cars. It's more realistic than Ridge Racer and more of an arcade game than NASCAR Racing, and the combination should score with die-hard and casual genre fans alike. Simply put: Short of a Cannonball Run-esque plot, Need For Speed II has it all (although let's face it, who wouldn't like to see Dom DeLuise and Burt Reynolds in a driving game?). --Glenn Rubenstein <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Street Fighter Alpha 3,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"['<i>Street Fighter Alpha 3</i> features various modes of fighting action.  The Arcade mode is a direct translation of the arcade version, though the home  version now includes added special effects during combat sequences. The Versus  mode allows you to select all playable characters for hand-to-hand battle. New  to the Alpha series is the World Tour mode, which allows you to fight opponents  throughout the world. The popular <i>Street Fighter</i> series continues with a  multitude of new moves, specials, and super combos.', 'Street Fighter Alpha 3 on the PlayStation was a great translation, and the extra modes really brought a lot to the game. The Dreamcast version of Alpha 3 keeps all the great modes and additions from the PlayStation version but also uses the more powerful hardware to its benefit, delivering larger character sizes, sharper and more colorful graphics, and extremely minimal load times. <P>With Street Fighter 3 shooting off into an entirely new world with lots of new characters and Capcom\'s versus series of fighters pitting the Street Fighters against various comic book characters, the Alpha series is really the only ""classic"" Street Fighter line left. That\'s not to say that it\'s grown stagnant. Even though it\'s chock-full of characters that we\'ve been extremely familiar with for close to a decade, the little touches here and there and the addition of new fighters keep the game fresh enough to maintain its relevancy. <P>Moving on from Street Fighter Alpha 2, Alpha 3 maintains the same gameplay, though a few new options bring a lot of variety to the game. After you select your character, you\'re given a choice of three different fighting styles, termed ""isms,"" which govern the way your super combos work. A-ism gives you multiple super combos that can be executed at three different levels, much like the standard alpha combos in Alpha 1 and 2. V-ism gives you variable combos, which behave much like the custom combo feature introduced in Alpha 2. X-ism returns to Super Street Fighter II Turbo-style combos, where you only have one combo, but it\'s much more powerful than your average A-ism combo. There are also a few other subtle differences in the isms, such as the ability to air block. <P>World Tour mode brings a ton of single-player value to Alpha 3. The mode is basically set up a lot like Soul Blade\'s edge master mode. You travel from stage to stage, fighting in matches that have various requirements, such as time attacks, survival matches, and fights where only combos do damage. As you progress, you\'ll earn experience points and add-ons called ism-pluses, which grant you things like air blocking, charging super meters, and increased block meter damage. You can then import these world-tour fighters into the game\'s other modes, but they won\'t gain any experience in other portions of the game. Add to this little quick modes like survival and dramatic battle (which lets you play a three-player, two-on-one game), and you\'ve got enough modes to keep you busy whether you\'re playing alone or with friends. <P>Graphically, Street Fighter Alpha 3 has an outstanding look. The characters are large, colorful, and well animated. The backgrounds also look quite nice. The audio is about what you\'d expect from a Street Fighter game, making good use of stereo separation as the action travels from one side of the screen to the other. The music is also quite good. <P>The Dreamcast controller again proves that it isn\'t cut out for Street Fighter-style fighting games. Though not as bad an offender as Marvel vs. Capcom was, the controller\'s top buttons simply aren\'t as responsive as they need to be for this type of game. It may work well if you\'re driving a car, but trying to pull off Dragon Punches with them is a different story. Again, as with Marvel vs. Capcom, you\'re going to want to spend a little extra money and get Sega\'s arcade-style joystick, which solves every single problem posed by the DC\'s standard controller. <P>If you\'ve already purchased Alpha 3 on the PlayStation, that may very well be enough. But the Dreamcast version is a flawless conversion of the arcade game, with more options than its PlayStation counterpart. It\'d be worth an import if the domestic version wasn\'t scheduled to ship so soon. Wait for the US release, which is currently scheduled for October. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Soul Calibur - Sega Dreamcast,,['For Sega Dreamcast Systems'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Featuring graphics that surpass even the amazing <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000K4C9/${0}""><i>NFL 2K</i></a>, <i>Soul Calibur</i> is the martial arts fighting game to end all fighting games and <I>the</I> game to get if you\'re a Dreamcast owner. Based on the arcade classic of the same name, <i>Soul Calibur</i> lets you choose to represent one of 10 fighters in a series of battles against your peers. If you can successfully defeat all of your opponents, you will then face the fiendish Inferno in a final showdown that will determine the fate of the world. Each of the game\'s warriors is armed with a different deadly weapon--sword, ax, stave, nunchaku, you name it--and an assortment of special moves all tailored to that specific weapon. The warriors include men, women, and creatures from all over the globe and from various mythologies. Each is brought to life with amazing motion-capture animation, which results in incredibly lifelike and realistic duels. If you own a Dreamcast or are thinking of buying one, do yourself a favor and add <i>Soul Calibur</i> to your collection. <i>--Mike Ryan</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Exceptionally lifelike graphics and animation</li> <li>Multiple game modes--1-player, 2-player, team, computer vs. computer, martial arts demo, and more</li> <li>Secrets and extra features will keep players coming back</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>May be too violent for some parents</li> </ul>', 'Let\'s get one thing out of the way: Soul Calibur is the best 3D fighting game ever released in the arcades. Better than Virtua Fighter 3. Better than Tekken 3. If that weren\'t enough, the Dreamcast version one-ups the original arcade release in just about every way imaginable. Now that we\'ve established that, let\'s explore why, and what it is about the Dreamcast version that raises the bar on fighting games in general. <P>From its debut at the 1998 Electronics Entertainment Expo, tucked away in a remote corner of Namco\'s booth, it was obvious that Soul Calibur was something special. Namco had pushed the PlayStation-based System 12 hardware farther than anyone had a right to expect from such a modest chipset. Namco took what it had learned from Tekken 3 and built on the ambitious, but limited, Soul Edge fighting engine. Soul Calibur was not only a substantial leap in graphics, but in gameplay as well. Employing a new eight-way directional system in conjunction with a physics engine that took weapon weight into account, Soul Calibur\'s gameplay reached new heights in both complexity and depth. Perhaps one of the most crucial additions was the inclusion of the tech-roll found in Tekken 3. No more lying on the ground as your opponent rained down attacks from the sky. Just a quick tap of the guard button and you were back on your feet, quick as a whistle. Graphically, the game was a fireworks display of particle effects, complex polygonal character models, and a light-sourcing tour de force, all running at a blazing 60 frames-per-second. <P>The short of it is, if you haven\'t played Soul Calibur, you need to. For sheer adrenaline working in tandem with eye-melting graphics, nothing could touch it. What then, does the Dreamcast version (Namco\'s first ""real"" game developed for archrival Sega in ages) of Soul Calibur do to leapfrog past its arcade counterpart in every way possible? <P>To begin with, the most obvious enhancement are the graphics. Despite the lack of a prerendered FMV intro, the likes of which we\'re used to seeing from Namco, the opening offered here will drop more jaws than Muhammed Ali. Think of the intros usually seen in Capcom games like Marvel vs. Capcom, but rendered in full, hi-res, 60fps 3D (with a splash of Samurai Shodown thrown in for good measure), and you\'re not even close to imagining how awesome the intro to Soul Calibur for the DC looks. Picture a first-person camera zooming in over some sandy horizon, as weapons slam into the foreground. Keep going until the weapons are replaced by a swiftly approaching Kilik (the staff user in SC). Trigger an impressive sequence of character cameos and a dynamic soundtrack, and there you have it. This has to be seen in person to appreciate. It looks so good it might as well be CG, because five years ago, graphics like these were impossible. <P>The reason the arcade version couldn\'t be ported home to the PlayStation was due to hardware limitations. Despite the fine conversion of Tekken 3 to the PlayStation, Soul Calibur on System-12 used an extremely high amount of RAM to enable effects like Z-buffering and other processor-taxing effects - effects that were not present in Tekken 3. The Dreamcast, on the other hand, represented the perfect solution to Namco\'s problems. With hardware roughly ten times as powerful as the PlayStation, the DC can not only manage Soul Calibur\'s graphic fireworks, but also enhance them by leaps and bounds. With characters boasting not only improved polygon counts, but high-resolution textures, each member of Soul Calibur moves around each stage looking larger, tougher, more solid, and more detailed than ever before. For example, Astaroth\'s alternate costume sprouts Godzilla-like spikes out of his back (these spikes wobble as he moves), along with a tall Alfalfa-esque hairdo that swings and sways depending on what direction he\'s moving in. Soul Edge alumni and Siegfried\'s alter ego, Nightmare, wields the Soul Edge itself, with an eyeball set in the center that looks around at the proceedings independently of the sword. Details like hair, clothing, and accessories all move in rhythm with an extremely realistic physics model. Improving the quality of the characters wasn\'t enough for Namco\'s programmers though. They also added a muscle-flexing system that causes pectorals to ripple during victory poses, breasts and buttocks to jiggle realistically (read: subtle, not exaggerated as in Dead or Alive), and skin to stretch in a most natural way, with not a polygon tear in sight. These characters look incredible, and some benefit from the enhancements more than others (Lizardman\'s tail no longer looks like a polygonal mess). Everything looks perfectly smooth (especially faces), with minimal blockiness, putting the models in VF3tb to shame. This is an extremely solid-looking game. The characters have also been outfitted with an extensive set of facial expressions that add greatly to the game experience. Take Mitsurugi, for example. With every sword slash accompanied by a grunt or yell, his face synchronizes the appropriate expression as well. Even during win poses, each character mouths his own victory speech. Even little things like fingers are individually rendered. <P>Weapons are also impressive enough to simply sit back and watch: The blades on Voldo\'s twin katars move independently; Kilik\'s bo flexes with each swing; and metallic weapons like Mitsurugi\'s sword feature specular highlighting (think Gran Turismo, but better) that reflects the environment around it. Other things, like head tracking, dust clouds kicked up by the characters\' feet, and amazing real-time shadows (check out Ivy\'s flaccid whip-sword in practice mode for a good idea of how cool simple shadows can be), round out the visual impact. Soul Calibur is so detail-intensive that even your character\'s breath can be seen on some stages. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Hydro Thunder,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"[""You've never seen anything like it!  Hydro Thunder is a high-speed, 3D super boat racer that uses Newtonian physics to emulate the feel of real thunder boat racing.  Players actually feel the boats respond to waves, wild terrain and roadblocks with a realism unmatched in any other game.  Hydro Thunder includes ten vividly rendered tracks and 9 unique boats.  Each track contains short-cuts, ramps and turbo-boost icons that give players a burst of speed and invulnerability.  The incredible graphics are not to be believed and a split-screen mode allows head-to-head competitive play.  Afraid of the water?  Get over it.  Release is currently scheduled for 09/09/1999 (subject to change)."", 'When you think about racing games, you naturally think of wheels - be it two, four, six, or ten. The most memorable racing games have put you on some sort of road. Why is that? Perhaps air is too bland in its sheer openness, and water simply doesn\'t deliver insane jumps, tight corners, and clever tracks. Prepare to reevaluate that opinion, because the best boat-racing game to hit arcades has made its way to the Dreamcast - but what it hasn\'t done is brought anything new with it. <P>If you\'ve played the arcade version of Hydro Thunder, you already know everything about the game. So little has changed, in fact, that you\'ll wonder if Eurocom even made an attempt to do anything more than port the game\'s code to the Dreamcast. There\'s no intro, no new modes, no CG of any form - just the simple single-race-then-start-over play style that you\'d expect from an arcade game. It\'s almost as if Midway were satisfied with simply changing ""insert coin"" to ""press start"" and was done. This game has only two modes - play on your own, or play with a friend. There\'s no time trial, no tournament, no battle or practice mode, just the pay-per-race-styled ""game"" mode that you\'re already familiar with. And once you\'re actually in the game, there\'s not a whole lot you can do besides race. There\'s no difficulty control besides the actual track you pick; the mid-race pause menu has no options control; and the game doesn\'t even allow you to restart your race. You\'ll have to quit out to the title screen and choose your track and boat all over again. But what the user interface is lacking, Hydro Thunder more than makes up for in gameplay. <P>Boat-racing games have had little success because of the vast difference in physics from conventional street racers and the inability to replicate this difference accurately. Hydro Thunder breaks that trend and shows that boat racing is indeed a different dish. The engine was built entirely from the ground up, and it\'s clear that the team had spent plenty of time making the physics as real as they\'ve ever been in a boat game. Probably the most impressive aspect of the engine is that you can see your boat bounce in the wake created by another racer. These effects, combined with the realistic nature of the game engine easily make Hydro Thunder the best racing game to hit the water. <P>Speed is a racing game\'s most essential attribute, and Hydro Thunder has plenty of it. Even with tons of on-screen activity the frame rate is silky smooth, and pop-up simply doesn\'t exist. In the first-person view a breathtaking sense of speed is achieved, with only slight diminishment in the other views. The graphics are simply amazing. All the different flavors of boat racing are represented in Hydro Thunder - from catamarans to powerboats to nuclear-powered concept racers. And each boat not only has a distinctive hull shape, but it also has distinctive markings and flair. But that\'s just the beginning. The real eye candy is contained within the tracks. The track design is really innovative, and it takes advantage of the water setting. There are approximately three different types of water present in Hydro Thunder. The deep water comes in two types - calm or choppy, which are easily distinguishable by the excellent graphical effects. The third type of water is the calm shallows, from where you can see the river\'s bed, which is often littered with buried treasure, sunken ships, hungry sharks, or derelict aircraft. But easily what is most impressive about Hydro Thunder\'s graphics is how much you can see. All the tracks have hugely detailed backgrounds, and, as stated earlier, pop-up has taken an exit. <P>Not only does each boat have a distinct graphical look, it also sports its own engine effects. Some engines give the throaty growl of 16-cylinder gas guzzler, while others have more of a high-tech whine. The sound effects are done well, with good use of voice effects in the form of your aviator\'s private radio and the announcer. The music is all tense race-it-up-type music that makes it easy to use a lead foot. <P>If the Dreamcast controller excels at any genre, I\'d have to say it is racing. The analog buttons on each shoulder are easily the most comfortable and intuitive setup I\'ve used in a while, and it gives you better control than the arcade version did. The boost-jump is incredibly easy to use, and it helps you take full advantage of every track\'s secrets. The game\'s thirteen courses are full of huge falls, hidden areas, jumps, tunnels, shortcuts, and more. Want to tunnel through an ice cave? You can. Want to race under the docks of Venice? Do it. Feel like racing through King Tut\'s tomb? It\'s all you. <P>Unfortunately, the game\'s AI is a bit frustrating. It would seem that the computer-controlled opponents are faster depending on which boat you select. If you choose a faster, more difficult boat to control, you\'ll be up against faster opponents. This makes it a bit lopsided, as you get none of the pros but all the cons inherent in choosing a more difficult boat. So, in short, the best boats to select are the slowest ones, unless you\'re less concerned with winning the race than you are with placing the fastest time. Perhaps the most frustrating element of Hydro Thunder is the outright difficulty. You always start in fifteenth place, and the only way you can win a race is by hitting every boost, taking every shortcut, and hitting no walls. As if that weren\'t enough, Hydro Thunder retains the time gates - an arcade element. This makes finding shortcuts more accidental than intentional, as you\'ve no time to stop and explore the track. <P>Hydro Thunder was the best boat racing game to ever hit the arcade, and the Dreamcast version carries that tradition to the consoles. However, it suffers from a user-unfriendly interface and brings absolutely no extras home. Without a tournament mode, the game\'s replay value is hindered incredibly, and the lack of practice modes or time trials make the learning curve very steep. Hydro Thunder is a game I desperately wanted to like, but I was ultimately discouraged by the actual game because of the still-present arcade feel. At its core, Hydro Thunder is still a very exciting, edge-of-your-seat racer that offers awesome graphics and a solid engine, but in the end it almost punishes you for liking it. --Ben Stahl <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Shadow Man,,"['Rated ""M"" - Animated Blood and Gore, Violence', '1 Player', 'Analog Control Compatible']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Send Evil back to Darkness. Live the nightmare. PS1.', 'When a publisher lists Sylvia Path as inspiration for a new game, as Acclaim does with Shadow Man, you know you\'re dealing with a different kind of game (or at least a different kind of development team). According to its creators, the third-person 3D adventure Shadow Man was inspired as much by poet Plath, and painters Bruegel and Bosch, as by Mario.  <P>But wintery New Englander Plath, for all her dark desolation, couldn\'t be farther from the Southern bayou, savage, exotic feel of voodoo New Orleans, where Shadow Man is set. Main character Mike LeRoi is an English lit graduate, and like many with such degrees, he has trouble finding work in his chosen field. He instead becomes a part-time hit man, spending his days sending men to the shadow world. His career is abruptly cut short, however, when he, along with his family, is killed in a car accident.  <P>Meanwhile, Mama Nettie, a powerful force in the New Orleans voodoo world, dreams of the Apocalypse. She sees five serial killers open portals between the world of the living - Liveside - and the world of the dead - Deadside. And the Five guide the damned souls through the portals, then use them to take over Liveside. <P>In terror, Mama Nettie creates the Mask of Shadows, resurrects LeRoi, and implants the mask in his chest, transforming him into the voodoo warrior Shadow Man, whose task is to prevent the early Apocalypse Mama Nettie envisioned.  <P>As Shadow Man, you load each hand up with one of 50 weapons, from the Shadowgun to the .50 Desert Eagle, enabling you to kill twice as quickly. Visibility in game environments is remarkable - you see well into the horizon, and the fog is far more for effect than cover-up. Iguana UK attributes this to its VISTA (Virtually Integrated Scenic TerrAin) engine, which takes advantage of binary space partition technology and essentially lets you see all the way to the horizon - without having to shroud anything in fog.  <P>And the seeing is a pleasure when the graphics are as good as these. The version of the game we saw was running on a high-end PC with a 3Dfx card, so the graphics on the Nintendo and PlayStation will obviously be different. But the graphics are incredibly lush - and creepy. <P>From the Asylum to the London Underground, you\'ll cross over from the world of the living to the world of the dead, both equally unnerving in completely different ways: Each Liveside location is home to one of the serial killers (like the Florida Everglades, the New York tenements), and each Deadside environment is filled with dead people and zombies. <P>Because you can use both hands, you\'ll have the advantage of being able to do two things at once, much like a real person can - you can fire your gun with one hand and pick up keys, unlock a door, or perform some similarly useful action with the other. Or, as Guy Miller, project manager for Shadow Man, points out, you can do all kinds of things like ""Killing, with two guns. Killing, with one gun and a voodoo weapon. Killing, with a gun in one hand and a flashlight in the other. Killing, with a gun in one hand as you pull yourself up a cliff face with the other hand. Killing, with a voodoo weapon in one hand as you hang with the other hand from a rope suspended above a chasm.... The killing permutations of the player-character\'s ambidexterity are pretty much endless."" <P>Shadow Man is a third-person adventure and bears the inevitable comparison to Tomb Raider. There is some similarity in play, but bringing that up seems to irk Miller. ""Tomb Raider is fundamentally linear, fundamentally a flick-a-switch shooter, fundamentally annoying in that each jump you make must be pixel-perfect, and you get punished for not making that pixel-perfect jump. Shadow Man is nonlinear, is not merely a flick-a-switch shooter, will not punish you with pixel-perfect jumps, and has locational gameplay, inasmuch as the environments will dictate the type of gameplay."" Gameplay, he argues, is instead a combination of Marioesque platform/puzzle-solving (about 50 percent) and bloody gore fests (50 percent). <P>Also, Iguana UK has designed Shadow Man as a more nonlinear game. You still have certain tasks that must be accomplished before others are even attempted, but you\'ll also play through sections where the levels can be completed in any order you choose, and some backtracking and zigzagging through levels is required in order to complete the game. But whichever path you choose through the game, all routes lead to a single end. ""There\'s a mystery at the heart of the game,"" Miller says, ""the answer to which\'ll blow your mind and make you wonder if you\'re really playing a game at all.""

Heck, the third game in the series, Resident Evil 3 Nemesis, was released on the PlayStation two weeks ago, and the fourth installment, Resident Evil: Code Veronica, is due out for the Dreamcast in Japan in a few months, with a US translation trailing only a bit behind. Somehow, though, RE2 doesn\'t feel old or tired at all. And it\'s as impressive today on the N64 as it was in January of \'98, when it first debuted on the PlayStation. Part of that is due to how impressive it is as a port. The game takes the contents of two PlayStation discs - including all the FMV sequences and the bonus Hunk and Tofu missions - and fits it into one 512-megabit N64 cartridge, which ends up being twice the size of The Legend of Zelda cart, for the record. The only thing missing in this edition is the extreme-battle mode from the Dual Shock edition of Resident Evil 2 on the PlayStation, but the omission is made up for by new features, such as a randomizer (which shuffles items around after you\'ve played the game through once) and files (which you can find to learn details about the Resident Evil story, some of which have bits that tie in with Resident Evil 3 Nemesis and Resident Evil: Code Veronica). You can also change the blood color from red to green or blue, or set the violence to low, medium, or high. Sure, and the gang\'s all here. You play as Leon Kennedy, the rookie cop who has reported for his first shift on the day the T-virus outbreak turns the whole town into zombies, or as Claire Redfield, who has come to Raccoon City to find her older brother, the male lead from the first Resident Evil. To make matters worse, the creator of the T-virus has developed a more perfect virus, which he ingests when the nefarious Umbrella Corporation sends in troops to steal it from him. (In the process, he\'s become a monster that could even give RE\'s Tyrant pause). Yes, as either character, you end up in the middle of company politics and a lot of sharp, gnashing teeth. Resident Evil 2 on the PlayStation was full of moments that made you sense that something was going to pop out and attack you (and invariably, something did as soon as you stopped expecting it), and that\'s reproduced perfectly here. The sound effects are fantastic, whether it\'s the moan and shuffle of a zombie that\'s just around the corner or the crunch of your footsteps as you step over broken glass. And save for a slightly tinny quality, the sounds and the dramatic score of the game are just as good on cart as they were on CD.  The graphics are even more of a wonder. If you use the N64 expansion pak, the visuals are bumped into hi-res mode, making them look even better than those in the PlayStation version. But even without the pak, they\'re still very impressive. Sometimes, the backgrounds look washed out while the characters remain brightly hued, making them stand out strangely, but it\'s a very rare occasion when that happens. The game\'s frame rate also slows down a bit when numerous monsters are onscreen at once, but not enough to affect gameplay. And though the computer-generated FMV sequences look grainy in comparison with the PlayStation version, they still look fantastic considering the cart format. Of course, the same complaints relevant to the PlayStation original still apply to the N64 version. You\'ll find that the camera is your worst enemy: When you move into an area of the room that you hadn\'t been able to see before you\'ll get ambushed by several zombies that were standing just into the next screen. Or when you\'re blasting away at a boss or sub-boss, the recoil of your weapon will knock you into another screen, and you\'ll get killed because you don\'t know which side you\'re going to be attacked from. And you\'ll continue to believe that the strange inventory system should\'ve long since been changed to something more like Diablo\'s ""smaller items take up less space/big items take up more space"" system. But even with those few detractions, Resident Evil 2 is still as much an experience as it is a game. A huge improvement over the first title, RE2 succeeds in making you feel as though you\'re in the middle of a horror film - one in which you\'ll jump many, many times. If you\'ve already played the PlayStation or PC versions of RE2, there\'s really no reason to buy this game, but for N64 owners who haven\'t tried yet, it\'s an absolute must-have.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Great shape!', 'It\'s been two and a half years since Pac-Man World first popped its head up at the 1997 E3 in Atlanta. At the time, it looked like an attempt by the American development team to ""pull a Mario"" on its legendary mascot. Even two years ago, the game didn\'t really look all that great, and as a result, the original development team was pulled and, after much hemming and hawing, work resumed on the project.  <P>It has now been 20 years since the ""little yellow dot that could"" emerged on the video-game map, and much has happened since then. Gameplay mechanics can no longer rely on such simple control schemes, and Namco has had its hands full trying to inaugurate its armless/legless character into the digital age. The good news is that whatever Namco has done to the pill popper known as Pac-Man, the current Pac-Man World has turned out great. Staying true to the format, it is a title full of charm, ingenuity, and playability. <P>While this is no Mario 64 or Sonic Adventure, Pac-Man World could at least be described as Klonoa-lite. It seems as if Pac-Man\'s mortal enemy, Toc-Man, has kidnapped Ms. Pac Man, Pac Jr., Baby Pac, Professor Pac, Pooka (from Dig-Dug) and Chomp Chomp the dog-pac. (Tupac was, apparently, nowhere to be found.) Naturally, it is up to Pac-Man to find and rescue his friends from Toc-Man\'s hiding spots, which include desert islands, deep-space outposts, and mine shafts. While not in possession of the vast array of moves that his bunny-like counterpart possesses, Pac-Man has learned a few things along the way. As befits any mascot worth his salt, a butt-bounce has been implemented to take care of opening chests and dispatching enemies of a nonghostly nature. He also has a power shot (which uses energy) an ultra-butt-bounce, and, of course, the power pellet, which he will use to chomp on Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde.  <P>Throughout the game, there is a large number of puzzles for you to find; you use the ol\' ""find the key, open the door"" techniques to achieve your goal. Along the way, you will encounter enemies to vanquish, b-doing platforms to launch yourself to spots too high to reach with a normal jump. You must find buttons and jump on them to open doors that may hold the keys you\'ll need to open other doors. Pac-Man also has a spin-roll move he can use to zip up hills he cannot climb, and a rev-run that generates power to propeller-platforms scattered around the game. While some aspects of Pac-Man World could be viewed as derivative, there are definitely moments that Pac-Man can call his own. While this may seem fairly standard, and it is, the game is very well designed, and the graphics are rich and convincing. The backgrounds look like a cross between Klonoa\'s and Crash Bandicoot\'s, which is a very good thing. In addition to that, Pac-Man himself has a large variety of facial expressions, making him practically irresistible. He has facial expressions for every activity - swimming, walking, running, or just standing around. He is very well animated (for a round yellow man-thing, that is) and the control is top-notch. The challenges in the game boast a fair and gradual learning curve. Should you find certain Galaxian doors, you will be transported to bonus levels that are 3D versions of old-school Pac-Man maps, where you eat dots and try to chomp the ghosts. As you discover these secret levels, you will unlock them in the puzzle-mode, which features more than 30 mazes. The original Pac-Man game - just like the kind found in the Namco Museum games - is included in its entirety, as well. Between these two options and the twenty-plus levels in the platforming game, there is more replay value here than one might have expected from a game of such humble origins.  <P>With all the crappy ""Xtreme"" sports games flooding the market, along with uninspired first-person shooters, racing games, and rip-off platformers, it\'s encouraging to see one of the originators come back in style. While the simple gameplay and cutesy premise may turn off some so-called ""hard-core gamers,"" anyone with an open mind would do well to pick up the Pacster\'s newest offering. Basically an unpretentious offering that hold its own as a platformer, Pac-Man World is a fun little game that goes beyond mere regurgitation. This one is worthy of anyone\'s library. Don\'t call it a comeback. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The first episode forces you to deal with hundreds of insane turkeys, while the second pits you against hundreds of mutant clones. The enemies change, but the game pretty much remains the same. You, playing as one of the four kids, pick up the other three kids. From there, you have a couple levels packed with the enemy du jour as well as with larger versions of enemies called tanks, which generate the smaller monsters. Occasionally, you'll get tossed into a level where you must destroy several tanks very quickly to keep them from destroying South Park. Then you'll face the level's boss, save the town from destruction, listen to Chef talk about how good you are, and move on. The Chef cutscenes are done in prerendered video clips, and they look as though someone had hooked the N64 version of the game up to a VCR, recorded all the clips, and digitized them for the PlayStation version. The game also has two-player multiplayer, but the weapons (dodge balls, dart guns, etc.), level design (way too big), and player movement (eternally sluggish) really don't lend themselves very well to the multiplayer game."", ""Speaking of level design, it's really quite bad, but given the license, it at least makes sense. You'll spend a good portion of your time in extremely large, open areas, such as the middle of the street, large fields, and the like. This leads to a very close horizon, complete with loads of pop-up. Plus, since the ground and fog are both white, you'll eventually spend some time staring at a completely white screen, hoping that you're actually moving and not just bumping up against a wall of snow. Sure, it's a cold, snowy Colorado town, so visibility is naturally low, but it still gets in the way of the gameplay. So with the fog as bad as it is, you're forced to stare at your radar almost constantly."", ""South Park (the show) has a pretty basic art style. It's pretty hard to mess it up. But the PlayStation version, with its reduced-poly models and bad video quality, somehow manages to look absolutely terrible. The only thing uglier than the graphics is the in-game sound - 90 percent of it is the repetitive, super-annoying noises made by the monsters. Five minutes of constant turkey gobbling in the first level will be enough to drive some from the game. Also, the kids speak from time to time, usually to announce that you've acquired a weapon or item, but this, too, is extremely limited and repetitive."", ""Between the abysmal graphics, bad sound, and horrible gameplay, South Park is definitely one of those games that is bound to come up when you start thinking about the worst game you've ever played. It's a real throwback to the days of completely worthless games with decent licenses - the kind Acclaim used to be infamous for back in the days of 8-bit and 16-bit gaming. South Park fans looking for some interactive action would do well to wait for South Park Rally or Chef's Luv Shack. --Jeff Gerstmann <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

This is evidenced by the impending deluge of Resident Evil/Biohazard spin-offs; Resident Evil: Code Veronica, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Oni-Musha (the RE-style samurai game), and now Dino Crisis. A brand new excursion into the world of survival-horror, Dino Crisis is a fresh experience that abandons that creepy Umbrella laboratory for a taste of Jurassic Park. Not only that, but Dino Crisis is unique in that it so closely borrows from the RE series. But in regards to the storyline, this game is not related to it Resident Evil at all. <P>Conceived and directed by Shinji Mikami, the mastermind behind the RE games, Dino Crisis will be very familiar to anyone who\'s played the Resident Evil games. The dramatic camera perspectives, the control scheme, and the eerie settings are all classic Mikami. However, instead of slow-moving zombies shuffling after you like drunks staggering home, you\'re faced with velociraptors and other big lizards with lightning-fast reflexes and huge appetites. <P>""This isn\'t a joke, you idiot! We were just attacked by a big-ass lizard!"" says Dino Crisis femme-fatale, Regina, to her computer-expert cohort, Rick, who, at the time, is trying to unlock electronically secured doors throughout the base where you\'ve been searching for the missing Dr. Kirk. Your other teammate, Gail, is missing, and the last you heard from him were some aborted screams and the sound of gunfire. <P>As you might now know, the backgrounds in Dino Crisis are fully polygonal as opposed to prerendered CG stills, like they are in Resident Evil. Perhaps it took Capcom all this time to get up to speed with the PlayStation hardware, but this makes all the difference in the world. Despite being completely 3D, the game still moves at the same speed as its brethren, without any slowdown. The game\'s graphics are also very sharp and appear to be running in a medium to high resolution. The character models are very well done, with excellent light-sourcing effects, giving Regina and her posse a very solid feel. The use of polygonal backgrounds enhances the feeling of fear even more than Resident Evil. For example, when you\'re walking down a hallway, viewed from a typical RE-ish perspective, it becomes even more tense when the camera angle suddenly pivots to an overhead perspective or swings to a worm\'s-eye view. The engine also allows for shifting camera positions rendered on the fly, keeping Dino Crisis moving along at a quicker tempo than Resident Evil\'s. Thankfully, the camera, with all its flexibility, is not abused or overused by any means. It is used sparingly, and only to enhance rather than to distract. <P>Since the game is completely 3D, it is not as easy to pick out necessary clues as it had been in Resident Evil because everything looks uniform. In Resident Evil you\'d be able to tell what to look out for since the polygonal details would stick out from the prerendered backgrounds. In Dino Crisis, you must really be on the lookout for anything and everything. The camera angles are vintage RE, designed to provide the maximum tension possible. If that weren\'t enough, the soundtrack is designed to provide chills and thrills as well. The simple act of walking down a hallway becomes a terrifying exercise in fear when the violins start playing. If you\'re not too chicken, this game is best played in the dark with the volume up. <P>As previously stated, the controls in Dino Crisis are virtually identical to Resident Evil\'s, with a couple of crucial enhancements. Since the basic control configuration works well enough, potential problems arise since velociraptors are a lot quicker and savvier than RE\'s zombies. As a result, adjustments to the combat system were necessary to avoid an unwanted Regina-burger. When you press the R2 button, your character does a 180-degree turnabout, allowing you to put some space between you and your pursuer before turning around and filling your opponent with lead. The second enhancement is the ability to walk with your gun held out, primed to fire. While you walk slower with your gun outstretched, it sure beats making a sitting duck of yourself each time you want to fire your weapon. With all this meat-eating terror stalking the hallways (and windows and air-vents, etc.) it would get annoying to have to manage the ribbon-saving system found in Resident Evil. Instead, Dino Crisis features save rooms that prompt you to record your data whenever you attempt to leave or pass through one of these rooms. The number of times you save (or continue, should you die) affects your final score/rating and should be used sparingly.  <P>The details in Dino Crisis are excellent too. If she takes a little damage, Regina will hold her side, limping a bit. If she takes a lot of damage, she\'ll be absolutely stagger around. She\'ll also drip blood on the floor, adding to the realism in Dino Crisis. Fortunately, there are plenty of power-ups (health kits, weapons, etc.), and an accessory-customization system similar to the one in Parasite Eve. Other things like head tracking, and auto-aiming sort out any additional combat-oriented complaints from the RE series as well. Interestingly, analog support does not seem to be featured, although the Dual Shock action is intact. Loading times between rooms are also severely reduced, due to the polygonal environments that take less space to store in memory.  <P>So, from the looks of things, it appears as if Capcom has another winner on its hands. Dino Crisis is less disturbing than the RE series, but possibly more frightening since each of the creatures in DC hold about the same shock value as the Dobermans did in Resident Evil. While cannibalizing its own library could have backfired with a ""been there, done that"" aftertaste, Dino Crisis walks away under the strength of its own merits. The control improvements and graphic reinvention make DC its own game, with little owed to Resident Evil. The storyline is sound, and the replay value is high, with three different endings to reveal and a multitude of secrets to find (multiple costumes, a timed dinosaur hunt, mini Regina and giant Regina, etc.). With Oni-Musha, Nemesis, and Code Veronica on the horizon, Capcom might have this genre all to itself. While games like Carrier, Blue Stinger, and Alone In the Dark 4 will try and crowd the limelight with similar offerings, for the time being, it looks as if Capcom is king of the survival-horror hill. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Between bites of pizza or slurps of soda, you played as a warrior of light slapped into an endless series of randomly generated dungeon levels, where you fought a slew of evil denizens. Not too long ago, Gauntlet suffered the fate of many classic games: It was given a major facelift and reinvented for the '90s. Unfortunately, Gauntlet Legends wasn't a particularly good arcade game, and it isn't any better on the N64. <P>Those of you unfamiliar with the arcade version of the remake  will at least be familiar with the unchanged premise. You still act as one of four characters (warrior, valkyrie, wizard, or archer) who make a stand against a seemingly bottomless reservoir of baddies. All the while you'll collect treasure, play with magic, and dish out the hurt. However, there have been some additions to the formula: You'll now be able to buy stuff with that treasure; levels now have themes; and you'll have to go up against bosses at the end of certain stages. And now our little elven archer buddy is a she. <P>Gauntlet Legends takes advantage of Nintendo's RAM pak, but don't expect it to look nearly as good as most other games that do. It seems as though there was a polygon shortage around the time of this game's development, as everything has a real flat look to it. Gauntlet Legends tried to take the birds-eye-view concept of the original and transfer it into a 3D environment, but this simply doesn't work, and you end up playing essentially the same old game with prettier looking backgrounds. Even though  my character was now climbing volcanic mountains, exploring temples, and trekking through the East, I still would have preferred the basic, randomly generated 2D dungeon. Maybe there was just something special about the carbon-copy levels contained in the original that made Gauntlet so enjoyable. (Or maybe it was because I was twelve. Who knows?) <P>The gameplay hasn't changed. You're still meandering about, opening doors, collecting treasure, and killing everything around you. And, just as in the arcade version, you don't even have to hit the attack button if you don't want to - it'll automatically strike enemies for you when you get close. This makes the game extremely one-hand friendly, and it takes the challenge of out playing. Although there's a new money system that lets you buy power-ups, I found that I was instead collecting power-ups and selling them just to buy my health back. And on the audio front, you'll be sick of the God-like voice that reads all the obvious game hints for you by the second level. In fact, there's really nothing great about the sound in the game. The music is mediocre at best, and the sound effects are repetitive.  <P>Gauntlet Legends boils down to another top-down fantasy button masher. There's nothing innovative here, and the game is neither enthralling nor interesting. There's no real motivation to complete the game, and the reward you receive once you do makes you regret the time you had invested in the game.

Star Ocean: The Second Story,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Includes original artwork and case as well as manual.', ""Star Ocean: The Second Story is the 32-bit follow-up to Enix's original Super Famicom title, Star Ocean, a game that was released in the dying days of the system and did not receive the success it was due. A departure from the first game, Second Story, like most RPGs, offers you a fresh set of characters to play as. At the start of the game you select one of two characters: Crawd or Rena, and where the story begins depends on whom you choose. Your choice only affects the direction of the storyline, since the two of you ultimately meet up anyway and progress together through the game. As the story advances, you'll meet up with other key characters, whom you can also add to your party. Marking Enix's first major RPG undertaking in the next-generation wars, Star Ocean: Second Story is a decidedly conservative attempt to refine rather than reinvent, and it shows.  <P>Second Story is 16-bit in nature but 32-bit in execution and is a conservative step forward in RPG gaming, coming across like a combination of Grandia and Saga Frontier. The backgrounds in the game are prerendered, like Saga Frontier, while the characters are sprite-based. Unlike in Saga Frontier, the citizens of Star Ocean blend well with their environments. Little touches like seeing your reflection on smooth surfaces like water, or seeing your characters darken whenever they walk through a shady area are very cool. Other details, like birds flying across the screen, are also very realistic and must be seen to be fully appreciated. Although tri-Ace is the developer responsible for the creation of Star Ocean: SS, it should be noted that the company was assisted in this project by Japanese CG house Links. Links may not sound familiar, but its works speak for itself. The company was responsible for much of the CG rendering in Final Fantasy VII and for creating the CG intros in all three Shining Force III games. Links' assistance is evident in Star Ocean's gorgeous opening movie, as well in the prerendered backgrounds which are easily on a par with FFVII and Parasite Eve. Although the game plays like an old-school RPG, it certainly doesn't look like one. <P>Battle scenes, on the other hand, switch to a fully polygonal backdrop, like Grandia, while the sprite-based characters duke it out in real time, which leads us to the next interesting feature of Star Ocean, and that's the battle engine. Depending on your familiarity with the Star Ocean battle system, you can choose from one of three settings during combat: standard, semi-active or full-active. Standard is for those who are new to the series, since the battles are fairly fast paced, while semi-active and full-active are for gamers who want more control over every aspect of the battles. In any case, as in the original, fights are fast paced and have an almost action-game feel to them. <P>During battle scenes, you can choose special attacks, which are learned during the course of the game. Once you have multiple characters in your party (which can number up to eight, with four on the battlefield), you can combine specials to create a super-specialty. Other features in the game include item creation, skill learning (after learning an appropriate amount of skills, you can combine them to acquire more-powerful specialties, and more. <P>Exploration takes you through myriad towns and villages, each of which has its own unique look. The usual suspects appear in great numbers: merchants, weapons shops, restaurants, inns, etc. Once you've filled your inventory with the necessary supplies, your travels will take you onto an overhead 3D-map, much like the one found in FFVII, where you will have to search for hidden caves and well-hidden harbor towns, among others. Spanning two discs, Star Ocean has plenty to see and do. <P>Possessing one of the more incredible soundtracks composed for a video game, Star Ocean's US translation is functional, although not as clever as some of Working Design's better work. Star Ocean: Second Story is an engaging RPG that ranks up there with the likes of Xenogears and Suikoden, with the storyline leading you on an incredible journey that's not as flashy as some, but certainly more substantial than others. With at least 50 hours of gaming in each character's scenario, Star Ocean might not be compelling enough to play through twice, but the first time is as engaging as any RPG you're likely to play. Highly recommended in any case. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

MechWarrior 3 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Prepare to walk the walk, MechWarrior.', ""The Inner Sphere's long-awaited counterattack against the vicious Clan Smoke Jaguar rages on, but the enemy isn't willing to lie down and die. On a world with the ironic name of Tranquil, one of the last ranking Smoke Jaguar star colonels is preparing a bastion for his clan to lick its wounds and prepare its vengeance. Your mission: conduct a high-impact commando raid on Tranquil and destroy its usefulness as a base of operations before the enemy has a chance to dig in.<P>The tricky part is, MechWarrior, that the Jaguars know they're beaten and, honorable or not, they're going to try everything to see that they get their shot at vengeance against the Inner Sphere. You can bet they're going to start with the closest target--you."", ""The greatest feat a science-fiction combat simulation can achieve is to suspend your disbelief for moments or stretches of time and to actually convince you in those instants that you're piloting some sort of incredible military machine. Activision's MechWarrior 2 achieved this feat back in 1995. It was one of the pioneers of high-resolution 3D graphics, and beyond that, it was an excellent futuristic combat simulation. Since the MechWarrior series is, for better or for worse, confined to the rules of its source material, FASA's pen-and-paper tactical combat game, the real goal of Zipper Interactive's game is to update its predecessor with state-of-the-art graphics while retaining the action and simulation elements intact. And MechWarrior 3 accomplishes this goal gracefully, even as it tactfully deviates from certain traditions laid down by its ancestors to enhance the depth and complexity of the game. It might seem rough around the edges once in a while, but nevertheless, MechWarrior 3 is a worthy successor to one of the best games of the decade. Of course graphics aren't everything, but it doesn't hurt when a game looks as good as this. The attention to detail is what's especially impressive - although all the different mechs in the game look great, it's the way they move that makes them seem so real. You can see their toes flex, and they leave tracks in the earth and kick up clouds of dust and dirt with each and every step. They topple over slowly and painfully if they lose balance from a powerful attack, and struggle back to a standing position. As they're shot apart in battle, their limbs don't just fall off but rather rip from their sockets, leaving exposed pipes and cables where the arm or leg used to be. Their weapons fire independently and look powerful and are easily distinguishable on the battlefield. Laser weapons pierce their target instantly, while pulse lasers generate a steady stream of concentrated energy. Autocannons are so powerful that your mech recoils as it lets loose each hail of bullets, while your missiles fill the screen with their contrails. Certainly lasers, machine guns, and missiles aren't anything unusual for a science-fiction game, but in MechWarrior 3, these archetypal weapons are in top form, not only because they look great, but also because they are finely balanced with proportional strengths and weaknesses. As they fight, the BattleMechs look right at home in the beautiful, desolate terrain of the aptly named planet Tranquil. Though the hills might look a little blocky sometimes, everything else, like thunderstorms, beaches, ravines, and deserted cityscapes, looks realistic and detailed. You can even see rays of sunlight pierce through the overcast sky, while explosive weapons leave huge craters in the ground. Other special effects, like the fires caused by internal explosions in damaged mechs, as well as the deadly blue swirl of the particle projection cannon, look as good as just about everything else in the game. All the while, the 3D cockpit shudders with every step and every shot. MechWarrior 3's great sound effects make the game feel even more true to life, as each step is accompanied by a resounding, dull thud that perfectly conveys the awesome scale of the machine under your control. Weapons and explosions also sound good, although most of the speech in the game, including your onboard computer and assorted banter between rival MechWarriors, isn't anything especially exciting. The game's soundtrack, while suitably grandiose and serious-sounding, is also a bit of a disappointment after MechWarrior 2 and comes across as a pale imitation of its predecessor's striking orchestral score. But you won't be worried about the music once you're in the game, trying to fend off enemy mechs as well as tanks and stationary defenses. MechWarrior 3 plays similarly to its predecessor by forcing you to compensate for your machine's sluggishness with precision piloting and for its propensity to overheat with deadly aim. Mechs can twist at the torso, but you can also aim and fire easily at any point onscreen by using the mouse. One important new feature lets you magnify the area around your targeting reticle, so that you can strike a target from a much longer range than your eyes can see. Another new trick that works along with this one lets you lock onto specific parts of the enemy mech, so that you can try to disable key weapons systems or internal components. But pinpoint accuracy isn't quite so important if you decide to use an alpha strike, which unloads every weapon on your mech simultaneously. This devastating attack will overheat your mech more often than not, and overheating causes your sensors to malfunction and may cause your mech to shut down or even explode. But fortunately for you, MechWarrior 3 also introduces a coolant flush device that can be used a limited number of times to rapidly dissipate your machine's heat. Together, these abilities make MechWarrior 3 battles tense and exciting, since a quick decision can just as quickly determine the outcome. Most missions also put you in charge of a trio of vehicles that form your mobile field base, which is essentially a pit crew that can be ordered to reload and repair your mech on the battlefield. Although the MFB will try to stay out of the action, it can be destroyed if you aren't careful. So while the MFB is your lifeline, even as it renders the especially powerful BattleTech weapons (which hold very little ammunition) far more practical, it's also an all-new liability. Luckily, you usually won't have to fight alone and can order your lancemates to protect the MFB at the touch of a button. Communicating with your team is simple, and friendly pilots do a good job following orders, even as enemy pilots do a good job trying to put an end to you and your allies alike. Enemy mechs maneuver effectively, changing directions often and dodging and weaving to avoid your attacks, and their aim is good but not so perfect that you can't get away from their guns with some fancy footwork of your own. But being quick on your feet won't keep you alive for long, especially if you're up against several enemies at once, as they'll try to take advantage of their superior numbers by flanking and surrounding you. It's too bad, then, that the campaign is a little too straightforward and short for its own good, with only around 20 missions. Though they're linked seamlessly, the missions aren't terribly unique either, and in light of how good the game looks otherwise, it's disappointing that the campaign wasn't quite as bold or impressive as most everything else about MechWarrior 3. You'll probably end up spending a lot of time in the excellent instant-action mode instead, which you can use to easily set up fights against any number of enemies of any size and strength. You can even choose to fight wave after wave or progressively more challenging opponents, as well as pit yourself in base-attack and base-defense missions. Multiplayer MechWarrior 3 is similarly flexible and allows for both deathmatch and team-play battles, with plenty of opponents guaranteed on Microsoft's Gaming Zone. You could nitpick about how MechWarrior 3's mech lab interface is a little convoluted, making it cumbersome to customize your machine; and it's true that the campaign isn't quite as exciting as it might have been. Long-time fans will also lament the absence of some of the most interesting mech chassis types, like the marauder and the rifleman, which have been quietly discontinued because of legal concerns surrounding BattleTech's borrowing too much from the Japanese animation that inspired it. But these concerns aren't so very important once you find that MechWarrior 3 looks, sounds, and controls better than anything else like it. <I>--Greg Kasavin </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Starsiege Tribes (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['This first-person perspective game sets tribe against tribe. Although single players can train and practice alone, the real heart of this game is its multiplayer design. This focus on working as a member of a tribe, together with dynamic graphics and seamless integration between exteriors and interiors, make this game unique.', ""Any time a game is designed strictly for online play, that game's developer is taking a serious risk when bringing the game to market. After all, there are still plenty of gamers who prefer single-player titles. So in order for a multiplayer-only title to be successful, it must provide that elegant combination of great gameplay, painless online connectivity, and speedy performance to ensure its popularity and success. Starsiege: Tribes from Dynamix and Sierra comes awfully close to striking that perfect balance, and, although performance can be a problem, the game manages to provide one of the more memorable and addictive online gaming experiences yet."", ""Set in the universe formerly known as EarthSiege, Tribes is a first-person, squad-based action game in which you take part in team battles against one or more rival clans. Game variants include the obligatory deathmatch mode, along with capture the flag and a slew of other challenging game types: Defend and destroy requires you to guard your base while taking out your enemy's, capture and hold is like CTF except that you must grab and defend specific spots on the map, and find and retrieve is basically a big scavenger hunt with heavy weapons."", ""Gameplay is very similar to multiplayer mode in NovaLogic's Delta Force but with far better visuals and many more options for customizing your weapons loadout. The game features nearly 40 maps, each of which is a wonderfully rendered landscape with rolling hills and plenty of big, open spaces. As in Delta Force, a great deal of combat takes place at extreme ranges, but thanks to the superb 3D graphics engine, you can more easily make out your targets in Tribes."", 'You have the choice of light, medium, or heavy armor, each of which can accommodate a varying set of weapons and equipment. Players in heavy armor, for example, are the only ones who can carry heavy mortars (which are incredibly powerful and good for taking out base defenses from afar). Light-armored players, on the other hand, are the only ones capable of wielding the deadly (and oh so wonderful) sniper rifle in combat.', 'The weapons in Tribes are decent, with a few energy weapons, a slick gun the fires explosive discs, a short-range Gatling gun, and a trusty grenade launcher. The sniper rifle is the only ""instant effect"" gun in the bunch, as each of the other weapons fires a relatively slow projectile. This can make the game\'s long-distance combat rather difficult, as you must aim very carefully and learn to anticipate your target\'s moves - jumping madly into a free-for-all Quake II-style fray is usually a recipe for disaster in Tribes.', ""You can also carry a variety of other equipment, such as gun turrets, which are typically set up to automatically defend your base and your flag, and repair kits, which are always helpful for fixing damaged consoles and energy stations. Different types of consoles allow you to change your armor and weapons configurations, get a quick reload, or summon up a transport aircraft to fly. Like the armor variants, there are three types of aircraft in Tribes: scout, medium, and heavy. The larger craft can carry other players, making them useful for long-range mass attacks. The single-player scout craft, on the other hand, is quite speedy and has the ability to fire explosive rockets. Energy stations keep the aircraft and other types of consoles operational and are the key to survival in Tribes - take out an enemy's energy source, and they will be hard-pressed to mount a viable defense."", 'Once you\'re connected to a server, your results will most certainly vary. I rarely encountered any significant lag at any ""green"" server I joined, but the chat line in every game I played was littered with lag complaints from other players. I saw many players get stuck and drop from the game entirely, as well. On only one server did I have any lockups or dropped connections, and there it seemed to be a problem with that specific server\'s stability.', ""Playing Tribes can be pretty intimidating at first, as the game's meager single-player training missions do little to prepare you for the online carnage of a multiplayer battle. Also, despite the game's team structure, there are still plenty of freelancers in each game, running about with their own agenda and little regard for teamwork or joint objectives. And when a loose group of freelance hotshots runs into a well-organized team, the results are always the same: Complete and utter humiliation for the solo artists."", 'Tribes could stand to be improved in a few areas, notably in the matter of the weapons consoles. Currently, these stations almost always have long lines of players waiting for access. You can urge other players to hurry up with a prerecorded voice command, which rarely has any effect, or take advantage of the game\'s ""favorites"" feature to preset five custom weapons loadouts and speed up your own time at the weapons console. Perhaps if you could begin a mission - and respawn - with one of your favorite loadouts already in place, the console-glut problem would ease up a bit. You would then only have to visit the console for repairs and to change loadouts for a specific purpose (such as picking up a turret for deployment).', ""Also, the game could really benefit from more and better training missions. Firing each gun a few times does little to teach the intricacies of aiming a mortar, for example. And the Terra Nova style keyboard command layout takes quite a bit of getting used to, especially when used in combination with the jetpack (for which the game offers little guidance). One way to handle this deficiency would be to include a skirmish mode, so that you could at least get in a little practice before running smack into a team of seasoned veterans online. You can learn quickly in a multiplayer game, but you can also get wiped out repeatedly without ever getting the chance to see or learn from your opponent - and that's not going to keep new players coming back."", ""Finally, the game really needs to handle scores and statistics a little better. After a mission is completed, you get about ten seconds to call up the scores and see how you and your team fared. Unfortunately, the score window is too small and offers too little information - which is gone in a few seconds anyway, as the game automatically launches a new mission after the previous one is completed. First off, Tribes should present the stats in a larger, easier-to-read window. Secondly, Dynamix really should consider tracking assists or some similar stat. As it stands, the only player who gets credit for a kill is the one who gets in the final shot - never mind the sniper who took the bad guy down to 1-percent health to begin with. Lastly, why not save a player's accumulated stats locally? Kills, games won, flags captured: It may be a team game, but I kind of like to know when I've killed my 100th victim online."", ""In light of the game's outstanding gameplay, however, each of these criticisms is a minor point at best. Looking at the game as a whole, there's no denying that Starsiege: Tribes is an ambitious game that successfully delivers a rich and addictive multiplayer gaming experience. Any team-minded action fan will love this game, and I suspect that more than a few freelance types will also."", ""[Editor's Note: In the original version of this review, it was stated that specific ping values for Tribes servers were not provided.

Thus begins a journey that includes 10 designs and 350 puzzles. It's up to you to solve them, capture the tricksters, and save the world from chaos. Solve 3-D puzzles specially designed for the computer. The puzzles don't require a lot of time to learn, yet they are progressively challenging to master. An overall mission provides a purpose for completing the puzzles. Game-play options allow you to follow the game's story line or jump directly to your favorite puzzle."", 'Alexei Pajitnov\'s name will forever be linked to Tetris, arguably the best puzzle game of all time. Luckily, the accomplishment of designing what is probably the most addictive game ever overshadows his recent track record, which includes mediocre selections such as Microsoft Puzzle Collection and a string of mediocre games for MicroProse, including Knight Moves and Qwirks, a poor PC adaptation of the excellent Puyo Puyo. <P>Pajitnov\'s latest, Pandora\'s Box, is a welcome return to form. While not quite as mind-and-finger-numbingly addictive as the game he is famous for, it still makes for a fun diversion. <P>Pandora\'s Box isn\'t actually a single game, but rather a collection of ten different puzzle types. For the most part, each type is a variation on the jigsaw puzzle, and some are more fun than others. In each puzzle, you must arrange the pieces to complete a picture or an object. What the pieces are, and what you need to do to arrange them properly, differs from puzzle to puzzle. <P>The puzzle types themselves range from renovated versions of old favorites, such as Rotoscope, a circular slider puzzle, to innovative variations like Outer Layer, which requires you to place the textures on a 3D object such as a vase or a sculpture. Other puzzles types are a bit more typical. Overlap is a straightforward jigsaw puzzle; the only difference is that the pieces can, as the name suggests, overlap. Slices is simply a vertical jigsaw puzzle that requires you to stack pieces of a 3D object. And Focus Point, the best of the lot, requires you to assemble out-of-focus pieces of an image. <P>There are also two puzzle types that stray from the jigsaw formula. Image Hole, probably the least interesting puzzle in the game, involves a covered picture. Shapes move around the board, revealing the image as they pass over. Your goal is to line up the shape with its corresponding portion of the picture underneath. It sounds interesting, but the shapes are too vague to make it anything more than frustrating most of the time. The other non-jigsaw puzzle is Find and Fill. In this puzzle, you are presented with a picture with sections missing and a separate jumble of shapes. You must use a simple paint program to find and fill the shapes that are missing from the picture. It\'s fun, but the picture that\'s provided for reference is so tiny the puzzle often ends up being nothing more than a guessing game. <P>What makes Pandora\'s Box more interesting than just a puzzle anthology is its attempt to give meaning to the proceedings. The story follows the basics of the Greek myth from which the game takes its name. Pandora has unleashed chaos - in the form of seven trickster gods - into the world, and you must recapture them. To do this, you must solve puzzles. What\'s intriguing is that the jigsaw nature of the puzzles fits the theme somewhat - you must restore order to chaos by piecing together fragments of puzzles into a whole - and your overall sense of purpose, even if it\'s the most basic ""find the stuff"" premise, is rare for the genre. <P>You must capture the seven tricksters: mythological and religious figures such as Eris, Puck, and Coyote. You pursue each of them to several cities, each of which has ten puzzles. Under one of the puzzles is a piece of the box. There are four pieces associated with each of these mischievous spirits, and once you have obtained all four pieces from one, you then go after the trickster himself. Once you\'ve captured him, you move on to the next trickster, the next set of cities, and the next set of puzzles. There\'s a lot to do and a lot of puzzles to solve. The escalating difficulty and the slow introduction of new puzzle types help to keep things interesting. <P>Pandora\'s Box isn\'t the Half-Life of puzzle games, but it is revolutionary in a sense. It\'s not only a great way to divert yourself for short periods of time, but the overall sense of accomplishment you\'ll feel when you complete a series of its puzzles makes it something you\'ll go back to time and time again. And while the individual pieces may be a bit weak on their own, the overall experience is satisfying and worthwhile.<I>--Ron Dulin</I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Microsoft Pinball Arcade - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""You'll flip more than seven classic pinball machines that look, sound, and play like the real thing. Go for the high score on one groundbreaking table from each decade--from the 1930s to the present. The widest variety of tables, realistic ball physics, and striking graphics all add up to wickedly fast action for current and prospective pinball wizards."", 'Microsoft has done a fairly good job recently of reviving games for their nostalgia value. The Revenge of Arcade and Return of Arcade collections brought back classic \'80s arcade games from a different era when video games first began to reveal the possibilities of electronic gaming. Before that, relatively low-tech pinball tables ruled the arcade floors, and now, Microsoft has turned the clock back even further to explore the unsought realm of historical pinball simulation. Because of Microsoft\'s decision to limit itself to one pinball company, Microsoft Pinball Arcade comes off as more of an interactive history lesson than a collection of good games. <P> Microsoft Pinball Arcade attempts to simulate seven pinball games from manufacturer Gottlieb, the first being from 1931 when David Gottlieb designed the ""first"" pinball game called Baffle Ball. The rest of the tables are from the succeeding decades, showcasing innovations in design and play. Included in this collection are Baffle Ball (1931), Humpty Dumpty (1947), Knock Out (1950), Slick Chick (1963), Spirit of 76 (1976), Haunted House (1982), and Cue Ball Wizard (1992). <P> The available variations in design guarantee that each table plays remarkably different from any other. In pinball, you\'re basically playing ""against"" the design of the table so that the goal is to overcome the obstacles with a limited number of control factors (flippers, nudging, and plunger). The layout of the varied tables requires a good bit of thinking while playing to make sure you nudge or flip at exactly the right moment. To help you through all this, Microsoft\'s in-game documentation is an excellent reference source for understanding how pinball strategy works (how to flip and ""catch"" the ball) as well as giving complete layouts of the tables with descriptions of all the scoring elements within the games themselves. This resource is a godsend for novices who usually just pound the flippers in hopes of getting big points. <P> However, what the variations in table design don\'t provide is an assortment of the ""best of the best"" that pinball has to offer. Sure the tables are old and give you a great sense of how far pinball has come, but with all the money Microsoft has, couldn\'t it spare a few more bucks to include great tables from manufacturers Williams and Bally? The result is a collection of tables that range from confusing designs such as Humpty Dumpty (with no bottom flippers, only outward-angled side flippers) to a classic such as Spirit of 76, which is almost a picturesque version of pinball from its golden years. <P> The one game element that really draws you in is the faithful reproduction of the sounds from all the tables. Anything from a ball hitting a steel pin to the distinct sound of a bumper will make you sit up and notice this game amongst the myriad pinball titles out there. Even when the table design is frustrating, you\'re going to find yourself aching to get the next bonus table feature just so you can hear some classic bell sounds you haven\'t experienced yet. <P> What also elevates this game\'s style to above average is the faithful rendering of the back-glass scoring system from each table. The newer tables such as Haunted House and Cue Ball Wizard use electronic font displays to show your score, while the older tables use lighted signs such as ""2 million"" in combination with rolling dials akin to automobile odometers. The producers of the game even went so far as to make you wait for the dials to roll/reset to zero before you could play another game. <P> If you\'re eager to learn pinball, Microsoft Pinball Arcade is a great history lesson, as well as a good way to learn table navigation and scoring techniques. If you\'re just looking for a solid pinball game to pass the time, there are other games out there with more graphically entrancing features and more modern sounds. But, if you\'re an elite pinball player looking for the only game that will let you go back in time for a gem such as Slick Chick, this is the only game for you. Microsoft has done a good job recreating the past, but when it comes down to gameplay, you might wonder if other tables from the past would have been more worthy of recreation. <i>--Tahsin Shamma</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Lords of the Realm: Royal Collection,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['For <i>Lords of the Realm II</i> fans, Sierra announces more excitement, new combat, plus head-to-head combat on the Internet with other <i>Lords of the Realm II</i> fans. The <i>Lords of the Realm: Royal Collection</i> offers you everything you need. Get the original <i>Lords of the Realm</i> together with <i>Lords of the Realm II</i> and the Internet-ready <i>Lords of the Realm II Siege Pack</i> in the <i>Royal Collection</i>.', 'Forget about chivalrous kings and courtly honor: The Middle Ages sucked. If you didn\'t come down with a severe case of the Black Death in those days, then your poor, starving, plague-ridden village was being ransacked by some neighboring tyrant. Sierra tries to capture the bleak reality of the bloody feudal struggles during these so-called ""dark ages"" in their recent turn-based/real-time strategy title Lords of the Realm II. Devout fans of strategy greats hoped that this would combine the best of both Warcraft II and Civilization II, and while it falls just short of being that ultimate game, Lords II still provides a challenging and entertaining experience for strategy enthusiasts. And challenging it is: The Middle Ages were tough times and similarly, Lords of the Realm II is a tough game.', 'The premise of Lords of the Realm II: The king has been axed, and you, along with other feudal lords, are vying to capture neighboring fiefdoms and gain rule over the land. The majority of the game takes place in a three-quarter perspective (like Civilization II), showing your village, surrounding industries (like mining, weapons production, woodcutting, and agriculture), and traders, who travel in and out of your territory periodically. The first part of a typical campaign is normally spent carefully managing agricultural resources and adjusting tax rates to foster more peasant growth and build up a decent economy. After a few seasons (each turn advances you a season) when industrial growth becomes more of a concern, you can simply adjust a slider that controls your farming vs. industry priority. This all sounds pretty straightforward in ink (or electrons, whatever), but your peasants are fairly temperamental. They get ticked off by things like slight tax increases, food shortages, over-conscripting, and being overworked. A ""happiness"" figure located on the toolbar indicates the status of your village, and if your villagers aren\'t feeling hunky-dory about the way you\'re governing, they\'ll revolt at the drop of a hat.', 'Once you have a decent number of (happy) peasants, you can start conscripting them to build up armies. Different soldier classes - peasants, knights, archers, pikemen, and mercenaries - all become available depending on the storehouse of weapons you possess. At some point, you have to deal with the other power-hungry lords. These guys are real cocky bastards, and their continual, snotty provocations just make you want to ""get medieval"" on them all the more. Guide your troops over to meet an opposing lord\'s army or allow him to try to attack a garrisoned castle, and the screen automatically switches to real-time combat mode. Music gets a little more dramatic and, as happens in Warcraft, you select troops, point and click on enemies, and the chain mail flies. If you\'re defending a castle, you can be really cruel, dumping sizzling oil on enemies and perforating them with arrows while they try to break through your castle walls with siege towers, catapults, and battering rams.', ""I'll have to admit, it's pretty exciting to defend a besieged castle. But on the whole, the real-time combat in Lords of the Realm II could have been improved greatly. Your men are frustratingly difficult to maneuver, stumbling around at times as though they'd just had a frontal lobotomy. Also, just like a field of pre-adolescent soccer players, the combat field gets a little too crowded too easily."", ""Although the economic model of Lords I has been simplified to incorporate these action elements, it still adds a new spin to and makes more challenging a title which, for the most part, would have just been a resource management game. Some die-hard war strategy gamers may find that the new style of Lords II is too compromising and that the game spreads itself thin by trying to accomplish too much. But if you're looking for a new Civ-style strategy game that adds a new dimension to its gameplay, you may want to give Lords of the Realm II a try. <i>--Tim Soete</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Sierra Sports: Grand Prix Legends - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<i>Grand Prix Legends</i> is a racing simulation based on the drivers, teams, tracks, and cars of the 1967 Grand Prix Season--a season known as the most dangerous in racing history. The game features fast unstable cars, historical racetracks, and some of the world's most famous drivers."", 'How real is real enough - or, in the case of Grand Prix Legends, how real is too real? <P> Those are questions some gamers will be asking themselves after wrestling to complete a single lap - without spinning out or crashing, that is - on any of the eleven world-famous tracks featured in Grand Prix Legends, Papyrus\' newest racing sim that\'s being rightly hailed as the most realistic simulation ever developed. <P> Grand Prix Legends is a nearly perfect re-creation of the 1967 Grand Prix season, with Watkins Glen, Monza, Spa-Francorchamps, Rouen-les-Essarts, Mosport, Silverstone, Kyalami, Zandvoort, Mexico City, Monte Carlo, and the mighty Nurburgring modeled in the sim; only Le Mans is missing, and only two teams (Cooper and Honda) are missing from that year. <P> In addition to five historically accurate cars - the Lotus-Ford 49, the Repco-Brabham BT24, the Eagle-Weslake T1G, the Ferrari 312, and the BRM H-16 - Papyrus has also included two fantasy cars, the Murasama and the Coventry (obviously meant to take the places of Honda and Cooper, respectively). And of course there are the drivers: Gurney, Clark, Hill, McLaren, and many others who literally put their lives on the line in pursuit of victory and to slake their thirst for raw power and speed. <P> It might sound like a tired cliche, but each of these cars really does have its own distinct characteristics, and if you don\'t believe me, then try driving the Murasama after you\'ve gotten used to the Lotus or the Ferrari. They all, however, share a common trait: They\'re incredibly hard to drive. That shouldn\'t come as any big surprise; put a novice in a lightweight car with a 400-plus horsepower engine and no type of aerodynamic additions like spoilers or wings to provide down force, and it\'s only natural he\'ll find himself flipping, spinning, rolling, and generally doing everything except staying upright and heading around the track. Even after heading to the pits over and over again to tweak the almost innumerable settings for suspension, fuel, tires, and so on, you\'re likely to still find it hard to handle these beasts - at least if you want to keep up with the rest of the pack. <P> It\'s not as though Papyrus tried to pull the wool over anyone\'s eyes regarding the game\'s difficulty level and steep learning curve. On the second page of the manual - not to be confused with the nearly 100-page strategy guide bundled with the game, without which the learning curve might become vertical - you\'ll find this statement: ""You will spin and crash because everyone who tries the simulation spins and crashes the first time out. And the second time out. And the third. People who have raced real cars spin and crash in the simulator - mainly because they aren\'t feeling the forces they are used to feeling while driving."" <P> And it\'s that last little bit that leads me to my only serious complaint against an otherwise stunning achievement: Why didn\'t Papyrus attempt to ease the learning curve with a few realism toggles? These cars are incredibly difficult to drive when you are getting real-world feedback, and they become absolute bears when you don\'t have any input except what you see on a computer monitor and hear through some speakers. <P> How about a toggle for a traction meter that would give some idea of how close you are to spinning out? Or an option to put a ""governor"" on the top speed of the computer-controlled drivers so you could race with the physics model fully active and at least be competitive as you gradually mastered the sim? It\'s true that there are driving aids for shifting, throttle, and braking, but these are little more than crutches that slow you down more than teach you how to handle the toughest driving sim ever created. Instead, it\'d be far better to have an option to make the opponents a little dumber and a little slower so you could first learn how to race and then work on speed. I know, I know - you can get your chops down in the game\'s training mode. But that doesn\'t change the fact that GPL might lure more people in if at least some of them could find a way to be competitive from the green flag. <P> And I really want more people to get into this sim, because once it casts its spell on you - even if that takes 10 or 15 hours - you\'re likely to be hooked for a long, long time to come. I know, because I was just about to throw up my hands and walk away when I actually finished in the top ten (in a field of 20) at Monza - and I felt so happy and proud that it was almost like an early Christmas present. Yes, Monza\'s one of the easiest tracks, and I had the race length set to novice. But that one little taste of success was enough to have me eager to climb back in the Lotus and set my sights on even tougher challenges. <P> What makes GPL even more entrancing is the wonderful graphical flourishes - the bystanders, the animated officials, accurate mirrors (mind blowing the first time you see them), and drivers shifting down and turning the wheel as they enter turns. The instant replay feature gets a near-perfect score, as do the outstanding artificial intelligence routines developed for the drivers. Tracks and background scenery are first-rate in 3D-accelerated mode (more on that later), but you won\'t fully appreciate how well they\'re done until you\'re able to sit back and watch the drama unfold on replay. <P> About the only quibble I have with gameplay is the limited number of views: Like Papyrus\' previous IndyCar Racing and NASCAR Racing games, GPL has only two views (cockpit and chase) available during the race, but about ten during the replay. I\'m certainly not going to race from the nose view, but I\'d like to access the roll-bar view because it gives you greater viewing distance down the track (another potential way of balancing the hyperrealistic physics model). As it stands, the only way to access anything besides the two standard views is to edit the PLAYER.INI file - and if you hit F10 to access the chase view, then it wipes out the changes and sticks you back in the cockpit. <P> A lot of racing fans have raved about the game\'s multiplayer action even over the Internet, but Papyrus and Sierra have come up a little short of the mark by failing to provide even a rudimentary chat area where GPL owners can meet and arrange matches. There are a couple of web sites that provide such a feature, and of course you can always check out the #gpl channel on IRQ or head to Kali to look for opponents. But just as with the game\'s learning curve, these are things we veterans take for granted but which are likely to be off-putting for newbies or casual gamers. <P> Besides plenty of patience, you\'ll also need one other thing to fully enjoy GPL: a fairly high-end system with a good control setup. Papyrus recommends a 266MHz with 64MB RAM and a 3D card using either the 3dfx or Rendition chipset (strangely, there\'s no Direct3D support), but I suspect that you\'ll need a 300MHz to run at 800x600 in 16-bit color against a full field of opponents. As far as controllers go, the Microsoft Force Feedback Wheel worked like a charm even though the game doesn\'t have force-feedback support, but I also got nice results with a pedal/wheel combo as well. <P> Grand Prix Legends isn\'t for everyone, but that little adage is true of many of the finer things in life. Provided you\'ve got enough computing muscle to run it smoothly and the patience to stay with it long past the first feelings of frustration, Grand Prix Legends will reward you with arguably the most intense racing experience ever seen on a personal computer. <i>--Stephen Poole</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Homeworld - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>Homeworld</i> is the next evolution of real-time strategy gaming, delivering a fresh experience in a totally 3-D universe. It gives players freedom to create new styles of play while delivering cinema-quality graphics, special effects, vividly rendered ships, and an innovative interface.', 'Relic\'s Homeworld is the sort of game that can inspire unbridled hyperbole in game reviewers. With its stunning 3D engine, uniquely challenging gameplay in both single- and multiplayer modes, great audio, and terrific story, Homeworld is both an excellent game and one that may well reshape the entire real-time strategy genre. <P> It begins with an epic discovery: An ancient starship, buried deep beneath the sands of your home planet Kharak, contains evidence indicating that your people descended from aliens who colonized the planet many centuries ago. Spurred on by this discovery, your people construct a massive mothership with hyperspace capabilities and undertake an expedition to find their true homeworld. However, you complete your first hyperspace jump only to run smack into a swarm of hostile aliens, which proceed to reduce Kharak to a burning wasteland. Now, with only the mothership to call home, you must lead the fleet onward to your fabled homeworld, exacting vengeance for Kharak along the way. <P> Most of the plot unfolds by way of elaborate cutscenes created using the game\'s 3D engine. The game also makes use of some slick hand-drawn animation to convey other elements of the story. These black-and-white scenes have a simple but gritty look to them, and they work exceptionally well with the flashy 3D cinematics. <P> Homeworld\'s gameplay is in fact fairly similar to any tried-and-true real-time strategy game. You have a fleet under your command and must guide it through a series of 16 missions by building more vessels, researching new technologies, and harvesting resources from asteroids and dust clouds. <P> However, in spite of the basic formula, Homeworld manages to feel like a very different breed of game. Your ships and resources carry over from mission to mission. This can result in very different playing habits designed to preserve your precious fleet. After all, it\'s the only one you have. For example, you\'ll come to rely on vessels like the support frigate to repair your damaged ships so they are ready for the next mission. Similarly, you might find yourself sticking around after completing your mission goals to harvest every last ounce of space dust available. Thankfully, Homeworld lets you do this sort of thing, because you control when you exit each mission regardless of when and how the mission goals are accomplished. <P> But the most obvious difference between this and other real-time strategy games is the true 3D nature of the gameworld. You\'re in deep space, after all, so there is no restriction on the direction in which your units may travel. As a result, you\'ll have to learn to think and move using three axes at all times. This can be extremely confusing if you jump right in, which is why you ought to go through Homeworld\'s excellent tutorial regardless of your experience with real-time strategy games. One thing the tutorial doesn\'t teach you is the best way to keep track of your units once a battle begins. Though you have numerous options for organizing your ships - including a variety of formations and three different attack styles - it can be quite easy to scatter them across the galactic map if you\'re not careful. The main culprit here is the convoluted 3D movement command. In order to move your ships along the Z-axis, you must first click on an X-Y destination, then hold the shift key and move the mouse to indicate the distance up or down that you wish your ships to travel. Be warned that this system can be incredibly difficult to master, especially if you don\'t take the time to line things up perfectly. <P> Fortunately, you won\'t mind retrying some of Homeworld\'s missions a few times until you get them right, because you never get the sense that the computer is cheating you. These missions are challenging, especially towards the end of the campaign, but they are fair. Even so, you may be put off by the complete lack of a difficulty setting. <P> You\'ll also enjoy playing Homeworld repeatedly because it has some of the most impressive graphics ever. This 3D engine is stunning, with an acute attention to detail that is staggering. Every ship, from the tiny scout fighter to the lumbering heavy cruiser, is amazingly detailed, right down to markings on the hull and individually animated gun turrets. One of the coolest features in the game is the ability to zoom right in on a single ship and follow it through a battle - every turn, maneuver, and shot fired is brought to life, and you get a front-row seat for all of it. <P> The ship design itself is also pretty impressive. And though the two sides in the conflict have nearly identical arsenals (there are only two unique ship classes per side), each has a completely different stylistic approach that is consistent throughout the fleet. Weapons effects are suitably spectacular, and explosions are also very cool, especially when the doomed vessel is penetrated by a beam weapon as it blows up - an effect that recalls those great ship explosions from the old Star Blazers cartoons. <P> The audio in Homeworld is just as impressive as the graphics engine. The new-age musical score may not appeal to everyone, but it does a great job of setting the whole ""space is really, really big"" mood. The unit acknowledgments and sound effects are equally good, though it can be difficult to determine which of your units is asking for more fuel when the call comes in during a heated battle. <P> Homeworld\'s multiplayer support is excellent. The game lets up to eight players compete over the Internet via WON.net. LAN play is also provided, with both IPX and IP networks supported. In multiplayer matches, you can fully customize the game settings, including the presence, skill level, and hostile tendencies of any AI opponents. A skirmish mode is also included if you only wish to play against computer opponents. Resource availability can be modified, and harvesting can even be deactivated completely. The alternative is a periodic infusion of resources for all players. Regrettably, some players have experienced random drops and crashes during online play, and the game tends to really slow down or shut down completely if you throw too many ships into the mix. <P> Homeworld does have a few other issues that deserve mention. There is no way to tell how much damage an enemy ship has sustained. Even though your own ships have clearly visible health bars, the status of enemy ships remains unknown until just before they explode, at which point they begin to smoke and burn. And while you can play the game as either of the two warring parties, the single-player campaign is exactly the same for each side. It seems like Relic really dropped the ball here, since even a perfectly parallel campaign would have been a welcome diversion - and a way to extend the life of the meager single-player game. In fact, an opposing story with an equally positive spin on the conflict would have been downright cool. <P> Even so, any complaints about the basic design or mechanics of Homeworld are minor at best. This is one of the best games you\'ll see this year: The phenomenal 3D engine, the great story, and the stellar gameplay all combine seamlessly in what will surely become a longtime favorite for many gamers. <P> [Editor\'s note: The review originally stated that it is impossible for you to identify enemy ships, which is incorrect.

The villagers are the basic laborers, and the town center enables you to build more of them and expand your settlement. The villagers are central to AOE: they gather resources, build structures, and repair units and buildings. Resources come in four forms: wood, food, stone, and gold. A certain amount of each is consumed to build various units and buildings, research new technology, and advance a civ to the next age.', 'There is no complex resource management or intricate economic model at work here. What you have is the same old real-time resource-gathering in period garb, with four resources instead of one or two. As your civ advances, you develop greater needs for these resources, but the way in which they are gathered and used becomes only marginally more complex (certain research can cause faster harvesting or more production). It appears on the surface to be a complex evocation of the way early civs gathered and used materials, but beneath the hood is the same old ""mine tiberium, buy more stuff than the other guys"" model. It is the first hint that AOE is a simple combat game rather than a glorious empire-builder.', ""There's no denying the thrill the first time a villager chucks a spear at an antelope and spends several minutes hacking meat from its flank with a stone tool. This is the level of detail that brings an empire-building game to life. If only those villagers would grow and develop over the course of the game, it would make it so much more interesting. If only they would trade in their loincloths for some britches and maybe some orange camouflage, and switch from spears to arrows and rifles. Yes, that's another game, but it could easily have been done in AOE, and why it wasn't is a mystery."", ""The problem is that while enemy AI is savvy and aggressive (it can afford to be since it appears to cheat with resources), your units are bone-stupid. Path-finding is appallingly botched, with units easily getting lost or stuck. There is a waypoint system, but that hardly makes up for the fact that your units have trouble moving from point A to point B if you don't utilize it. Military units will stand idly by while someone a millimeter away is hacked to pieces. They respond not at all to enemy incursion in a village and wander aimlessly in the midst of battle. Was this deliberate so that the gamer needed to spend more time in unit management? If so, it was a poor idea, since there is simply too much going on midgame to worry about whether your military is allowing itself to be butchered in one corner of the map while you are aggressively tending to a battle in another portion."", ""AOE obviously is sticking close to an early-empire motif, and there's nothing at all wrong with that. Stone, Tool, Bronze, and Iron are the four ages, and with each come new structures and military units. You don't earn these advanced ages - you buy them with resources. Advancement is a simple matter of hoarding and spending food and gold. The overall welfare of your state is irrelevant as long as it survives: happiness is not measured, trade is barely modeled, and the state exists merely to produce a military machine to crush everyone else on the map. Naval power has a woefully unbalancing effect upon gameplay, with a strong navy able to shred the competition at the expense of reality."", 'Micromanagement is the name of the game in AOE. There is no unit queue, and to build five villagers, you need to build one, wait, build another, and so on. With units acting so stupidly, you should be able to set their level of aggression and the manner in which they attack (a la Dark Reign), but that is also not an option. Diplomacy is relegated to tribute and nothing more, and alliances are hard to form. You can be allied, neutral, or at war with other civs, but if the radio button is still set to ""allied"" when an opponent starts firing on your units, your units will not fire back, defend themselves, or even flee. They will just be destroyed. Cues as to exactly what\'s happening on the map are obscure; the duty has been relegated to unrelated sound effects. Does that bugle call mean my building is finished being built, or my units are under attack? How about some help, people? Victory conditions can also be irritating. There are several campaigns that require that specific goals be met, and these quickly grow tiresome. Thankfully, there is an excellent custom generator that lets you set map size, starting tech, resources, and other features. This is the saving grace of AOE, and what kept me coming back again and again. The main reason is that it let me change some of the insane default victory requirements, such as when the victor is the first to build a ""wonder"" (through another massive consumption of resources) that stands for 2000 years. These 2000 years can pass in about twenty minutes of game time. That means that as soon as an opponent builds a wonder, you create a whacking huge navy to go over and blow it up. Not a very subtle way to maintain an empire. In fact, there is no strategic nuance: It is merely a brawny muscle contest.', ""If all these judgments seem harsh, it is only because Age of Empires looked, and pretends, to be so very much more. It still has tons of potential and a fundamental gameplay that remains entertaining enough to overcome the flaws and merit a fair rating. The system can go very far with some fine-tuning, but as it stands it seems downright schizo. Is it a simplified Civilization or a modestly beefed up Warcraft? It's almost as if the designers started out to create one game and ended up with another. With such beautiful production and the fundamentals of a vastly entertaining game, it's sad that it fell short of the mark. The disappointment is not merely with what AOE is, but with what it failed to be. <i>--T. Liam McDonald</i> <br /><i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Red Baron 3-D - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The realistic graphics and effects of this game take you back to the early days of aviation, when daring pilots flew their dogfight missions on one part courage and one part technology. <i>Red Baron 3-D</i> excels in its attention to detail and use of innovative graphics technology. The game is suitable for all ages.', 'Few things are more disappointing than a sequel that doesn\'t live up to its predecessor. You\'re looking for another Jurassic Park and you end up with The Lost World (or Trespasser, for that matter). Such was the case with Red Baron II, last year\'s sequel to 1990\'s hit World War I sim. Its promising dynamic campaign environment was hobbled by poor graphics performance, nonfunctional multiplayer modes, crippled flight models, and more bugs than a North Carolina picnic. <P> To its credit, Sierra\'s Dynamix division didn\'t take its money and run, promising to do better next time, but rather spent the last year working on a series of patches to bring the program up to speed and add 3D support. The result is Red Baron 3D, a program that\'s a worthy successor to the original. Best of all, Red Baron 3D is available at absolutely no cost to purchasers of Red Baron II. <P> Other than the fixes, the addition of 3D support, and multiplayer enhancements, Red Baron 3D is essentially the same program as last year\'s release. That\'s not a criticism, however, as its feature set more than holds its own against more recent designs. The simulation features 22 different flyable World War I aircraft, along with 18 other types flown by AI pilots. These planes can be flown in a dynamic campaign, on a variety of scripted single missions, and in an instant-action mode. The campaign is especially well done, with more atmosphere and less repetition than the dynamic campaigns found in recent jet sims. You\'re likely to encounter other flights and targets of opportunity - friendly and enemy - en route to and from the target. The missions are better balanced than in the original release. For instance, waypoints don\'t take you over every enemy antiaircraft gun in the country anymore. <P> Flight models have seen dramatic improvement in Red Baron 3D. The original simplified flight model is intact for beginners, but new intermediate and authentic settings will give more experienced sim players a more convincing experience, with features such as torque, spins, gyroscopic effects, and deadly spins. The overall model is very convincing, and it would take quite a bit of test-flying to find the few performance differences between the models and their real-life counterparts. <P> Cockpits have been given an overhaul as well. The virtual cockpit is now as readable as the standard cockpit, making for improved situational awareness while tracking enemies with padlock views. One innovative feature in 3Dfx mode is a toggle to make the cockpit and wings transparent. While this is obviously not realistic (real flight sim fans know it didn\'t come around until Wonder Woman\'s invisible plane was built during World War II), it does make tracking enemies much easier, while still maintaining the ability to use your plane\'s fuselage to keep track of the direction you\'re looking. <P> As you\'d expect from the sim\'s name, Red Baron 3D has undergone a major graphics overhaul. Running on a 3Dfx card, you\'ll find that the formerly blocky terrain graphics have been smoothed out with bilinear filtering. At low altitudes, trees pop up to give you a better reference as to your height above the ground. Explosions and other effects have been tuned as well, and the sim now supports up to 1024x768 resolution. <P> Unfortunately, those effects are available only on 3Dfx cards - there\'s no support for Direct3D, so cards with chipsets such as the Riva TNT or Matrox G200 will run the sim only in 2D DirectDraw mode. The 2D mode does support the higher resolutions, but even on a Pentium II/400 I needed to stick to 640x480 resolution to keep the frame rates completely smooth. <P> The sim\'s sounds deserve special praise. From the various engine sounds to the creaking of wooden struts as you stress your plane\'s airframe to the screams of enemy pilots as they jump from burning planes sans parachutes, they do a wonderful job of immersing you into the sim. <P> All these improvements serve to bring the program to the state at which it should have been released in the first place. But Dynamix didn\'t stop there. The formerly practically useless multiplayer mode has been tossed out and completely replaced with a server-based massively multiplayer version. You can now battle for free against up to 100 other human opponents via Sierra\'s free WON.NET matchmaking service, as well as on user-run servers (server software is included on the CD). Modes include melee (essentially deathmatch), team melee, and a capture-the-flag-style ""Get the Baron"" mode where only the last person to get a kill scores points. Unfortunately, there\'s no support for playing the sim\'s excellent missions cooperatively. <P> If you were disappointed by the initial release of Red Baron II, you definitely should give the program another try. You can download a patch for the original disc that includes everything you\'ll find on the Red Baron 3D CD (except for the server software) from www.redbaron3d.com. Or if you prefer, you can purchase Red Baron 3D, send back a form, the receipt, and your original Red Baron II CD, and Sierra will refund you the entire purchase price of Red Baron 3D. <P> While Red Baron II owners obviously have every reason to upgrade, this sim merits consideration by any fan of historical flight sims. Only MicroProse\'s new European Air War comes close to Red Baron 3D in capturing the atmosphere of historical air combat. Kudos to Sierra and Dynamix for taking a disappointing disaster and turning it into the best World War I simulation yet. <P> Editor\'s Note: The Red Baron 3D rebate offer mentioned in the review has ended. The patch to upgrade Red Baron II is still available. <i>--Denny Atkin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Hellfire: Diablo Expansion,,['Requires registered version of Diablo.'],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>', 'Requires registered version of Diablo.']",{},"['Build on the terror and adventure of <i>Diablo</i> with this expansion set. The software adds 12 new weapons, five new spells, 29 new foes, and the Monk, a new and powerful ally. There is also a whole new story to unravel and new demons to destroy.', 'To the surprise of many gamers, instead of releasing an expansion pack for Diablo, Blizzard North decided to focus its efforts on a full-fledged sequel (which has tentatively been given the appropriate, if unoriginal, title Diablo II). But gamers have continued to clamor for more Diablo, and eventually the expansion pack torch was passed to Blizzard\'s affiliate, Synergistic Software. Synergistic\'s Hellfire gives gamers new levels, monsters, items, spells, and single-player quests and refinements to the original Diablo engine, but the overall package is slightly less compelling than the original game. <P> As with Diablo, Hellfire\'s storyline is not particularly deep - Na\'Krul, a demon that once ranked highly in Diablo\'s hierarchy until turning on his master, is released from exile by ye local foolhardy mage. Na\'Krul and his cronies set up shop in eight new levels that fit seamlessly into the original game. These eight new levels are divided into two areas, each with its own new tileset, the gothic Demon Crypt (home sweet home for Na\'Krul) and the Festering Nest, an organic hive-like domain that hosts Na-Krul\'s ""Starship Troopers-refugee"" lieutenant, the Defiler. In addition to these new threats, you must once again deal with the big guy, Diablo, who returns more powerful than ever. <P> Although all the new monsters are confined to the new Hellfire levels, once you install Hellfire, you can find new items and shrines scattered throughout the original 16 levels of Diablo. You can use a new character class, the Monk, to conquer the challenges in the original game. The new Hellfire levels are roughly equivalent in difficulty to levels nine through 16 of the original game, which means you must either transfer a high-level character from the old game (through a needlessly cumbersome process), download one of the characters that has been made available at Sierra\'s web site, or trudge through the old levels with a new character if you want to survive the new levels. In addition to the new character class, items, and shrines, Hellfire provides a number of refinements to Diablo\'s gameplay - you can now jog instead of merely sauntering around town, cast spells to quickly find an exit to a level or to locate a tiny ring that you vaguely heard drop nearby, and can buy more useful items from the town\'s ever-greedy merchants. Synergistic has also added difficulty levels into the single-player version of the game, a feature inexplicably lacking from the original game. Gamers who are still playing Diablo will definitely appreciate these enhancements more than those who put Diablo back on the shelf long ago. <P> The most notable absence from Hellfire is multiplayer support, an especially surprising omission considering that Diablo is one of the most popular multiplayer games of all time. Given the amount of player hacking the original game underwent, it\'s not surprising that an unofficial hack has already appeared to let you use the Monk character class in a multiplayer game (but not on Battle.net, Blizzard\'s free Internet server). Future hacks may succeed in making the new levels and monsters accessible in a multiplayer game, but such hacks won\'t receive official sanction or support. For now, you\'ll be forced to play the new levels solo, which is reason enough for a significant portion of Diablo\'s fans to stay away from this expansion pack. <P> Hellfire includes a couple dozen new enemies, over 30 new magic items, seven new spells, and a handful of relatively simple new quests. The Monk character class is a very powerful fighter-mage. In addition to being a formidable spell-caster, the Monk is an adept martial artist who can use a staff to attack multiple opponents at once and is skilled in unarmed combat (yep, now you can kick Diablo in the head). The new spells include a healthy mix of defensive enchantments, devastating new offensive weapons (the original game\'s most powerful spells, Apocalypse and Nova, are now also available as spell books), and spells that just make wandering through the labyrinths more convenient. <P> Unlike the original game, most new monsters are represented by original artwork and are not just differently colored and powered variations of monsters previously used in the game. But there\'s a price to be paid for all the new art, as the monster animations and death sequences, in particular, appear to be less detailed than those included in the original game (although there are some great additions, such as the Liches, Crypt Demons, and Orbs). The new Demon Crypt tileset works well and is as detailed as any of the four tilesets in Diablo, but the Festering Nest tileset is a bit too disorienting and cluttered. There are, however, some nice graphical touches. For example, the barrels that appeared throughout the original game are replaced in the Festering Nest levels with organic body-snatcher-ish pods and by suitably gothic urns in the Demon Crypt. Hellfire adds some impressive new spell effects, such as huge glowing fireballs. The new levels also come with their own musical scores, which mainly consist of ambient sounds and don\'t measure up to the quality of the music in the original game. <P> Hellfire fails to provide as compelling an experience as Diablo, but does provides a good quantity of new monsters, items, spells, and settings, and a number of gameplay enhancements that eliminate a few annoyances of the original game. These additions and enhancements may not be sufficient to breathe new life into the original game, but if you are a single-player Diablo addict, Hellfire will enhance your enjoyment of Diablo. Hellfire is definitely more of the same, but that\'s not necessarily a bad thing, considering that Diablo was GameSpot\'s 1996 Game of the Year. Multiplayer aficionados, however, should pass on Hellfire. <i>--Desslock</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The game had tons of potential but was marred by numerous flaws, both in the overall design and several specific gameplay elements (you can see our original review here). Lords of Magic Special Edition promises to address the original game's shortcomings - and lo and behold it actually does. The only problem is that the game is still flawed in many ways and is not all that much more compelling than the original."", ""Without rehashing all of the basic information on story and game flow, we'll stick to addressing the changes in the Special Edition and how they affect the overall gameplay experience. One of the more notable new features is the included Legends of Urak Quest Pack. This expansion set of five scripted campaigns challenges you to complete a series of specific quests, sort of like the scenarios in Civilization II. For example, in one quest you play a Death Mage and must find and recover a sacred scepter for your lord, the King of Darkness. Another quest is based on Arthurian legends."", ""Another new feature is the lord editor, which basically allows you to modify your character at the beginning of each game. Instead of accepting the game's default settings for starting heroes, you can modify your starting army choosing units from any of the eight faiths. Using the new map editor, you can also customize the world in which you play."", 'The Special Edition features a number of new creatures, including one legendary creature for each faith. There are also many new wandering creatures as well as a general increase in ""marauding parties"" - easily the game\'s most annoying and infuriating feature. Marauding parties seem to be the rough equivalent to Civilization\'s barbarian tribes, except that they appear at alarming rates and mete out rather severe beatings in the face of seemingly superior opposition. Many a time I found myself cursing the puny marauding parties of wolves and centaurs who would take out half of my precious units and set me back by several days (that\'s game time, not real time).', ""One point in the Special Edition's favor is the fact that, although you spend far too much time battling marauding parties, you will probably spend far less time quarreling with your neighbors - even Balkoth. This is due to the game's enhanced diplomacy model, which offers more options and seems to have fewer loopholes. No longer will Balkoth fork over a level 5 hero when you plead for him (offering nothing in return). You can still acquire another faith's hero, but you have to put up some serious barter to do so. Also, whenever you put an offering on the bargaining table, the game will tell you whether or not it's a fair deal before you accept or decline it. This can be useful for avoiding ill feelings over unintentionally one-sided trade demands."", ""As a result of the improved diplomacy model (and presumably of improved AI), the game plays out a bit more like the story would dictate. Individual faiths are not necessarily at each other's throats and, if you play your cards right, you can actually win the game more easily by befriending your neighbors (except that Balkoth character; nobody likes him). I should point out, though, that the Fire faith begins the game in a very deep hole. No other faith has a positive opinion of Fire (except Chaos, which is typically the weakest of the AI-controlled faiths), and most are downright hostile right from the start."", ""In terms of problems that have been fixed, load times in the Special Edition are generally speedier (a very good thing), and Impressions has added an option to auto-compute battle results before loading the real-time combat engine. There's a trade-off to this, however, as now the auto-compute results are a bit less favorable to your side than they were in the original game."", 'You can now interact with any of your buildings without actually marching a hero to it - a very big improvement. This both saves time and allows you to manage your campaign without running back and forth to the capital city all of the time.', 'Though the Special Edition features several improvements, there remain a number of unresolved issues. For starters, it still takes far too long for your troops to recover from battle wounds, especially when they are low-level units. This means that for every minor skirmish you fight, you often have to rest for three or four days just to get your grunts back into fighting trim. While you rest, your AI opponents are building bigger fortunes and bigger, more-powerful armies.', 'Of course, the computer faiths may just have an advantage because they all seem to begin the game with armies that are at least twice as powerful as yours. They also seem to begin with more gold, more crystals, and more ale - all for no apparent reason.', 'Catching up to the AI requires that you take over your fair share of mines and breweries, but that is a nearly impossible task in the early going. In general, there seem to be fewer first- and second-level caves near your starting city, regardless of your faith. This means that you have to attack higher-level monsters earlier than you should. As a result, it is very difficult to keep your troops alive, let alone develop them into seasoned veterans.', 'And even unit advancement seems to have been slowed considerably. Troops often go through numerous battles - against higher-level foes - without gaining enough experience to move up a level. The final result of all these minor issues is that the game is far more difficult now, even on the easiest difficulty setting.', ""Real-time combat certainly doesn't help matters much. In fact, apart from adding multilevel dungeons and buildings for the combat mode, this aspect of the game doesn't seem to have changed much. It is still difficult to see all of your units clearly when they fight the enemy at close quarters. More to the point, it's extremely difficult to target the enemy units in these situations. This wouldn't be a huge problem except for the fact that your units often stand there doing nothing after they kill off their initial targets - whether or not there happen to be enemy units nearby. Troops still get hung up on the scenery, so real-time battles are still the same old micromanagement madness that they have always been."", 'Then there\'s the minor issue of defeating one of the other lords in battle. You might think that by defeating another faith\'s leader - and thereby eliminating them from the game (at least as far as Balkoth\'s goals of conquest are concerned) - you would have made your life a bit easier. But no. As soon as you fell your colleague, vast armies of his faith will pour into your lands, hurling themselves against your forces until they eventually overwhelm and destroy you. I wouldn\'t find this ""feature"" so odious if not for the fact that the same courtesy is unavailable to you (when your character dies, the game is over).', 'The Special Edition corrects a number of flaws and adds several new features but somehow ends up being only a tiny bit more appealing than its predecessor. For those players who enjoyed the original game, the many enhancements in the Special Edition probably make it a must-have. But for the rest of us, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic II (and soon III) and Warlords III are simply better options for a fantasy-strategy fix. <i>--Michael E.

Quest for Glory 5: Dragon Fire,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Combining the best elements of role playing with pulse-pounding action in the 3-D realm of Silmaria, <i>Dragon Fire</i> is a journey fraught with peril, mystery, and enchantment. Take the adrenaline rush alone or share it with friends on the Internet. The game is recommended for ages 13 and up.', 'I have been a Quest for Glory fan since I played the first Hero\'s Quest over seven years ago. Although I have always loved role-playing games, I never really played too many adventure games. But Hero\'s Quest blended the two genres together into a greater whole that I found instantly appealing. The series, which later became Quest for Glory, combined the dialogue, item hunts, and other classic story-driven goals of adventure games with the combat, magic, and character interaction of RPGs. Each time I sat down to play a Quest for Glory game, I walked away completely satisfied upon finishing the game. I played the first, second, and third games but never got around to playing Quest IV. That was supposed to be the last Quest for Glory game, but thanks to a plethora of fan mail, Sierra was persuaded to create a final chapter in the Quest for Glory saga. The Coles, the creators of the previous games, returned to scribe an ending to our Hero\'s tales, and I was ready to retire one of my favorite game characters in his ultimate adventure. <P> As excited as I was about putting on the shoes of Hero again, I forgave the admittedly lackluster graphics. After all, role-playing games and adventures are about story, and Quest for Glory especially is about plot, characters, and humor. Quest for Glory V has all that. In fact, after looking at my first item and talking to my first NPC, it was as if I had never left the series. The humor and style of the previous Quest games is wholly intact in this final chapter. Quest for Glory has always had a juvenile sense of humor, with corny jokes and heavy sexual innuendo. So of course, you can flirt with all the women in the game, and you can give and receive a number of groaners. Of course, this is something that Quest for Glory fans have come to expect from the series, so rather than be put off by the game\'s quirky sense of humor, I was heartened. This was the game I remembered. However, if I weren\'t a fan of the series, I don\'t know if I would appreciate the game\'s humor. <P> The basic plot requires you to answer a summons for help from the kingdom of Silmaria, nestled in the island area of Marete. Ages ago, Atlantis resided around these waters, but the Dragon of Doom crippled it, sending it to the ocean floor. A handful of mages bound the dragon to the earth with the aid of seven pillars. Now, Silmaria is suffering a chain of events that will not only destroy the kingdom, but also unleash the dragon to finish the obliteration of Atlantis. As Hero, you come to Silmaria - via the magic of your mage mentor Erasmus - to right all the wrongs perpetrated on Silmaria. Your adventures manifest themselves in the form of the Rites of Rulership. The king of Silmaria has been assassinated, and the Rites have been convened to select a new ruler. Erasmus and your liontaur companion, Rakeesh, have entered you into the contest so you can travel Marete and find the real killer. If you win the Rites and become King in the process... well, that\'s an added bonus. <P> There are seven Rites, and as you finish each one, more of the game\'s plot is revealed. You soon find that the assassinations, the raids on Silmaria\'s fishing villages, the kingdom\'s war with the tritons of Atlantis, and many other problems are all related. Eventually, you\'ll meet the mastermind behind all this evil and even confront the Dragon itself. <P> As a Quest fan, I was glad to see old faces from the previous games. Rakeesh is back, as are Elsa, Erasmus, Erana, Katrina, and several other characters. Disappointingly, Rakeesh and Erasmus have relatively small roles in the game. I liked that the characters\' dialogue trees refreshed after certain quests or periods of time. The gameworld isn\'t very large, but the continually updated events and dialogue kept the game from feeling too confined. There was always something to do. Aside from the seven main quests, there are also side quests that don\'t have to be completed but do give you special items, open new lines of dialogue with NPCs, and add to your score. The first two quests are very straightforward, but the later quests have less in the way of direction. In some ways, this is good. You are left to think up solutions on your own to the quests and to find your own way of arriving at those solutions. Some quests are clever, but other times, you could be stuck wandering around the gameworld, lost and frustrated. The middle game, especially, feels too much like an adventure game where you have to go poking and prodding at every single pixel, looking for certain items. <P> Some of the game\'s voice acting was good, but some voices were too strained and annoying (Cerberus is especially terrible). The music was good, with some excellent tracks and event-specific music. The graphics aren\'t bad, although extreme close-ups of Hero don\'t look very good. The prerendered backgrounds look nice, and the undulating sea waves are especially good. One of my biggest complaints about the game is the lack of a zoom feature in combat. Sometimes, you could be caught in a battle at the far end of the map, meaning you and your target are barely large enough to click on. This is exasperated when you cast the shrink spell. What makes the problem even worse is the bad interface, which never distinguishes between ""hot"" items and useless ones. The cursor should light up when you pass over items you can pick up, locations of interest, or enemies and characters. The interface just compounds the problem when you have to look for a specific item or panel (this is most pronounced when finding the crane operation panel on Science Island). <P> I do like that the game plays differently depending on which character you choose. Each class has a few extra quests and abilities, and solutions to certain puzzles and combat differ depending on your character\'s abilities. This definitely accentuates the role-playing aspect of the game and makes replay a very real possibility, if you can stomach rehashing some of the game\'s faults. I do think Quest for Glory is a pretty good game, but much of what fueled my desire to play the game was nostalgia. The game plays very much like what I remembered but with added stories and the chance to revisit old acquaintances. That\'s what I wanted. However, gamers unused to Quest for Glory might be put off by the less-than-stellar graphics and ""old school"" gameplay. Gamers also might be put off by Quest for Glory V\'s bugs. I ran into a few, and people have complained about several others. Some bugs prevent the completion of certain side quests, while others will dump you out to the desktop. Also, the promised multiplayer support is absent, although a patch is supposed to enable it sometime in the future. <P> I really enjoyed my first ten hours of Quest for Glory V, but as the game wore on, I became more frustrated by the pace of the game and the pixel-hunting instances of gameplay. A better interface, a quest log that showed you what you had to do, and better handling of combat would have alleviated some of my concerns. I did finish the game, and I enjoyed it overall, but the ending was definitely disappointing. As the final farewell to Hero, this game should have at least included an epilogue of some sort that let you know what happened to Hero and all his companions. Quest for Glory V has a few quirks and problems that will try your patience, but series fans will want to play this game to see old friends and follow Hero\'s last adventure. <i>--Elliott Chin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Drive cool cars and experience the ultimate racing excitement on your PC! Cars include the &lt;b&gt;Aston Martin DB7&lt;/b&gt;, Ferrari 550 Maranello, and the Lamborghini Diablo SV, and more!', 'I don\'t usually play racing games on the PC. Either they\'re pale imitations of the arcade and console racers, or they\'re boring 50-lap simulations. I mean, why play Need for Speed II and Test Drive 4 on the PC when I can play Super GT in the arcade and Gran Turismo on the PlayStation? For ages, I told friends that the PC had nothing on the arcade, even venerable classics like Daytona and Sega Rally. Well, I think I\'m going to be eating crow for the next few weeks... and loving it. Not only is the latest Need for Speed miles ahead of the last NFS game, but it approaches (and dare I say surpasses?), the best of the consoles in terms of sheer fun and speed. <P> Need for Speed III is a great game. It has an exhilarating sense of speed, clean and beautiful graphics, polished production values, and trackloads of unadulterated fun. In many ways, Need for Speed III has that same addictive quality I found in Quake II, Starcraft, and Heroes of Might and Magic. That\'s pretty celebrated company, but I don\'t think it\'s an unfounded categorization. Need for Speed III has that same ""just one more turn or just one more deathmatch"" quality that the other games have. And just like in those games, the action in Need for Speed III is so engrossing and rewarding that the next time you come up for air, you\'ll find that two hours have whizzed by. <P> While Need for Speed III shares an addictive quality with those games, it has something of its own: pure speed. This game is fast and fun. The frame rate is fast and incredibly clean. I\'ve played my fair share of PC and console racers where the pop-up was horrible, as cliffs and buildings would suddenly appear out of thin air, many seconds after you should have seen them on the horizon. Whether it\'s the smart track design or the beautiful engine, the bottom line is that I only saw one or two instances of minor pop-up. And multiplayer is as fast and fun as the single-player experience. The sound of your revving engine and the fast frame rate both combined to create the illusion of breakneck speeds, although the replays didn\'t look quite as fast I would have liked. <P> Aside from the speed and addictive quality, Need for Speed III has the requisite list of features that marketers like to put on boxes, journalists like to list, and consumers always look for. There are many cars, with subtle differences, and the ability to tweak more than a few car qualities, such as steering speed, aerodynamics, and suspension. And, surprisingly, the tweaks will affect your car noticeably. <P> In classic Need for Speed fashion, there are more than a dozen supercars to race, including several bonus cars that open up with sustained excellent race results or cheat codes. The range of cars is a fascinating gallery of every car enthusiast\'s dream vehicles: Corvettes, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Porsches, Jaguars, Mercedes, and an Italdesign prototype car. There are also roughly ten tracks, including the bonus track, encompassing several different environments and difficulty levels. You\'ll race through a canyon, snowy mountain caps, urban utopia, and forests. You can race during nighttime and in rain to add further to the track variety. Visibility takes a huge hit in either condition, making races on the harder courses incredibly treacherous. Unfortunately, I didn\'t experience any noticeable difference in driving under rain; the road didn\'t appear any slicker and handling was pretty much consistent with perfect weapon. If there was a difference, it was too subtle for me to notice. <P> The single-player game modes include a single race, knockoff (where you eliminate the last place of each race), tournament (where you race through the entire circuit for points), and hot pursuit. Hot pursuit is EA\'s answer to all the critics who lamented the loss of the cops in Need for Speed II. You aren\'t only trying to outrace an opponent, but also escape the pursuing cops. Three tickets, and you\'re out. Or alternatively, you can play the cop in pursuit. The radio chatter alerting you to the cops\' presence and their strategies (pursuit or roadblock) are nice touches. <P> The graphics in the game are pretty amazing. The reflection on the cars is outstanding, as is the rain, and the leaves and dust that follow in your wake. The lighting is especially impressive during the night and rain races. Best of all, everything, including the up to seven competitors, animating background objects, and your rearview mirror, can be packed on screen with barely a hint of a performance hit (OK, sometimes, it will slow down slightly, but not by much). The production values on the track briefings and the car gallery are also first-rate. <P> There are a few problems. For one, the dashboard doesn\'t light up at night, and there are no windshield wipers at your disposal during rain. It\'s disappointing that there\'s no damage to your cars. I understand that none of the car companies want to see their poor little vehicles hurt in this game, but what\'s the excuse for not being able to dent the nonsupercars you crash into? And unlike in the latest Sega arcade racers, the cars in Need for Speed III, while maintaining an effective illusion of high-speed driving, sometimes appear too much like they are gliding on the road rather than actually driving and hugging the road. And why not just open all the regular cars (not the bonus cars) in hot pursuit, knockoff, and tournament mode? Still, it\'s a testament to the game\'s addictive fun factor that when I was racing, none of these shortcomings ever bothered me. While the arcades still have the edge in racing games, Need for Speed III goes a long way toward giving PC gamers a real taste of exhilarating arcade speed and action. <i>--Elliott Chin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

But the advent of the analog controller, SCE's PlayStation code optimization utilities, and a few new imaginative ideas on the part of Psygnosis have all combined to make the series a trilogy. (Yes, let's just decide right here and now to forget Wipeout 64 entirely.) <P>Futuristic racing is the rule of the day in all the Wipeout games. You compete in a series of winding courses that can only be raced by the sleekest of antigravity hovercraft. You gain boosts in velocity by flying over speed pads and acquire offensive capabilities by going over the weapon pads. Each vehicle is equipped with shields, which are worn down by enemy fire and by bumping into track walls, and are recharged by entering each course's pit lane. W3 introduces a new element that drains the shield energy: the hyper-thrust. By hitting the R1 button, your craft can achieve incredible speeds, but it is then much more open to crashing or being blown up by opponents. The tightrope walk of balancing thrust and shields is the first main difference between Wipeout 3 and its predecessors.  <P>The first tournament (not the only mode in the game, but its meat and potatoes) is incredibly easy. You can beat it without using the hyper-thrust, a single offensive power-up, or the air brakes, which help you coax your machine around corners. But the tournament mode then goes from very easy to unbelievably hard, as the courses in the second tournament are so difficult that it's hard to place in any of them, let alone all in a row. The first two tracks - Sampa Run and Hi-Fumi - are very challenging, but you can master them after playing them for an hour to an hour and a half each, while the third track - P-Mar Project - is so snaky that it's evil that the developers didn't save it for later. There is no middle ground in W3. The learning curve in the first two games was gradual and fun to play, but this one is surprisingly severe. You'll have to hit the hyper-thrust on the straight-aways, aim into the pit or steal shield energy from opponents by using the energy-drain power-up (one of several new weapons), and use the air brake to shimmy around every corner just to place at all. It calls to mind hopping around while trying to balance a plate at the end of a stick from the tip of your nose, two index fingers, big toe, and knee. It can be that tough, but if you give it enough time - a lot of time - it actually becomes almost second nature. <P>Since you'll find the tournament nigh impossible to beat at first, you'll end up checking out the game's challenge mode, which is made up of tasks in race, weapon, and time categories. Race lets you hone your skills against other opponents, one track at a time. The super-difficult tournament courses can eventually be unlocked, and while they take more than an hour of practice to beat, they are fun to play singly, and they prepare you for the eventual return to the tournament. The weapon mode requires you to destroy a varying number of enemies within a varying number of passes on progressively tougher courses, and time trial sets a time by which you have to finish. These challenges are like the practice mode in House of the Dead 2; they're almost more enjoyable than the main game, and they help you master all the skills you'll need to win. <P>The other main addition to Wipeout on the PlayStation is the split-screen two-player mode. If you wanted to compete against a friend in Wipeout XL, you had to use the PlayStation link cable and set up two TVs with two PlayStations right next to each other. Not only do you not have to put that much work into it anymore, you now have two modes designed to work well with two players. The two-player tournament is a fantastic addition that gives the game a huge amount of replay value. The challenge presented by the single-player tournament is immense, and just imagine it with the addition of a real-live human opponent added to the mix. It's exactly the sort of thing players have been requesting for years, and with it, Psygnosis has set a new standard for console racing games. There's another mode, called elimination, which is similar to the weapon challenge - you compete for the highest number of ships destroyed - but since you fight race-by-race instead of in an elimination tournament, you probably won't return to it very often. It also exists in the single-player side, where it's even more aimless. <P>Graphics and music have always been especially important to Wipeout, and in W3, they're still quite impressive. The game's techno soundtrack comprises songs from Underworld, Chemical Brothers, and Propellerheads, and while the tracks aren't quite as strong as those in Wipeout XL (the WXL soundtrack was likely the best in any home game, so it's hard to beat), they're still very, very good. The graphics look a little grainy this time out, but pop-up is nonexistent in single-player and not too rough in the multiplayer. Essentially, W3 looks and sounds the way you'd expect it to: great.. It could be said that the series has lost some of its arcade racing-game appeal. It's always been a smart arcade racer, and now it's positively brainy, for better and worse. You'll have to memorize where you want to come out around every corner of every track, just like in Wipeout XL, but now you just have several other things to think about at the same time. W3 should appeal to longtime fans of the series who are looking for a new challenge and perhaps to folks who didn't find the license tests of Gran Turismo too frustrating. It is, however, sure to turn off many new players because of its high level of difficulty. Its pluses far outweigh its flaws, though, and while it doesn't steal the title belt from Wipeout XL as the best futuristic racing game of all time, it's a worthy sequel. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Expect  gore, and lots of it."", ""Surprisingly, disc loading times in midlevel are short, and the movement is fluid with fast  frame rates. Also, the control using the dual shock game pad is very well implemented,  although for the small percentage of PlayStation owners who bought a mouse for the  system, this game is compatible. In fact, <I>Quake II</I> makes the purchase of a mouse  a worthwhile decision. Multiplayer games excel, even with tedious split screens. Rather  than letting you save your progress anywhere, the game has specific saving points within  each level, and enough of them so that you won't be too frustrated. <i>--Jeff  Young</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>One of the best first-person shooters on the PlayStation</li> <li>Vertigo-inducing realism</li> <li>Great use of PlayStation controllers and optional mouse</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Incredibly violent</li> </ul>', ""Yes, Quake II, the game PC owners have been enjoying for a long time, has finally made it to the PlayStation. Being a fan of PC first-person shooters, I was less than excited. I mean, I've already played the single-player to death on the PC, and multiplayer FPS games on a console are usually quite pathetic. The N64 version was pretty good, provided that you could look past the flaws that most fans of the PC version would notice in the first 20 seconds. The PlayStation version has many of these same flaws, but given the PlayStation's rapidly aging hardware, it's easier to overlook these flaws. While you may not remain interested in the single-player mission to see it to its completion, the four-player multiplayer in Quake II will make you glad you had picked up a multitap and three extra Dual Shocks. <P>The storyline is your typical hostile alien sort of thing. You, as a space marine, land on the planet of Stroggos with the intention of blowing up everything in sight. Unfortunately, you get separated from the rest of the marines and are forced to go it alone. So now you must run all over this planet, collecting keys, opening doors, taking elevators, and wiping out various alien monsters before they tear you in half. To wipe out these aliens, you'll have to find weapons - your wimpy default blaster simply won't cut it. You'll find a couple shotguns, two types of machine guns, a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, and two types of energy weapons - one of which is the almighty BFG, a gun that spits out a huge power ball and wipes out just about anything that gets near the blast. You'll also find a great deal of ammo, armor, and health scattered about the levels. <P>A game like this really requires a good control scheme to succeed. Thanks to excellent use of the Dual Shock controller, it has one. In the default setup, you use the left stick to look around and the four buttons on the front of the pad to move in any of four directions. You can also configure the right analog stick so you can use it in much the same way. The R buttons handle firing and jumping, and the L buttons let you cycle through your weaponry. You can play the game on a standard controller, but trust me - you wouldn't want to. The game also supports the PlayStation mouse, but if you're  already used to using a mouse to control your first-person shooters, then you probably have a PC and you've been playing the PC version of Quake II for ages, making this game mostly useless. <P>Graphically, the PlayStation really does a decent job. The textures may look a little washed-out, a few models may have been simplified, and a few frames of animation may have been chopped here and there, but overall, the game runs at a very playable speed. The tradeoff is that the game has much more frequent loads. Most of the level modification between the PC and PlayStation versions is in the addition of many more small, closed-off hallways that serve as little loading areas. At first it's not a big deal, but when you've got to go back and forth between different parts of a level to accomplish various tasks, loading every 20-30 seconds is enough to make you crazy. The game's sound effects and music are taken directly from the PC version, and overall, the sound is great. <P>The multiplayer mode is where this title picks up most of its value points. Sure, a few of the multiplayer levels are a little on the weak side, but there are enough good ones that it doesn't really matter. The three modes in the game are standard deathmatch, team deathmatch, and versus. Versus mode is a last-man-standing affair, where you and up to three friends duke it out until only one of you remains. The coolest multiplayer option is the gravity slider, which lets you turn gravity way down for some really high-flying action, or turn it way up to keep people from hopping around like lunatics. Sure, it's not as versatile as being able to program your own modifications to the game, but it's a nice touch, and it manages to breathe a bit of life into the game. <P>In the end, the PlayStation version of Quake II falls under the same disclaimers as most other PC-to-console first-person shooters - if you own the PC version, don't waste your time. But if you're looking for some good split-screen shooting action with a decent single-player mode to back it up, this version will make your day. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

However, we\'ll also be adding new features, vehicles, characters, and so on, to take Vigilante 8 to the next level.""', 'The game takes on a futuristic play mechanic with the addition of Back To the Future-like hovering cars, which allows you fly to a certain extent.

Running on a rebuilt and modified version of the original engine, Second Offense brings new cameras, new power-ups, new weapons, and most, importantly, new vehicles and characters. There will be more new characters than old, with favorites from the original game returning as unlockable characters. As in the original, every character will have his own vehicle, mission objective, gang affiliation, stats, and special weapon. Along with the hoverpods, you can also pick up power-ups that turn your wheels into water-friendly rotors or snow treads.', ""Graphically, the game has improvements over its predecessor with new effects like fog, brake lights, exhaust, water effects, and bigger, more-impressive explosions. On the Dreamcast, this game looks particularly gorgeous. There's still a bit of pop-up in the current beta version, but that will surely be improved before the game's release. In the sound department, Second Offense offers more of the '70s-inspired funk grooves that rocked the original, as well as refined and brand-new sound effects."", 'One large improvement over the original will be a two-player version of the original\'s quest mode, with broader and more involving objectives.

But it can be considered by the same criteria we judge games by: graphics, sound, value, and so forth. Unlike many of the music games that have shown up throughout the last year or so - Parappa, Um Jammer Lammy, and Konami's Bemani series, to name a few - MTV: MG is a music-making tool that attempts to take what PC music-editing and music-creating programs let you do full scale and brings the experience to the novice consumer who happens to own a PlayStation.  It works like this: You pop in the Music Generator disc and choose to create a song. By hitting the circle button on your control pad, you can select from a list of menu items, including what you need to get started: the riff library, which includes about 4,500 samples. In this section, you choose from beats, drums, vocal samples, melodies, bass lines, and so forth, and you place the riffs on the blank score. You then build your song (which we can't tell you how to do here - just be creative), checking and editing it as you go, then saving it when you're finished.  This mode is intuitive and simple, and if you bear in mind your limited memory capacity before you get too far into your song, you will be pleased with what you are able to create so quickly and effortlessly. But the real fun and, likewise, the real downfall of the program appears when you try the more advanced maneuvers. For example, you can record samples from audio CDs by swapping out the disc with the CD of your choice and then following simple commands that pop up on your screen. Once you record the audio you want, it's immediately stored in the sampled riff palette until you move it, save it, and access it later. While this sounds like a great idea and certainly rounds out the program, it's extremely limited. Likewise, the intuitive interface takes a plunge once you start looking around for your newly sampled riff. But the true disappointment, which should come as no surprise, is that you can only save seconds of audio before you run out of memory entirely. And the more self-sampled audio you use, the fewer library riffs you can slip in. You'll realize right away that the ideal setting for intense music creation is not the 2MB RAM PlayStation. In addition, the program, albeit intuitive, is not too attractive. Graphically, it's dull, even if it works. There's a video-editing option as well, wherein you synch up basic moving images and patterns to the song you created. You can also set the program to automate these videos. The problem is, once again, memory space. You're very limited by what you can do, and in the end, these video clips end up looking like low-budget college-computer-lab projects... at best. On the positive side, the game doesn't pretend to woo sound-savvy music editors or individuals with tons of mixing experience. Likewise, it doesn't tell you to ditch the PC editors and use this instead. MTV: Music Generator simply provides the experience of mixing for those who likely won't invest a couple hundred dollars in the very affordable and just as intuitive PC music editor Sonic Foundry Acid or any others, for that matter.  And what it promises to do, it does it well. The basic functions are simple enough so that even someone with no music-making experience can get the hang of making a moderately complex song. And if you want to stretch the basics, you can. You can edit riffs, split riffs, as well as play around with keys, tone bending, envelopes, fades, and you name it - memory permitting.  There's a multiplayer jam mode, too. This option lets you play turn-based one-to-four-player sessions that has each of you managing certain beats, rhythms, or melodies to form one complete song. Half the fun is figuring it out, but it's not the kind of game or experience you'll likely go back to often. But it was surprising to see a program like this include a shared experience, so there's value in the inventiveness, if not in the actually gameplay.  For its price, MTV: Music Generator is worth it. It's sort of like the run on Casio keyboards in the early '80s - every house seemed to have one, and most owners didn't have a clue what to do with them. You pounded out basic songs and threw in some drumbeats. This program is more advanced than that and quite a bit more fun. If you're a serious musician and tool around on your PC, you're probably going to be frustrated or bored, as the RAM is obviously limited and the library is nothing you haven't seen or used before. And frankly, there are better libraries elsewhere. But for PlayStation owners who just want a fun, addictive music-making tool, you'll likely be pretty amused, if not downright mesmerized. At least long enough to justify the cost.<i>--Lauren Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Black Dahlia - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Three major historical phenomena form the basis for the <i>Black Dahlia</i> story line. Although separated in both time and space, these events were linked by more than simple murder. The methodology, the systematic deliberation involved in these murders, and the lack of common reason fascinates and compels us to look deeper into the forces responsible for these acts. <P>First, let us examine the reign of terror carried out in Cleveland by America\'s first modern serial killer. This cunning psychopath, known as the Torso Killer, can be linked to dozens of slayings. Many of his victims were found dismembered and neatly wrapped in newspaper along a stretch of industrial wasteland called Kingsbury Run. He was never apprehended despite an intense--even eerie--manhunt carried out by some of the day\'s top law enforcement officers, including the famous ""Untouchable"" Eliot Ness. The killer\'s activities mysteriously ceased just before the outbreak of World War II, which incidentally is the next major historical event that plays a role in our story. <P>The rise of fascism in Europe and the incomprehensible defeat of both Poland and France at the hands of Nazi Germany caused many to speculate that the Germans had more than a tactical military advantage over its opponents. To some, this led to a conviction that a network of spies and traitors must have played a significant role in Hitler\'s victories; to others, it pointed to supernatural aid. <P>Finally, the third, and in some ways most tragic, piece of history that has inspired our story is the murder of a young actress in Los Angeles, California. <P>Whatever motives these various historical figures may have had, it is not difficult to draw parallels between them. Our plot ties these events, leading from the barbarous madness of the Torso Killer and the murderer of Elizabeth Short to the architects of the Holocaust who nearly succeeded in plunging our world into a new Dark Age. <P>Features: <BR>* An unprecedented freedom of movement within the game\'s 3-D-rendered, ultrarealistic, ""living"" environment <BR>* An intricate, twisting plot line that will keep you guessing right up to the very end <BR>* Over 70 tightly integrated, highly relevant puzzles and thrilling combat sequences will provide challenges for gamers of all tastes <BR>* A truly epic scale that carries the gamer to over 80 locations on two continents over the course of five years <BR>* An exciting cast of professional actors, including Hollywood\'s Dennis Hopper and Teri Garr <BR>* A story that is derived from history and in which every detail has been painstakingly researched', 'Take 2\'s track record in the adventure game genre has been shaky, to say the least. First there was the overhyped and disappointing Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller, which was followed by the just-plain-terrible Bureau 13, and then by the nearly good Ripper. The last game was a major step forward for the company - while it still emphasized Hollywood production values (the big commercial push was the fact that Christopher Walken starred in it), it actually had bona fide puzzles. The latest offering from the company, Black Dahlia, is yet another step in the right direction; there are some interesting design decisions, a few good puzzles, and some amazing technology. But every positive aspect of Black Dahlia is outweighed by a negative, and what begins as an interesting tale of conspiracy and murder ends up a confused and confusing gore fest of the not-so-supernatural. <P> Black Dahlia loosely deals with the true-life murder of Elizabeth Short, an aspiring actress found brutally murdered in Los Angeles in the mid-1940s. Short\'s obsession with the color black led newspapers at the time to dub her the Black Dahlia. Though the game takes its title from this famously unsolved case, it only touches on the murder, which is simply one minor plot point in a sprawling tale of a Teutonic order trying to lay its hands on a magical gem called, coincidentally enough, the Black Dahlia. <P> The game does an interesting job of tying historical fact to its own fiction. The Cleveland ""Torso Killer"" of the early \'40s plays a part, as does the FBI, the Untouchable Elliot Ness, and almost the whole of the Nazi Party. You take on the role of Jim Pearson, a COI operative investigating possible Nazi conspirators in Cleveland. Your investigation leads you to a much deeper mystery, and you must enlist the aid of your predecessor (played by Dennis Hopper in a minor role), who everyone thinks has gone mad because of his obsession with the supernatural. Up until this point, the game is quite fascinating. The puzzles, while sometimes requiring great leaps of logic, are solid and seem like an actual part of the story. But once everything starts to come together storywise, everything falls apart in the game. <P> First, the story just goes wild and stops making any sense. Your character is plagued by nightmares that start invading his daily life in some of the least impressive horror scenes since Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh. The connections between the various divergent elements are all but wrapped up halfway through the game, and you spend the rest of your time simply tracking down the gem in a variety of locales. That is until the final sequence, which not only has little to do with everything that led up to it, but is also a relatively inane and obvious ""homage"" to the finale of Raiders of the Lost Ark. <P> And if lamenting the demise of a promising story weren\'t enough, you\'re faced with some boilerplate puzzles for which the phrase ""tacked-on"" would be a compliment. After the first act of Black Dahlia, there are only three real puzzle types: jigsaw puzzles, lever-moving puzzles, and slider puzzles. There are a few interesting and challenging puzzles scattered about, but the preponderance of ""secret door locks"" just becomes ridiculous. At one point, you must solve two of these in a row. The game then jumps a few years into the future. You\'re immediately faced with three more. It\'s almost as if Agent Pearson has been promoted to ""director of slider puzzle operations."" <P> What makes all of this nonsense more disappointing is that the technology in the game is really good. It uses sort of a ""node"" system (similar to Zork Nemesis) in which you move from one predetermined location to the next, and in these places you can look in any direction. The graphics are nicely rendered and the integration of video with pre-rendered backgrounds in the exploration sequences is really impressive. <P> Adventure gamers who don\'t mind puzzles that are rote and unrelated to the story will probably enjoy the bulk of Black Dahlia. The technology is nice, the story is interesting for a while, and the game is relatively long. But those longing for the days when puzzles were actually a part of the story will probably find Black Dahlia to be just another pretty romp through a bunch of unrelated locales. <i>--Ron Dulin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Toy Story 2,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['Buzz Lightyear and the gang are back in this fast-action family game, which is inspired by the Disney/Pixar feature film <i>Toy Story 2</i>. Your mission is to keep Woody the Cowboy from falling into the hands of a toy collector. Film favorites Hamm the pig, Rex the dinosaur, and Slinky the dog are back to help you save your friend in this 3-D-based action game.', ""While movie-based games are always a hit-or-miss venture, this title does look promising. A quick peek at this game reveals that it succeeds in preserving the charm and humor that characterizes the hit film. The cute, colorful design of the various game levels does not come at the expense of gameplay. You'll have to travel through 15 levels and five nasty bosses, including the evil Zurg, to get to the end of this graphically impressive game. Fortunately, you'll have several special weapons to help your cause, including rocket jet boots, an arm laser, moon spring boots, and a grappling hook. Young and old Disney fans will definitely want to give this game a try."", 'The N64 version of Toy Story 2 surprisingly doesn\'t win any graphics competitions against the PlayStation game, and actually falls short of the 32-bit companion. The gameplay, however, salvages what the visual side is lacking. Unfortunately, the lack of animated cutscenes from the film is sorely missed. Part of what makes the Toy Story 2 game experience fun is that it\'s like interacting with the movie. Still screens with oversimplified text just doesn\'t seem the Pixar way. Toy Story 2 is something like n-Space\'s Rugrats: Search for Reptar in that it has mission-based levels set off a hub, which, in both cases, is a house, and that it follows the film\'s scenarios to a T. Toy Story 2 is larger, with about 15 levels (three levels within five zones) you can play through them either as quickly and easily or as difficultly as you wish. By picking up all the items and solving all  the puzzles, Toy Story 2 has a bit more complexity than Rugrats, which probably exists more in the ""good for kids"" category. Toy Story 2 wants to appeal to a broad range of gamers, not just kids, and this is obvious in its level design. In each of the levels you have several objectives. You have puzzles to solve, tokens to collect, enemies to fight, and items to find - in addition to a boss fight at the end of zone. However, once you complete one objective, you have the option to move on, fight the boss, and work your way to the next zone. It\'s usually easy to acquire 50 tokens in a level, as they\'re scattered about the environment, often lending clues as to which obstacles you can jump on, and so forth. You can also pick up tokens from dead toys you\'ve destroyed with your Buzz Lightyear laser. Eventually you must go back and replay levels, if you haven\'t picked up all the goods, as you\'ll need a decent-sized stash of Pizza Planet tokens to advance toward the final stages. But as in any game, you learn certain skills as you progress that will make stages that had seemed difficult in the beginning much easier. The graphics, however, were disappointing. Not bad, but not what you\'d hope for from the N64 - given what developers started out with in the Toy Story motif. With movie license games, it\'s easy to assume that the PlayStation/N64 trade-off, should both versions exist, will be graphics for the N64 and sound and fmv for the PlayStation. This is not the case. The PlayStation version actually has both, and the N64 offering was pretty weak. Without scenes from the film, the movie\'s energy is gone. The look and feel is there, but the mood is not. The environments are colorful; they\'re mostly easy to get around in and free of depth perception. But the color seemed a little flat on the N64, even with the same nice touches found in the PlayStation version, such as Buzz\'s reflection being visible from inside his space helmet when you\'re in targeting or close-up mode. The cameras presented a bit of a problem. You could choose passive or active cameras, with either you in charge of the camera or the camera in charge of itself. You decide. What\'s good is that you can change between active and passive cameras on the fly during gameplay. You\'ll probably find yourself doing this quite often in the beginning. When the active camera is agreeable, it\'s suspiciously good. But then, seconds later, you\'ll find yourself cornered in an alley, pushing a box next to a chair that you must jump on to leap onto a scale that will in turn send you soaring into the air. This isn\'t fun with a camera whipping around you like a mosquito, yet you\'ve too much going on to manage your camera while you navigate your jumps, grabs, and leaps. This becomes a problem far too often, dragging the game\'s overall score down a bit. It\'s certainly not the worst camera system out there, and you will get used to it and probably settle on the active camera at some point, cursing your way through the game. It proves the game to be yet another notch away from being a kid\'s game. For a movie with generous voice-over already in the can, you\'d expect an overload of catch phrases and one-liners in the licensed game. This is not the case, and Crystal Dynamics could learn a thing or two for Gex from this one. It\'s a simple model: Less is more. The voices from the film are intact, but they\'re not out of hand, at least Buzz\'s voice isn\'t. It does get a bit annoying when Hamm whines, ""Buzz, come \'ere"" the entire time you\'re in his territory. And Sarge\'s pep talk gets old pretty fast. But for the most part, the catch phrases are few and far between - just enough to make it interesting without driving you to the brink. And the music? Toy Story music. \'Nuff said.<i>--Lauren Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Risk,,['complete with original sleeve and instructions'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""You remember Risk, that classic board game where contestants vie for global  domination through military strategy? It's been taken off the kitchen table and ported into  your PlayStation, where you can hone your tactics against computer opponents or  challenge up to three of your closest enemies."", ""The classic Risk level shows the game as you remember it. The easy-to-use interface will  quickly whisk you into the heat of war. Those interested in more challenging gameplay  should try the ultimate Risk level, which features weather variables, geographic  obstacles, and fortifications. As a general, you'll create alliances with other players, take  their armies captive, set booby traps, and employ super troops that fight harder and live  longer."", ""No matter your struggle--classic or ultimate--<I>Risk</I> offers you the unique  opportunity of crushing your opponents while taking over the world. And though you  can't knock all the game pieces over in a frustrated rage if you lose... you can hit the reset  button. <I>--Eric Twelker</I>"", 'Hasbro Interactive has successfully ""ported"" one of the oldest and most popular turn-based strategy games to the PlayStation. This one has all the elements of the board game down: the cards, the geographically dubious map, even onscreen dice that roll with a thunderous clamor. Plus you can mix real opponents with CPU ones, and there are lots of odd new options, including Blind Risk and Ultimate Risk, which replace  the ease and speed of Classic Risk with some rudimentary realism and strategic considerations. In fact, the only thing missing is the little plastic roman numerals. <P>For the uninitiated, the game of Risk may seem a little odd. Idiosyncrasies abound. At the beginning of the game, each opponent\'s armies are distributed randomly throughout the world - though a manual battalion placement option is available. When you conquer territories you are awarded strange playing cards with cannons and horses on them that are redeemable for reinforcements. Last-surviving defending armies always win in a tied roll of the dice, making them fairly fearsome opponents when outnumbered. Plus there\'s the steamroller effect, by which a single country with enough reinforcements and a little luck can take over territory after territory in a single turn. As long as it doesn\'t run out of troops, it can keep going until it has taken over the entire world. In short, realism is out the window. And that\'s what makes it Risk. <P>Hasbro Interactive could have made the PlayStation version much more realistic. It could have included troop morale, food supplies, different types of units (there\'s only one), and so forth. Heck, it could\'ve thrown the old game out the window and slapped the license on a brand-spankin\'-new real-time strategy game with hyperrealism, and the N64 version could have used the Rumble Pak to simulate troop hunger. Thank God Hasbro didn\'t. Hasbro Interactive made the right call by leaving it simple, full of illogical rules that also happen to be really fun. Like the original, Risk for the PlayStation is straight-ahead, fast-paced, and easy to play right out of the box. <P>The game looks great too, with a simple interface, multiple map views at the touch of a button, and terrain that looks great onscreen, even if it doesn\'t affect play in any way. Video is kept to a minimum in the Classic Risk version of the game, only appearing when individual opponents are completely wiped out or the world is completely dominated. The only visual shortcoming is in the size of the main map\'s view. All actions, troop movements, and invasions occur while only roughly 20 percent of the world is visible. Sure, complete world maps are only a triangle button away, but you can\'t perform any actions while looking at them. It would be easier to make small-scale tactical decisions if the large-scale strategic concepts were always visible. The game also features impressive military music that perfectly sets the tone, a huge bashing sound whenever the dice are rolled, and a number of other sound effects whose tasteful brevity enhances the feel of the game without detracting from the mood of the original. <P>A number of options round out the game. Up to four players plus up to four CPU opponents may play at once. AI may be set from easy to hard, with a dramatic effect on gameplay. Blind Risk makes it impossible to see into enemy territory for troop counts. Ultimate Risk is an entirely different game and makes a stab at realistic turn-based strategy. Featuring random turn order, dramatic weather effects, and choice of combat formation, the game offers generals to wield, forts and capitals to erect, and a much more realistic set of attack routing options that deflate the strategic importance of certain territories. In Classic Risk, there are only three ways in to the Americas, making those three territories the linchpin of strategy in the Western Hemisphere. In Ultimate Risk, piling all your armies in a few places doesn\'t make you safe. While all this is much more realistic, the new options bog down the speed of the original. Most folks looking for this level of strategy should probably cut to the chase and pick up Command & Conquer instead. <P>Hasbro Interactive has provided a near-perfect translation from the board game to the PlayStation. It has managed to preserve the style of play perfectly, without adding too many annoying new features to distract from Risk\'s sublime simplicity and speed. You won\'t lose the little plastic pieces, and your dog won\'t eat the cards. Plus, next time you feel like sweeping across Europe, but are worried that it\'s a little premature, you can save your game before you ""risk"" it. Perhaps they should have called the PlayStation version ""Less Risk."" --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Monopoly,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['PlayStation ~ Monopoly', 'How many times have you sat with your family after Thanksgiving dinner, digesting turkey over your hotels on Boardwalk and Park Place, thinking, ""If only there were a PlayStation version of Monopoly, I could play by myself and at the end of the four hours, the AI wouldn\'t be nearly as drunk as Uncle Jim?"" Okay, unless you\'re a true Monopoly fanatic (if there is such a thing), probably never. Nonetheless, Hasbro Interactive has ported the ancient game of ruthless real-estate wheeling-and-dealing from the board game world to the PlayStation. The result is successful as a novelty, though it poses little threat to bankrupt the board-game industry. <P>Anyone not already familiar with the original Parker Brothers game will probably not bother with the PlayStation version. Nonetheless, the gist of the game is as follows: roll the dice and circle the board, buying or trading properties, building houses and hotels, and charging rent when your opponents land on them, in an attempt to bankrupt them. The more expensive a property is to buy and to build on, the more rent you can charge (or be charged) for landing on it. Oddly, players are also trying to stay out of jail (for crimes unknown). Once there, they attempt to get out without paying their bail. It works just the same on the PlayStation. <P>Remember handling all those little, plastic roman numerals in Risk? As with so many classic board games, much of the pleasure in playing Monopoly is derived from the nostalgic familiarity of the game\'s physical components. Designers Gremlin Interactive imbued the PlayStation version with near-perfect simulations of those elements. From the look of the board itself; to the thimbles, top hats, and statues used as pieces; to the deeds\' precise color and typeface, the utmost care has been taken to preserve the game\'s familiar image. <P>Unfortunately, the designers have omitted much critical information from the player\'s immediate view. For instance, you see neither your nor your opponents\' properties unless you enter a special Trading Screen. As a result, you never know which numbers you must roll to avoid landing on enemy turf. In any game involving dice, half the fun is in trying to will the dice to land on the numbers you want, and the lack of an immediate visual reference puts a real crimp in any such telekinesis. It also severely reduces the potential for gloating over one\'s affluence, as the extremes of pride and avarice that make Monopoly worth playing are sadly exiled to the Trading Screen. <P>Many important dealings go on in the game without adequate mention, let alone the fanfare they really deserve. When houses go up, they just appear onscreen. When AI players are low on cash and forced to sell back houses or mortgage properties, all that appears onscreen is the anticlimactic message ""AI Player has raised cash."" For such a crushing blow, this is hardly the kind of squirming required for true robber-baron-style fun. You can\'t even tell which properties are mortgaged as you move across the board - a critical piece of information since mortgaged properties are ""safe,"" that is, if you land on them, you aren\'t required to pay rent to the owner. That oversight, combined with no visual evidence of who owns which properties in the first place, removes any real sense of peril from the act of taking your turn. In the original version, by the end of the game, the board felt like a mine field of potential financial ruin. <P>The Gremlin Interactive designers managed to make the PlayStation version look and feel just like the original Monopoly. They even threw in some cute computer animations of thimbles and statues driving around the board.

The Next Tetris,,['Challenging update of the classic arcade game'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""It seems as if the world's fascination with the Russian-created puzzle game <I>Tetris</I> will never end. Hasbro Interactive and Atari have introduced yet another challenging version of the shape- shifting classic <I>Tetris</I>. The new format follows rules similar to the classic game. However, there are now new objects (sticky blocks and cascades) to contend with. The sticky blocks add a clever twist to the action, since they connect themselves to other pieces of the same color when placed next to one another. These resulting sticky blocks are bigger and less mobile than regular blocks. As in the original <I>Tetris</I>, clearing a line of blocks will often result in a chain reaction that can cause other blocks to fall. At this point, the game can get quite frantic since these blocks often end up creating matches that trigger more chain reactions. It's a dizzying experience--but that's the charm of the game."", 'Players can choose from marathon mode (a single-player sequential game), two-player competition, or puzzle-style levels that require you to clear prepositioned blocks in a certain amount of time. The new elements make this updated game more challenging than the original, yet <I>The Next Tetris</I> retains all the charm of the game that started it all.

Know how to defeat all your friends? Know exactly where each block should go the second it touches the screen? Well, forget all that and throw it out the window. The Next Tetris is here, and you\'re going to have to unlearn everything you know. This is the game\'s most appealing feature, but also its biggest flaw. <P>Unlike previous incarnations of the Tetris brand, there is a definite end to each stage in The Next Tetris. The game places blocks on your screen at the start of the match and it\'s your objective to clear them off. This held my attention at first, but after a few minutes I was simply aching to go back to Tetris on the Game Boy Color - it just didn\'t feel right to only clear boards. Tetris has always been about seeing how long you can last. <P>Then I discovered how to make use of the new multicolored Next Tetris blocks. Now this was a game. <P>This is where you\'ll have a whole new game of Tetris to master - I played the game every single night for about a week, and I still didn\'t come close to figuring out exactly how to place each block. But the block placements I did come to understand really left me with a feeling of accomplishment. So it\'s not the old-style Tetris we\'ve known over the years, but The Next Tetris manages to become a fun game in its own right. Kudos to Blue Planet Software for coming up with this new spice for the Tetris formula. <P>Where The Next Tetris - and basically any Tetris, for that matter - really excels is in its two-player game. The ""first one to clear the blocks wins"" formula makes for great rivalry and is quite addicting. But here\'s where I noticed how one really has to relearn Tetris strategies. Instead of attempting to make sure there are no gaps in your lining of blocks (as you\'ve been trained to do from past Tetris games), in the Next Tetris it\'s OK to have gaps - often, they cause big chain reactions when blocks fall. Also, performing a Tetris (clearing four blocks at one time), the biggest accomplishment in past Tetris versus modes, does nothing more than shake your opponent\'s screen in this version. These new features definitely take some getting used to. <P>Tetris has never been about advanced graphics, so when I say that The Next Tetris\' graphics look pretty generic it should come as no surprise. There\'s nothing wrong with how the game looks, but there\'s nothing really new or extraordinary to be found here. The blocks, which are polygonal so they can stretch and shake, are quite cool though. Aurally, the game does the job as well. The soundtrack is mostly upbeat techno that includes several remixes of past Tetris anthems. My only gripe is that I wish there were more tracks. I\'m not sick of the six or so tunes yet, but give me a few more weeks of playing and I\'ll surely start switching over to my CD player for audio. <P>I\'d recommend this game to anyone looking for a new Tetris fix - it\'s definitely different enough from the other versions to warrant a purchase. Once you discover the beauty of The Next Tetris\' new block system, you\'ll immediately become hooked. But again, be warned - this is not the old-school Tetris you\'ve gotten used to over the years. I suppose many people will be glad to hear that, though... It\'s time for something new. --Sam Kennedy <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Space Invaders N64,,['Nintendo 64 game'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['small sticker on front and sticker on back label', ""The year was 1978. A simple, black-and-white game came out that would set the standard for shooters for years to come. That game was Space Invaders. Not only did it spawn a few sequels of its own (including a pinball machine), but other game makers quickly cloned it and made improvements to its gameplay. Activision is continuing its big retro kick with an updated version of Taito's classic. But can a game as simple as this succeed in today's market? (Hint: The answer isn't yes.) This new version of Space Invaders follows the basic concept of the old versions: Rows of small alien ships move from side to side across the screen. The ships drop down a row every time they reach either edge of the screen. If they land, you die. If they shoot you, you die. While the original Space Invaders stuck to this one type of level, later games - like the arcade game Super Space Invaders '91 - added weapon power-ups, shields, different types of alien ships, bonus stages, and bosses into the mix. Activision's game follows SSI '91's lead very closely. It also tries to inject a bit more plot into the game via opening and closing cutscenes. Also, the game takes you from the outer outposts of Pluto all the way back to Earth. Each planet has ten levels, the last of which is a boss level. A new alien ship is introduced in each world. Some of them shoot diagonally, some of them you must hit twice to kill, and some dive at you after they've been hit. The power-up system works off these different aliens. To earn a special shot, you must hit four of the same aliens in a row. Each alien type delivers a different special shot. This gives the game an almost puzzle-game-type feel at times, since you'll want to earn a special shot, then use it to kill four more aliens, which will give you another special shot, and so on. The game's biggest problem is its lack of difficulty. Anyone with a bit of shooter skill should be able to whip through the entire game in less than 90 minutes. The bosses are occasionally difficult, but you'll have built up so many extra lives by that point that it won't really matter. The original Space Invaders is also hidden in the game. The graphics are quite boring, and they don't really give the game a retro feel at all. Other than one of the end-level bosses, which was taken from the original Space Invaders cabinet art, none of the design in the game bears any resemblance to the original game. Also, the music and sound don't have any ties to the original thumping noise of the 1978 classic.  Space Invaders is a game different enough to cancel any feelings of nostalgia, yet it isn't good enough to stand on its own. If classic games are what you're after, get a pack of classic games, or better yet, find a big arcade that still cares about the old stuff. This pretender is no substitute for the original.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Delta Force - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""At first glance, NovaLogic's Delta Force doesn't look like the sort of action game you might expect to see here at the tail end of 1998. After all, a game in this genre has to be 3D accelerated to be good, right? Not necessarily. If ever there was a game that proved the value of gameplay over graphics, it's Delta Force."", 'Delta Force is a game of special forces combat against terrorist and insurgent forces. You can play the game from either a first- or third-person viewpoint. You can even do both at the same time, thanks to the picture-in-picture feature that lets you see your first-person view in a small window while playing the game from a third-person POV.', 'Delta Force includes five single-player campaigns, each against a different foe in a different theater: a drug lord in Peru, terrorists in Chad, terrorists in Indonesia, insurgents in Uzbekistan, and more terrorists on the Russian island of Novaya Zemlya. The foliage (which is universally sparse), the buildings, and the bad guys all vary from region to region, though the landscapes are all pretty much the same except for color changes (green for jungle, tan for the desert, white for the snowy arctic circle, and so on). Rolling hills and plains pitted by deep, smooth canyons are pretty much the standard terrain type here.', 'The attack-and-destroy missions are interspersed with a healthy number of other scenarios. For example, there are a few missions where you will have to infiltrate a base to steal a laptop or some other source of intelligence data. Others include rescue missions, convoy ambushes, and (in one of my favorites) laser-designating targets for naval bombardment. Overall, the mission design in Delta Force is very strong.', 'One point where Delta Force could stand some improvement, however, is in the mission-planning phase. As mentioned earlier, you have no say in the mission plan itself. You can alter your starting equipment and weaponry, but the mission waypoints are fixed - and suicidal. Nearly every mission is planned out so that your first dozen or so steps will take you straight into the heart of heavy, concentrated enemy fire. The best way to complete most missions is to ignore the waypoints entirely and make your way slowly around the objective, sniping all visible bad guys from extreme range before moving in to mop up the survivors.', ""Then again, the computer-controlled good guys aren't often much help anyway (particularly Charlie Team, which was about as useful as red shirts in Star Trek). For some reason, these poor fools got wiped out early in almost every single mission, often before I could even make it to my first few waypoints (maybe that's why they wouldn't leave their hole on the last mission). The AI for enemy troops, on the other hand, is quite good. Unlike in Rainbow Six, a bad guy in Delta Force will most certainly respond when you blow away his buddy - and so will a dozen or so of his comrades. Opening up with an automatic weapon from an unprotected spot is sheer suicide, as the bad guys will quickly home in on your stream of fire and wipe you out."", ""The tepid graphics engine does not ruin this game. So long as you have the hardware to run it at 640x480 with 16 million colors (the aforementioned Pentium II 300 can do this just fine), Delta Force can actually be quite impressive from a visual standpoint. The maps are all very well designed, as are the various bases, airfields, and other objectives you'll encounter. The player and enemy animations are excellent and realistic. The death animations even vary depending on where a character is shot. And the rolling terrain makes sniping a real challenge, as you often have to wait for a bad guy to pop up from behind a rise before pulling the trigger. The idea was to create believable outdoor environments where combat could take place at extreme ranges (we're talking about distances of up to a kilometer here), and Delta Force truly delivers in that respect."", 'The game\'s Dolby Pro Logic 3D positional sound and excellent sound effects make the battlefield even more realistic and immersive. The sound of bullets whizzing by is often the only indicator you have that you\'re under fire. When you hear slugs hitting the ground all around you, you know that it\'s time to move and move fast. Also, the shouts of your enemies (which come complete in a language native to the theater) will let you know whether or not you\'ve been spotted. Once, after shooting a Peruvian at point-blank range, I heard him yell ""Medico! Medico!"" before crumpling to the ground.', ""The weapon sound effects, from the suppressed H&amp;K MP5 to the mighty M249 SAW, are utterly fantastic - possibly the best I've ever heard. In multiplayer games, the weapon sounds of 32 players combine into an unforgettable din. When you enter a multiplayer game of Delta Force on NovaWorld, NovaLogic's free gaming service, you will feel like you're entering a real combat zone."", ""In general, multiplayer games of Delta Force are incredibly fun - when they work. NovaWorld is very obviously lacking in the bandwidth department, and reports are flying all over the Net about difficulties getting this game to work well over modem and generic Internet links. Still, if you catch NovaWorld on a good day and at a good time, you're in for a treat. Delta Force online is one of the most enjoyable and thrilling multiplayer experiences I've ever had. Game variants like capture the flag, king of the hill, and team deathmatch are a real blast no matter how many players are in a game."", 'Delta Force is a very impressive game overall, despite the limitations of the graphics engine and the multiplayer flaws. The excellent single-player gameplay, the solid multiplayer component, and the incredibly immersive battlefield environment make for a truly impressive game. Any action fan who is open-minded enough to look past the graphics engine will see a game that easily ranks with Rainbow Six as one of the year\'s best ""alternative shooters.""

A series of progressively more difficult missions teaches the player to become proficient in using traditional army man weapons, including the M-16, sniper rifle, mortar, hand grenade, and bazooka. Unlike many multiweapon games, <i>Army Men: Sarge\'s Heroes</i> offers choices of firepower that aren\'t gratuitous. Each weapon has specific advantages and all of them are needed to complete the missions.

Just ask the green  plastic toy soldiers in <i>Army Men Sarge's Heroes</i>.

Six  multiplayer missions and a family mode allow players to recruit  freedom-fighting friends of all ranks.', ""The first game in 3DO's Army Men series for the console systems, Army Men 3D for the PlayStation, lacked a great deal of spit and polish but had enough going deep down to make you hope for a sequel, albeit one that was much improved. That sequel, Army Men: Sarge's Heroes, came out for the Nintendo 64 last year and has now arrived for the PlayStation, but not much, if anything, has been improved upon, and it contains even more problems. You once again take the role of Sarge, a soldier on the Green side of a world full of plastic army men. The Green are in a war against the Tan forces, who have recently begun importing terrible weapons from our own world, such as magnifying glasses, which they use to melt your men down to plastic puddles. Your mission is to gather your troops, a la John Belushi in The Blues Brothers, to create a unit capable of stopping them. Your arsenal is made up of weapons from Army Men 3D, such as a machine gun, a flamethrower, and grenades, with new additions like a sniper rifle and mines. The game camera in Army Men 3D's single-player mode was near perfect because it stuck right behind your back, but in Sarge's Heroes for the N64, it floated behind you, and when your character turned, it took a few seconds to catch up. You'd sneak around the corner of a barracks and confront an enemy, who would then fire on you immediately, only he wouldn't come into view for a few seconds. Luckily, the camera in the PlayStation version of AM:SA stays put right behind you, although it also zooms into the sky for dramatic effect at times. Another fix is that it's now very easy to strafe in the game - not having this option was one of the main complaints about the original Army Men 3D. Also, expected differences between the PlayStation and N64 versions, such as improved sound and CG movies between levels, are of course present.  You probably won't need to get close to too many troops though, since the autotargeting is set so you can pick off enemies situated in towers simply by firing in their general direction. That was in place in Army Men 3D, but you weren't really able to get away with just running around blasting opposing forces because you'd get eaten up by machine-gun fire. Now, while enemies still fall with one or two shots, your character is a lot tougher, and health-restoring power-ups can be found all over the place. One pitfall that you'll have to worry about though is that you'll stumble upon an odd patch of land where the collision detection has decided to go wonky, and while you are trying to unstick yourself, you might get mowed down by a machine gunner. This is a strange but real concern. Somehow the graphics in Army Men: Sarge's Heroes for the PlayStation have turned out worse than in the original game. Pop-up and fog are plentiful, the textures are repeated often, and the world generally looks very sparse and bland. Instances where you'll end up floating in midair or observe enemies walking through buildings are frequent. The sound effects are also similarly bad. Explosions, weapon fire, and your character's Duke Nukem-esque chatter all sound muffled, and the military-themed music is tinny. The multiplayer mode has been trimmed back to two players from the N64's four, taking any fun out of it. .  Those hoping for a more polished sequel to Army Men 3D will be disappointed to hear that this title is even more shoddily produced than the original and that it retains little of its embarrassing charm. Within minutes of playing Army Men: Sarge's Heroes, you will be surprised at what Sony will approve for final release these days.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

BattleTanx: Global Assault,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['In the <i>BattleTanx</i> universe, the year 2006 ushers in a nasty virus that wipes out nearly the entire female population, sending governments into a <i>Mars Needs Women</i>-style stockpiling of the remaining few. Once the craze hits a Pok&eacute;mon-level frenzy, countries begin waging the ultimate battle <i>for</i> the sexes. Nice storyline, 3DO. Luckily, the BattleTanx vehicle combat series focuses on unabashed action and only barely hints at its tacky premise, so please, read on.', ""<i>BattleTanx: Global Assault</i> retreads the well-received 1998 debut with new weapons, power-ups, and locations, and revamped graphics and effects. Gameplay is simple. Players take control of 12 different tanks, ranging from an air-gliding hover tank to super-armored monster tanks, and battle it out against computerized tanks or up to three other players in a variety of global cities. Part of the fun of the original game is the ability to destroy buildings, taken to a new level in <i>Global Assault</i> with a greater variety of destructible objects, including cars and street lamps. Power-ups and weapons abound, with cloaking abilities, turbo boosts, mines, and nuclear weapons providing devastatingly fun ways to turn enemies into big ol' twisted heaps of smoking metal."", ""The single-player game features seven different modes of play, including deathmatch and capture the flag variations. The very addictive, over-the-top fun of the debut's multiplayer mode returns with more frenzied and explosive butt-kicking. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", ""It's always frustrating to watch sequels make the same mistakes as their predecessors, but it happens often. Instances such as the weak camera from the original Croc showing up again in Croc 2 are surprisingly common. That said, 3DO's BattleTanx: Global Assault is remarkable because its developers clearly listened to all the complaints lodged against the first title and systematically corrected those problems in part two. While the end result isn't necessarily a flawless game, it's a title much improved over BattleTanx and far easier to recommend. <P>The premise of BattleTanx new and old was inspired by the plots from at least several apocalyptic '70s sci-fi films and novels. In this latest edition, you and your wife are safeguarding chieftains of a new civilization and have recently sired a child - a rarity in this future world, where most of the women have died due to a strange, if modestly generic plague. One of the other world leaders, a madwoman who controls most of Europe, has discovered that your son has telepathic powers (known as The Edge) similar to her own, and sets out to steal him from you before he develops fully. When her troops (they're all in tanks - everyone drives tanks in this game, just accept it) fail to kidnap him, she uses The Edge to take control of your forces, setting the three of you on the run. At that point, you pop into your trusty tank and fight the good fight once again. <P>OK, so obviously, unlike other aspects of the game, the original BattleTanx storyline wasn't criticized enough to warrant an upgrade, but enhancements do abound here. To begin with, not only are there almost twice as many levels, but they feel less cookie-cutter than before and offer more variety. You might play a few simple search-and-destroy missions back to back, but then they're followed up by one in which you have to guard a convoy or free allies from a prison. Your tank's turning ability has also been significantly upgraded. While it once took forever to bring your turret to bear on an enemy, it now shifts quickly with the treads following only shortly thereafter. The graphics? They're prettier too. <P>There are also new secondary weapons and power-ups, such as grenades, which can be thrown into fortified areas or bounced around corners to destroy heavy-gun emplacements; a plasma pulse that zooms around the screen until it finds a target; and a cloaking effect that renders you invisible after a Predator-style shimmer. And you're not the only one who gets to pick them up; you'll find the enemy tanks using them frequently, perhaps to your chagrin, but it at least adds to the game's challenge. No doubt about it though, the best weapon you have in your arsenal is The Edge, which initially only stuns opponents within close range, but then later allies them with you once your abilities have improved.  <P>The game's whole life system has changed as well. Instead of having a set number of lives, you acquire tank bucks, which are used to buy different tanks. The basic Abrams tanks cost a standard amount of money, with the beefy Goliaths running twice as much, and the small quick rides running about half the price. How you want to spend your cash is up to you. There are more tanks to choose from in the sequel as well - from the Inferno, which sports a flamethrower, to the Marksman, which equips a laser you can use to snipe from a distance. <P>The multiplayer modes were the main attraction in the first title, but they seem to have fallen behind a little bit in the sequel. With frame rates getting faster and faster in the multiplayer sections of consoles games, the slow-moving tanks no longer seem to get the thematic break they once used to get. Even the fastest vehicle in this game has nothing on a basic grunt from Quake II's multiplayer. The variety of tanks, weapons, and stages helps out a lot throughout BT2's multiplayer deathmatch variations, but you'll skip over many of them for the Battlelord stages, where you must steal your opponents' queens and return them to your base, all the while defending your own matriarch. The two-player co-op mission, where you and a friend play the main game through a split-screen perspective, is also worth noting, and serves as a great addition to the series.  <P>It's true that the BattleTanx series' gameplay is essentially just a slower version of 989's Twisted Metal, yet it possesses a more strategic bent and a certain cheesy charm that, this time, is just enough to win you over. Playing BattleTanx: Global Assault will remind you of renting SNES and Genesis games that, while not scoring any high marks for technical merit, were simply fun to play. BT2's improvements over its forerunner, combined with its multiplayer options, nudge it out of the rental category and into that of a worthwhile buy. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

No  surprise to anyone that this game carries a Mature rating, so it's probably best to leave it in the box during  Johnny's 10th birthday party. But <i>South Park</i> fans are sure to fall in swee-e-et luv with this game. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", ""The Luv Shack is a little old place where we can get together. OK, now that the token B-52's reference is out of the way, South Park: Chef's Luv Shack is a loose combination of You Don't Know Jack-style trivia and Mario Party-style minigames. The result is a game that manages to amuse with its questions, but the lame minigames, lack of varied speech, and general slow pace of the game make it short-lived fun at best. The game is set up like a game show hosted by everyone's favorite chef, Chef. Chef offers the player in control a choice in three trivia categories. The categories manage to be pretty funny, with topics like Sucks or Canadian, Giant Japanese Monster Bad, The 1991 Denver Broncos, and West Siyeeeeede Story. The questions are occasionally funny (for instance: The rock band Loverboy: Sucks, or Canadian? The correct answer is, of course, both), but after two or three days you'll start to see some questions repeated. Speaking of repeating, the game's speech gets old pretty fast. It uses all the real voices, but there isn't enough variation. The game's intro is the same every time, the announcer says the same things, etc. A few different intros and quick jokes would have gone a long way here. Thankfully, the game moves at a pretty brisk pace, though I really could have done without the minigames. They break up the game's flow. The minigames are extremely basic, some taking on elements of classic arcade games like Asteroids, Warlords, Super Sprint, Tapper, and Kickman. Others are oriented toward button mashing. After seeing each of the minigames once, you'll probably wish there were a way to disable them altogether. The trivia and the game's warped sense of humor are the main draws here, and the minigames really take away from the overall presentation. Graphically, the game looks just as you would expect it to. The simple style of the South Park characters is well represented, and the animation closely mirrors the show, as well, even in the minigame rounds. This is a game that you may want to rent, but the repeating questions, repeating speech, and dull minigames keep it from being a game you'd want to pop in whenever you need a simple party-style game.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

This holiday season, you and your friends can put Sega\'s Dreamcast to shame with the [cough] best animation seen yet in a racer. Developed for the PC, the PlayStation, and the Nintendo 64, South Park Rally will take on Need for Speed 3 and Gran Turismo 2 as theracing game to play with buddies. Gamers get to race over and around (and likely through) the various South Park institutions, which fans of the show will instantly recognize. You can select more than twelve characters for a joyride through downtown South Park or the South Park forest, and each character has a vehicle that matches the driver\'s personality. Cartman whips around the competition in a 4x4 Sport Utility Vehicle; Grandpa defies geriatric physics in a rocket-propelled wheelchair; Chef dashes about in an ugly wood-paneled station wagon; Officer Barbrady jaunts around the town in the official South Park police cruiser; and Stan screams past opponents in his father\'s stolen hot rod.  <P>Early word from Tantalus Software indicates that South Park Rally is, naturally, based more on character interaction than on pure racing. When fighting, players can hurl weapons like chocolate salty balls at their opponents, or unleash the devastating Mexican Staring Frog. Acclaim\'s product manager Tom Bass won\'t release much information, but he did say that many of the multiplayer levels are cooperative, and that coordinated efforts will be necessary to see players through. He also added that the traditional notion of what a racing game is has been overlooked because South Park Rally is going for laughs. The title will feature levels based on traditional South Park festivities, such as Christmas and the infamous Cow Days. <P>Matt Stone, Trey Parker, and Isaac Hayes have selflessly volunteered to record original sound bites for the new title so that all the more players will find themselves being drawn into the colorful, carefree world that is South Park. As in South Park: Chef\'s Luv Shack, game boxes will display labels indicating the rather ""irreverent"" nature of Acclaim\'s latest production. Whether this will diminish or boost sales is anyone\'s guess.

Suikoden II,,['Amazing gameplay'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['GREAT condition, includes jewel case and manual', ""Because the original Suikoden was one of the first PlayStation RPGs to grace the US shores, it garnered more attention than it deserved. Despite being a respectable enough RPG, Suikoden was a relatively shallow, quick-play RPG that was light on content and heavy on combat. Suikoden II addresses a number of the problems of the original Suikoden, and although it feels somewhat rehashed, it still holds its own nicely in today's cutthroat RPG market."", ""Suikoden II takes place several years after the first game's revolution, a time when the evil Highland empire is terrorizing the innocent, burning their villages by the handful to satisfy the bloodlust of the maniacal Prince Luca Blight. You hop into the medieval-styled britches of an idealistic young imperial rebel who is out to right the wrongs of the world. To help you defeat the evil prince, you'll have a bit of ancient magic and an army of friends. Sound familiar? Suikoden II's story mirrors that of many other RPGs, but it adds a few twists all its own for good measure. While RPG purists were disappointed by the lack of development of the first game's myriad characters, Suikoden II focuses fairly heavily on character development, preventing party members from turning into mere power-up satellites. The game still retains the quest to collect the 108 stars of destiny from the first game, but many of the characters serve more use than, say, welcoming the player to Toran Castle. The game's sense of scope is impressive, encompassing a huge world war and letting players build and staff their own castle."", ""Basic gameplay is very similar to that of the first game - your party can hold up to six of the game's many characters, each of whom has his own attacks, spells, etc. One of the cooler features of Suikoden's battles was the unite ability, which let two or more characters combine forces for a super attack. Suikoden II emphasizes these one-two attacks, giving players more of an incentive to experiment with new characters. Unlike those of some RPGs, Suikoden II's random encounters are quick and relatively painless - load time from the overworld or dungeon is almost nonexistent, and characters usually attack all at once, preventing the game's battles from being too big of an annoyance when one simply wants to advance the story. Magic, gained from rune crystals found throughout the world and in stores, earns experience similar to Final Fantasy VII's materia system, opening up more spells as you advance. Suikoden II doesn't use magic points; instead, it gives you a set number of uses for each spell per outing, making it one of the least magic-intensive RPGs on the market, another welcome break from the current trend."", ""As was the case with its predecessor, it feels as though an international conflict just can't be fully realized in Suikoden II without some large-scale battles. Instead of the strategy-free battle scenarios of the original, Suikoden II adds an actual strategic element to the game's battles. The end result can easily be likened to the TurboGrafx-16's classic, Military Madness - you position your units on a map and tell them to attack enemy units, defend, or use magic. These scenarios are far more interesting than the almost instantly winnable scenarios in Suikoden, but they still don't amount to much more than filler minigames, and many victories and defeats are determined by the game's story alone. While it's a minor point, some players will think they're winning and but then be forced to withdraw because of some random story event."", ""Aesthetically, Suikoden II is a few notches above its predecessor. The graphics are displayed in a noticeably crisper resolution than its predecessor. The game's town and overworld are entirely 2D and sprite-driven, while the battle engine combines polygonal terrain and spell effects with 2D characters. Brief CG cutscenes are sprinkled throughout the game, as well, bringing a little more life to scenes that just wouldn't have carried the same impact with simple 2D spritery. Nice hand-drawn portraits are shown for all the game's notable characters, as well. Even though the overworld graphics are beyond bland, the overall effect is an appealing one. The game, despite increased graphical detail, has little to no load time to speak of once you're in the game, an always welcome bonus. Suikoden II's sound is on par with the original's, sporting well-instrumented RPG fare, occasionally flaunting a vocal twist. The game's sound effects are nice and crisp, containing actual digital samples instead of the screechy synth noises of even Square's most expensive endeavors. The game's translation fares far better than the first title's did, overall. However, the competent text was obviously rushed through proofreading, marring what would otherwise have been a perfect translation. Fortunately, other than the text, nothing has been localized for the US version - characters actually drink alcohol, not soup or coffee, as many characters were forced to drink due to the heavy-handed censors of the Nintendo era."", 'Fans of the first Suikoden game will love the sequel - it improves on everything that had made the first game memorable.

Fans of the show will encounter the entire  <i>Rugrats</i> gang, including Tommy, Angelica, Phil and Lil, Chuckie, Stu, Spike, and  Grandpa. Your goal is to seek and find pieces of Tommy's lost Reptar puzzle, which are  scattered across 10 basic and 6 bonus levels.

Other cool  adventure areas include an egg hunt, a circus, and a game of miniature golf with  windmills and uneven greens."", ""As in the cartoon, the game's graphics are relatively simplistic. However, the camera  angles do get a bit dicey at times, since the kids' big heads can often block your view of  the action. In addition, the frequently shifting perspectives sometimes result in a sudden  reversal of your control response, which can be frustrating during time-sensitive  moments. Nonetheless, this 1999 winner of the Parents Choice Award for the 4- to  10-year-old category is a great way for parents and their young children to play together.  <I>--Kasty Thomas</I>"", '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Kid-friendly gameplay</li> <li>Based on the animated hit TV series</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Camera angle problems can hinder gameplay</li> </ul>', 'Based on the Nickelodeon animated film and cable TV series, Rugrats follows the exploits of several boys and girls who are knee high to a grasshopper and likely able to do serious damage to one or both of your ankles. Yeah, it\'s a kids\' game. Let\'s get that straight early on. If you\'re any older than ten years, you\'ll be unable to keep from repeating the line ""Dude, this game is easy"" over and over again while at play. <P>In a kind of suburban take on Super Mario 64\'s castle hub, Rugrats is composed of a series of minigame levels accessed through spots found around your family home. The end goal is to recover all the pieces of your Reptar (or Godzilla, to you and me) puzzle, which you do by either beating the minigames or picking up enough bonuses to trade in for a piece. The levels see you hunting down Easter eggs, blasting shadow monsters with a flashlight, keeping chocolate milk away from your older sister, retrieving your grandpa\'s false teeth from a goose, and other similar adventures. Once that\'s all over (and after the cool ""surprise"" ending), there\'s a single- or multiplayer miniature golf game, which is fairly infectious.  <P>And that\'s Rugrats. It\'s not like most games said to be for kids (this is often a label slapped on a title when the gameplay is really simple or awfully repetitive) in that it\'s not bad. It actually seems like a good game for a younger audience. The shifting camera angles can be a bit nausea inducing at times, but that\'s its only real wart.

Goemon's Great Adventure is more of a Tomba-styled side-scroller that marries classic platform action with minor role-playing elements. While the game seems a little quirky and very Japanese, traditional side-scrolling-platform game fans will undoubtedly enjoy this Goemon. <P>The premise is that the all-knowing ancient has built a machine that brings people from the past into the present. Unfortunately, this invention is stolen by a thief who uses it to unleash a torrent of ghosts and goblins on the unknowing world, leaving it up to Goemon and his crew to retrieve the machine and put a stop to the bad spirits. <P>You can select two characters at the game's outset. Goemon, Ebisumaru, and two more characters become playable farther in. The first character you'll meet up with is a male ninja by the name of Sasuke, while the second is a female ninja named Yae, who can transform into a mermaid. Each character has his own type of striking weapon, projectile, and special attack.  <P>The gameplay mostly consists of traditional 2D run-to-the right/hit-the-enemy/platform-jumping action. Once you complete a level, you can progress to the next one, although to gain access to the final level in each stage you must have enough entry passes, which you gain by beating levels and completing side quests. The characters in the various towns you come across will set you on the side quests, which are often made up of simple tasks like going back to the level you just cleared and finding a few items before the timer runs out. The towns also let you swap characters, visit a general store to replenish supplies, check into an inn where you can rest, or see a fortune-teller from whom you can obtain secret info. The towns are filled with people who have something to tell you - most of what they say is inconsequential, but some shed light on the game story.  <P>One of the best parts of the game is its two-player cooperative-play mode. You can play the game with two people on the screen at the same time. More experienced players can actually help out others by piggybacking them through the course of the more difficult jump stages. When piggybacking, the player who isn't jumping and controlling the action gets to shoot projectiles. <P>Some of the game's bosses are incredibly easy to beat but look rather impressive. In fact, in the final level of a stage, Goemon's Great Adventure transforms into a first-person giant-robot fighting game. You can shoot, punch, kick, and block the enemy robot's attack. When the action gets too hot, you can tag out with another robot; when playing a two-player game the second player controls this robot.  <P>In the end, Goemon's Great Adventure isn't a visually stunning game that will wow anyone, but it is incredibly fun. Goemon fans will particularly like the characters and story, and platform game aficionados will just plain enjoy it. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

WWF Wrestlemania 2000,,['as shown'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"[""For those of you who've never even considered ordering a pay-per-view wrestling event or are appalled by the sight of steroid-fueled monster-men in a ring, this video game title is not for you. Still here? Then get ready for more ferocious virtual wrestling action, this time from WWF's corner of the ring. Brought to you by the brutes behind the highly-acclaimed <i>WCW/nWo Revenge</i> (considered by many to be the best wrestling game to date), <i>WWF: Wrestlemania 2000</i> throws into the ring over 50 World Wrestling Federation stars, each boasting his favorite moves and very distinct personality."", 'This one\'s got it all: awesome graphics, tons of characters and special moves, plenty of match varieties, and special touches like upgraded ring entrances. Pick a wrestler from the lineup or create a wrestler from scratch, choosing his appearance, taunts, and mannerisms. Then jump into the ring and show off your character\'s signature moves--from X-Pac\'s bronco buster to Chyna\'s ""ooh-that\'s-gotta-hurt"" low blow. With tag team, cage, and weapons matches, the action gets downright wicked. Players can even follow the Road to Wrestlemania, a story mode in which wrestlers grapple with the reality of competing week after week in special TV events in order to compete in the ultimate event, Wrestlemania 2000. No doubt that this game could likely be the champion of the ever-growing pack of wrestling titles. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>', 'THQ has been making WCW-licensed wrestling games for years. But a licensing shake-up has enabled the company to score the coveted WWF license that Acclaim held for years. THQ has a tremendous opportunity here to try something new with the license, and from the looks of the company\'s upcoming PlayStation title, WWF Smackdown, we may see something new yet. However, the company\'s first product, WWF Wrestlemania 2000 for the N64, is little more than a slightly upgraded version of WCW/NWO Revenge with a new set of wrestlers. So wrestling fans who are waiting for an all-new experience will have to keep on waiting. But WWF fans who skipped THQ\'s WCW games purely because of its license will be in for a game that plays well but captures only fleeting bits of the ""attitude"" that makes the WWF so popular. Additions to the engine include a sitting position for fallen enemies. You can pick wrestlers up off the mat and place them in a sitting position, or you can pick them up and put them on their feet. An in-depth create-a-wrestler mode has been added. But unlike WWF Attitude, the depth isn\'t found in how many different colors of pants you can put on your wrestler or how many different types of mullets you can slap onto your wrestler\'s head; rather, the draw here is that you can customize every single move. Want up and the A button from a weak grapple to be a backhand slap? Go for it. Want your wrestler to finish other wrestlers with the ""Insider\'s Edge,"" a rip-off of Scott Hall\'s Outsider\'s Edge? It\'s all you. A few other WCW finishers and taunts have made it into the game as well, so you can slap Scott Steiner\'s or DDP\'s taunt onto your wrestler if you so desire. Portions of the ring entrance walk are also customizable, as are things like ring entrance attire (hats, microphones, and water bottles are all available). You can set who your wrestler\'s rivals are, whom he walks to the ring with, how he reacts when and if he starts bleeding during a fight, and lots more. Digitized music and stills from the superstars\' video packages pepper the ring entrances, but both manage to detract from the experience rather than add to it. In theory, they make the introsmuch closer to reality than WCW/NWO Revenge\'s weak intros, but the quality of the entrance music is abysmal. Imagine a friend calling you up and playing entrance music over the phone - or perhaps a RealAudio file encoded at the lowest possible setting - and you\'ll be on the right track. The entrance ""video"" is similarly pathetic. It\'s a collage of still shots taken from the video intros, but the shots are taken at a very low resolution and blown up to fill the entire screen. It\'s a blocky, pixilated mess. You would think the developers would have splurged for a larger cart to make room for some higher-quality audio and video in the game. At least the wrestlers actually walking to the ring look better than those in Revenge did. Wrestlers come down the aisle with their managers, valets, or other companions. So, to answer the burning question, yes, Godfather comes to the ring with one of his hos. If you\'ve played Revenge, you already know exactly what to expect from Wrestlemania 2000. The game still uses the same grapple system, though it\'s a bit more reversal-friendly. The game is very easy to pick up and learn, but it takes a sense of timing to excel at the game. This makes it a wonderful multiplayer game. Playing alone, you\'ll be able to embark on the Road to Wrestlemania, the game\'s quest mode. Here, you\'ll pick a wrestler and his partner and fight your way through various WWF television shows, including Raw, Heat, and pay-per-views. You\'ll be booked into all sorts of different matches, and if you seem to excel in tag-team matches with your preselected partner, you\'ll be thrown into more of those. Other modes include king of the ring, three-way match, royal rumble, tag-team match, and cage match. Tossing the huge cage into the mix causes a bit of slowdown, and the cage looks a little strange up close, but it\'s still a welcome addition. You can also create your own pay-per-view shows and belts. Belt creation is a neat idea, but since the wrestlers never actually wear the created belts, you\'re limited to looking at a way-too-blurry picture of a belt before the match begins. Along with from the previously mentioned terrible digitized ring entrance music, the rest of the sound is really quite bad. The weak MIDI tracks that made up Revenge\'s entire soundtrack have returned, playing on menu screens and during matches. There\'s no speech or commentary in the game whatsoever. The sounds of people hitting each other and people bouncing off the mat sound pretty good, but this goodness is overshadowed by the rest of the game\'s weak sound. Graphically, the game improves upon Revenge, but the models are still blocky, and the textures used for faces, while more realistic than those in Revenge, just look weird. It\'s really strange to see The Rock\'s face frozen in the raised-eyebrow position while he wrestles. Also, most of the wrestlers\' heads are a little too square. The crowd is a collection of flat, sign-waving lunatics that get extremely tiresome after only a few minutes. WWF Wrestlemania 2000 does a lot of things right. It\'s got some good gameplay, though it may be a bit too simplistic for some. It improves on THQ\'s last N64 wrestling game by quite a lot, especially with the addition of a good create-a-wrestler mode. But the terrible sound, only passable graphics, and general lack of originality keep this title from reaching greatness. This engine has delivered some good games, but I think it\'s definitely time for an all-new engine.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

South Park Rally,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Take a wild tour of South Park, Colorado, in the most twisted rally racing  game this side of nowhere. Cruising through South Park Forest, downtown South Park,  and sites familiar from the TV show, racers forego the typical lap-to-lap racing style for a  treasure hunt-style game. All of your favorite <i>South Park</i> characters are joining in  the quest, including Cartman on his police tricycle and Chef in his station wagon.  Collecting a variety of items from various locations, racers have a number of tricks up  their sleeves to thwart fellow competitors. Mexican staring frogs, chocolate salty balls,  and Mr. Hanky, for example, inflict damage to competitors' vehicles in ways that are  better seen than explained."", 'Single racers are pitted against computerized opponents, while up to four players can  team up, go head-to-head, or race in challenge mode. <i>South Park Rally</i> carries a  ""Mature"" rating due to the fact that it\'s set in South Park\'s twisted little world. <i>--Eric  Twelker</i>', ""South Park fans have been let down time and time again by the poor quality of Acclaim's South Park titles. Unfortunately, South Park Rally, while easily the best of the South Park games, continues this losing streak with poor control and graphics. The story, as if this game really needs one, is that the good townsfolk of South Park commemorate every holiday by holding a go-cart event. These events range from simple races to events where one racer needs to hold on to an item for a certain length of time. For instance, on Valentine's Day everyone assembles at Big Gay Al's place to shoot one another with cupid arrows. The catch is that there's only one bow, making it a fight for control of the bow while trying not to get shot. Once you get the bow, you must get enough distance between yourself and the other drivers so you can get off a few shots without losing it. This setup makes the gameplay fast paced and even frantic at times. To help you fend off or prevent the other racers from passing you, the levels are filled with an arsenal of offensive and defensive objects. There are dogs, cats, and alien lasers, all of which can stall your opposition for a brief period of time. There are also little Terrance and Phillip boxes filled with gas, giving you a momentary speed boost. You can even pick up Mr. Hanky, who patrols around your vehicle, keeping you free from harm for a limited time.  The gameplay, while fairly fun, is hampered by poor control and physics that make the game hard to play. The biggest problem with the control is the vehicles' turning speed. If you get yourself in a tight situation where competitors are coming right at you, you might as well just take it head-on, since turning around takes forever. As does getting your vehicle back on its wheels after it flips, which happens a lot since the car physics are way too floaty, resulting in vehicles bouncing all over the place. Graphically, South Park Rally looks downright sloppy. The one exception is that all of the characters and their vehicles look pretty decent. The levels and objects on the levels, however, look poor and washed out. A copious amount of pop-up rounds out the depressing graphical presentation. The raunchy quips from the game's characters are funny at first, but they quickly become tiresome. In the end, South Park Rally's charm, even for the biggest South Park fan, wears thin fairly quickly - especially when compared with Crash Team Racing, a similar, yet nearly infinitely more entertaining PlayStation game. South Park fans may want to rent this game, but it's far too limited to consider for purchase.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

A game that redefined the way we imagine games and how we play them. As has been well documented, Metal Gear Solid is a game that focuses mainly on stealth. Stealth, as displayed by Solid Snake, is the greatest weapon you will have in the game. Haphazard gunfire and sloppy tactics will get you killed in this game. Period. If you want to make it out of this snowy hellhole in one piece, you\'d better learn when to act and when to stay still, and you\'d better learn quick. <P>What, then, is the point of Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions? Unlike the Japanese version (which released under the name MGS: Integral), the domestic version is not just a slightly updated version of the original game. The Japanese version only added the tuxedo from the original American release, along with a useless first-person perspective that was more trouble than it was worth. For the US version, MGS: VR Missions is essentially an extra disc, which, among other things, adds 300 additional VR missions for the stealthy gamers out there to occupy themselves with. That\'s right. At the risk of sounding like a used-car salesman, a staggering 300 VR missions awaits to test all of you who thought you were all that the first time around. Those of you who finish all these extra missions will be able to unlock special missions, such as ""mystery missions,"" where you must solve, um, mysteries, kind of like the Hardy Boys. You can also unlock bonus missions, where you can play as the ninja, which is particularly cool.  <P>The challenge level is fairly high, and it will take you a while to beat all 300 missions, which include nonweapon stealth missions, weapon missions, and more. Combined with the mystery modes and all the extra little things that MGS fans will appreciate, Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions gives you an extremely original collection of gaming goodness. <P>In addition to the extra VR missions is a photographic mode that, depending on your success and score in the regular game, will allow you increasingly closer access to the girls in the game. The higher your rating, the closer you can get to Mei Ling in a virtual photo shoot. Unfortunately, the photos still take up a shocking two memory card blocks each, making this a cost-prohibitive endeavor. However, if you\'re a budding stalkerazzi, then this may be the cherry on top. The game would have scored higher if it had come packed with the original game, but without it, it must simply be judged as an optional expansion pack for Metal Gear fans who crave a little more of that stealth action. Even so, with or without the original game, this is a worthy purchase for gamers who like a little meat with their potatoes. While it would have been a bit cooler as a complete set (but hey, you probably already own MGS, anyway), the VR missions belong in any MGS fan\'s library. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

You can manipulate matter at an atomic level--but so can your enemy. Find a way to conquer the enemy and end the threat to universal existence. Battle with realistic firing cannons and nukes on diverse terrain, including canyons and molten riverbeds. Total Annihilation challenges you to set a new standard for combat strategy.', 'The gaming industry is gearing up to bury consumers under an avalanche of real-time strategy games. Every developer is touting the one or two features that will help its game to ""redefine the genre"" - but the majority of these features do nothing but take away from the precarious balance which made the big two - Warcraft II and Command &amp; Conquer - such runaway hits. At first glance, Total Annihilation, with its much ballyhooed 3D terrain and more than ten dozen units, appears to be nothing more than another in a long line of real-time games with a few minor innovations. But in this case, the innovations work. Cavedog has done a commendable job of taking the basic mechanics of real-time strategy and using them to create something new: A game that relies less on constant mouse-clicking than careful planning and strategic thinking.', 'Initial impressions of Total Annihilation may be misleading. Fire up a campaign and the first few missions will seem like nothing more than another Command &amp; Conquer clone, albeit one with strikingly realistic terrain and a great symphonic score. But as you play deeper into the game, or play a few multiplayer battles or skirmish missions where your opponent is less forgiving, the complexities of the game begin to become apparent. Total Annihilation is a game about balance, from the tightly interwoven resource management scheme to the very diverse units.', ""It's hard to talk about one without the other, and resource management provides a great tightrope you must walk to keep the army strong, both in numbers and brute force. You need the two resources in the game (metal and energy) to power and build your units. Unfortunately, metal is usually rather scarce in the early parts of a mission (later you can salvage wreckage from destroyed units), but you can build generators to convert energy to metal. This solution to the metal shortage poses another problem entirely: Your units need energy to fire their weapons, and these generators use a great deal of power to produce a small amount of metal. Building a massive army of units is fine, but won't help you much if you don't have enough energy to keep them firing."", 'The units themselves - robotic mechs, vehicles, aircraft, and naval vessels - provide more to the balancing challenge. The stronger units are devastating but require a great deal of power and move very slowly. Large tanks and ships take a great deal of time to simply turn and fire at a target, and large bombers often must traverse the entire length of a map to turn around and make a second run. As a result, you must create balanced forces, small units to hold the enemy while the big guns ready themselves. There\'s no ""ultimate weapon"" like Red Alert\'s Mammoth Tank or Warcraft II\'s Ogre Magi - there are only more powerful weapons that have equally powerful disadvantages. And then there\'s the Commander, your strongest unit, your fastest builder and possessor of the devastating D-Gun that destroys units with a single shot. The Commander provides another great strategic conundrum - he\'s your best warrior, but it\'s risky to send him into battle because once the Commander\'s gone, the mission is over.', 'Total Annihilation is full of great features. The 3D terrain - pre-rendered maps with tall mountains and deep valleys - plays an important part in strategy, as units situated at higher elevations have a much wider firing range. Units can take cover behind trees, but these trees - and whole forests - can go up in flames with a single stray shot. When units are destroyed, complete with bass-heavy explosions and a slight shaking of the map, shrapnel flies everywhere, and structures and troops unlucky enough to be hit by the flying debris take damage, adding to the need for strategic placement - just standing and firing at the enemy will cause your units to get destroyed very quickly.', ""Your units gain experience, and with five kills they become veterans with much more accurate firing ability. You can also give units numerous commands at once (simply by holding down the shift key), so that minor tasks can be queued while you go off to worry about more important matters. These types of details make Total Annihilation great, and every time you play you'll discover some subtle little feature that makes you want to change your tactics and try something new."", ""There are a few small details that could have been improved. The opening missions of the Core campaign are set on a metallic backdrop that is somewhat confusing, making the area in your line of sight and grayed-out; invisible areas look very similar. The manual is a little on the skimpy side, and the lack of any tutorial to demonstrate the game's mechanics seems like an oversight, especially in a game where many players will bring tried-and-true real-time tactics, only to find they're almost completely useless. There's also the lack of a dedicated server for Internet play and the noticeable lack of a scenario editor. Finally, there's the Commander AI bug, which makes the enemy AI send his Commander into battle early on in skirmish missions, causing most to only last a few minutes (Cavedog has promised that a patch for this problem will be released shortly)."", ""But in the face of all that is right about Total Annihilation, these minor details are fairly easily overlooked. If you're looking for a real-time strategy game that adds some new features without breaking from the standard formula, Total Annihilation may be too foreign to satisfy your needs. But if you're looking for a game that is challenging and rewarding on entirely new levels, Total Annihilation is highly recommended. <i>--Ron Dulin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Now virtual farmers can relive the fun of the original in Nintendo 64's version, updated with beautiful 3-D graphics and a larger, more in-depth game world."", ""As in the original, Grandpa bailed on the old, neglected farm, leaving the player with the daunting task of making a living off the land, finding a wife and living happily ever after. (Did we mention that it's a challenging game?) Players first clear land for crops, venture to town for seed, tools, and farm animals, and cozy up to the town's five eligible women in hopes of making a love connection."", ""Much more than a plant-and-wait style game, various side quests keep players busy while the crops grow. The village is a socially active place, so mini-games pop up in the form of annual events, such as horse and dog races. In the winter, one can mine precious minerals or tackle an odd job here and there to keep food on the table and wood in the stove. With such a big, detailed game, you'll be playing until the cows... well, you get the idea. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", 'It\'s hard not to refer to a game that\'s completely lacking any sort of violence and wherein your main concerns are planting a farm, raising animals, and finding a wife as ""quirky."" But ""charming"" comes to mind in this case also. Natsume\'s Harvest Moon 64 begins with your grandfather\'s wake. He\'s left you with a farm whose primary crops for the last few years have been weeds, large rocks, and tree stumps. You begin setting the ranch back on its feet by clearing the land and planting a modest staple of potatoes, radishes, and cabbage, but you have many tasks beyond this. You\'re going to need to acquire cows, sheep, and chickens if you\'re going to have anything to do over the long winter month (each season lasts thirty days). Your house requires additions such as a bathtub and a greenhouse, and your farm needs a flower garden if you\'re ever going to convince one of the women from the local village to marry you. Town events - such as harvest festivals, dances, horse and dog races, and group bridge-building - also demand your attention. And then, of course, you can always go fishing. It\'s as if the developer took every minigame that\'s ever appeared in an RPG, combined them, and made a game out of it. The gameplay itself revolves around a set of repetitive actions: You wake up in the morning, check the weather report, feed your animals, clear weeds, water your plants, harvest any new growth, and maybe you\'ll have enough time to stop by town before the shops close. With some exception, this occurs every day and can go on infinitely since there\'s no definitive end to the game. But it never quite gets as tedious as it may sound. You\'ll find yourself going into some strange alpha state where your only thoughts are on the tasks at hand (and maybe getting a new cow). It\'s very addictive, though not in the way that you\'ll be thinking about how you\'d rather be playing it when you\'re doing something else. It\'s just very hard to walk away from it when you are playing. You\'ll need to know what\'s going to happen the next day, and you\'ll tell your friends when you accomplish a goal. ""My cow had a calf!"" ""Eggplants!"" They\'ll shake their heads at you, but will soon understand once they sit down to watch and become transfixed by it, too. There are several areas in Harvest Moon 64 that could stand improvement. The soundtrack is made up of only a few basic songs that you\'ll hear more than you\'d prefer. Buildings drop out of the world when you visit an area where several structures appear onscreen at once. And you\'ll wish it were easier to line up your character with the plants when you\'re out watering the crops. But these problems don\'t do too much to get in the way of the game\'s charm though, since it\'s not the type of title that you expect a lot of flash and bang from. Though admittedly not for everyone, Harvest Moon 64 is a strangely compelling, original little game that makes hours melt away incomprehensibly.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

N2O: Nitrous Oxide,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Ever wondered what it feels like to ride around on the inside  of a disco ball? <I>N2O: Nitrous Oxide</I> offers a sickeningly  effective approximation, letting players pilot a Tunnel Runner ship  through levels that mainly consist of twisty tubes with psychedelic  light patterns flashing on the walls.', '<I>N2O</I> is one of those old-school games that left us shaking our  heads after our first pathetic attempt to successfully navigate the  tunnels. The enemies just seemed too fast and too numerous. After an  hour of practice we were in the fabled ""zone,"" anticipating the moves  of the enemy and effortlessly rotating around the tunnel walls as we  racked up higher and higher scores. As with most simplistic arcade  games of this type, <I>N2O</I> can get repetitive, but we found that it  was perfect for a quick arcade gaming fix. Most arcade action game fans  (especially those who remember <I>Tempest</I>) should find <I>N2O</I>\'s  decent graphics, numerous weapon power-ups, and adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack to their liking. <i>--T.&nbsp;Byrl Baker</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Nonstop, mindless action <li>Tight controls <li>Nice soundtrack </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Repetitive gameplay <li>Graphics can be a little sickening </ul>', ""N2O is a shooter in the same vein as Tempest and Nanotek Warrior. You pick from one of five ships, each of which has different turning and braking speeds, and shoot a bunch of eggs and bugs that travel through a large tube. While the graphics are decent, the only thing N2O truly has going for it is the soundtrack. <P>The gameplay is straight-up Tempest. You travel around the inside of a tube and shoot at everything in your way. If things get too hectic, you can slam on the brakes, stopping your forward movement for a few seconds, which should give you the time to clear a path. Once you've destroyed all the level's eggs, you progress on to the next tube. If it sounds basic, that's because it is. You just keep plodding on from tube to tube. Occasionally you'll face a boss to break up the monotony. At least the loading times are nearly nonexistent. <P>The graphics in N2O are about what you'd expect: a fast-moving polygonal tube textured with wildly colored cycling patterns, as well as polygonal enemies. The game has some pretty good lighting effects, as well. The game's soundtrack is provided by the Crystal Method. Many of the tracks were taken directly from their album, but there are a few remixes on the disc, too. The disc's audio is in redbook format, so you can pop it into any audio CD player and listen to the music. Normally this wouldn't be such a big deal, but since Fox seems so bent on pushing the game solely on the strength of its music, it's worth mentioning. <P>As a game, N2O is decent, but it really isn't worth purchasing. If you're really into the soundtrack, you'd be better off spending 15 bucks on the Crystal Method's album instead of spending ducats on N2O. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Croc 2,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['The original Croc was graphically impressive for its time because it showed that seamless 3D platform worlds were possible on the PlayStation (something Spyro did to a much greater degree a year later). It seemed to have all the elements in place to be a great title: a cute mascot with a bevy of different moves, and elements from all the major platform games. But two fatal flaws knocked it down: The gameplay was repetitive, and lack of camera control led to numerous frustrating, cheap deaths. <P>The sequel, however, no longer requires you to muddle through level after level with the same exact goals to accomplish (""Free the Gobbos""). In fact, there are no longer levels, at least not in the linear sense. You now enter hub areas where you accept missions from your weepy Gobbo friends (miniature tribble-like creatures that are always in need of help). Some of the quests are similar to minigames in other games, such as a short race against several opponents in speedboats. Other missions have you collecting lost items within large environments. Granted, ""Get the Sandwich"" isn\'t essentially much different from original\'s ""Free the Gobbos,"" but there\'s enough perceived variety so that the gameplay doesn\'t feel repetitive. And the hub setup lets you try out other missions without having to beat stages to progress. Another improvement is the basic inventory system, which lets you use items you find or buy, such as binoculars or high-jump Gummi Savers (hello, product placement) that let you access special areas. <P>Unfortunately, Croc 2 still uses the camera system that the first game did. Instead of being able to shift your perspective to the left and right using the L2 and R2 buttons (as in Spyro, Gex, and Kain), the camera eventually catches up to whichever way the character is facing. Since Croc usually takes a few steps when he turns, you\'ll often find yourself off a cliff or platform when you\'re trying to line up for a jump. It\'s hardly an ideal system for leaping across a series of collapsing platforms - unless they\'re all conveniently lined up in order. <P>It\'s also far too easy to get killed in Croc 2, perhaps even more so than in the original. Cheap deaths are everywhere due to the perspective problems, as well as the fact that health power-ups (or hearts) are far too few and far between. Falling into lava or similar hazards causes you to start up at the last checkpoint, which is all well and good except that you begin without any life energy. That thing that gave you trouble when you had a full life? Well, now you can try again with none at all.  <P>Instead of subscribing to the Super Mario 64 way of teaching players how to overcome obstacles (where the player learns new moves gradually along the way), the Croc series expects you to learn by dying, and since you frequently lose lives because of the camera, you get mixed messages, which leads to frustration and consequently to turning the game off. One bit of redemption comes in the form of those aforementioned side games in which you\'ll find yourself zipping through tunnels on a mine cart or flying through loops Prop Cycle-style without the cycle. While these new tricks hardly save the game, they do break up the morbid monotony of falling off platforms. All in all, if Croc 2 had learned its perspective lessons and it wasn\'t so easy to get killed in the game, it\'d end up at par with or perhaps even above games in the Crystal Dynamics\' Gex league. It held promise, but once again two fatal flaws hold it down. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Mortal Kombat 4,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""The Mortal Kombat series is one of the premier gaming series around today. The series, which until now utilized digitized actors to give the game an extra layer of realism, has been the topic of comic books, movies, action figures, and even Senate hearings. The fourth time around the game has gone polygonal, giving the developers much more leeway when it comes to adding new moves, holds, and characters. Also, weapons have been added into the mix, with each character possessing a different sword, club, or staff to beat his enemies with. <P>The storyline of MK4 picks up the loose ends left behind by both MK3 and MK Mythologies: Sub-Zero. With Shao Kahn defeated, Shinnok picks up the slack as the main bad guy. However, he is also a selectable character, which left arcade players with no big boss to look forward to. To remedy that, the home version contains MK1's four-armed bad boy, Goro. Goro looks terrific in 3D, moves very fluidly, and has all the great moves he had in MK1, as well as a few additional ones. He isn't selectable from the start, but he'll be available via a code. Returning characters include Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Sonya, and Raiden. Most of the old characters maintain their old moves and add a new one here and there. The new characters fit very well into the MK universe, a welcome change from most fighting game sequels. <P>The graphics of the PlayStation version aren't as good as the arcade version. That's pretty much a given. But they still look decent, make great use of light sourcing, and run at a very high speed. There are a few moments where the frame rate dips, but not enough to cause a problem with the gameplay. Also, the graphics aren't as good as the N64 version, which has smoother-looking characters. The music sounds very nice, and the game has all the speech from the arcade, except for the character names that are usually said when Shinnok does his impersonation moves. This causes a slight change in the gameplay since you won't know who Shinnok is impersonating until he does a special move. The intro and endings, which were done with the game engine on the N64 and in the arcade, have been completely redone and beautifully rendered. Most of them look really cool, although there are a few spots that could have used a little more work.The gameplay is very close to the arcade. Some of the fatalities in the game are much harder to do on a pad, as they require you to hit multiple buttons at the same time. The combo system has been greatly simplified. Each character can start a combo the same way, and some of the more damaging moves in the previous games (the uppercut, for instance) have been weakened. The introduction of weapons seems silly at first, but once you've played for a while and gotten used to using them, they really do add a new dimension to the game. Each character has two fatalities, and there are two stage fatalities. The fatalities look nice, but too many of them are merely 3D updates to old fatalities, and the new fatalities in MK4 simply aren't that great. It would have been nice to see some more innovation here. A few modes have been added to the game, including a practice mode, which shows all the characters' moves and fatalities. There are also three types of endurance fights, a team battle mode, and a tournament mode. A theater mode allows you to look at all the endings you've unlocked in arcade mode. <P>If you haven't liked any of the previous MK titles, MK4 probably won't win you over. But this is a good translation of a good arcade title, and fans of the arcade version won't be disappointed. However, if you're looking for some smoother graphics, and you own an N64, you may want to pick up that version instead. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Not a whole lot has changed in the 11 years between the two games. Sure, the graphics are better and the levels are larger, but at its core, World Tour is still the same old game. You still pick one of three monsters and blow up every building in sight. The only real difference is that this time there's a bit of a storyline attached to the madness. The game gets under way with the three characters being mutated into large monsters. Angry at the company that's producing this mutating goo, the monsters set out to destroy everything in their paths in hopes of destroying all the plants making this radioactive muck around the world. A slim story, yes, but more than enough for a game like Rampage. The graphics in Rampage World Tour are, of course, better than the original Rampage, yet they maintain the same look and feel. The game's sound (mostly explosions, air-raid sirens, and the like) also fits really well. The translation is nearly identical to the arcade version of World Tour. The gameplay also sticks to the original, although now your monster can kick, which makes destroying buildings and ground vehicles much easier. Perhaps even a bit too easy. And there are lots of new little tricks in the game, like bouncing off buildings, jumping onto planes, and more. The levels are now much bigger, and if you take too long, the citizens evacuate the town and call in the national guard. If you enjoyed Rampage in any of its previous incarnations, Rampage World Tour is probably worth picking up, but the game is incredibly repetitive and stupidly simple.

And now in Mortal Kombat Trilogy the entire Mortal Kombat series (and more) is on one disk. Die-hard fans will lose their heads over all-new moves, finishing techniques, and a new secret character - Chameleon. Players won\'t find any improvement in terms of control, graphics, or sound from the Playstation edition of MK3, but they will find a heck of a lot more game. <P>In addition to the plethora of great-looking backgrounds and digitized characters, Mortal Kombat Trilogy ups the ante in terms of options. Players can do more than simply adjust the level of difficulty and turn off the graphic violence mode; now they can select ""auto"" combos, which make those difficult multi-button attacks much easier to perform. Gone too is the long loading delay from MK3 and UMK3 when Shang Tsung, the morphing character, switches identity. In Mortal Kombat Trilogy, the console loads two additional characters into memory - this means Tsung can now morph without delay. This pre-loading feature gets even faster and deeper when players select characters who are palette swaps. (An example of a palette swap would be the human male ninja character, who takes the form of the blue Sub-Zero, the yellow Scorpion, the green Reptile, and others. In essence this is the same character, but with slightly different attributes.) The new secret character, Chameleon, takes full advantage of palette swapping, and constantly shifts among the human, male ninja character forms. His morphs are ingenious enough, however, that most players will welcome yet another ninja into the fold. <P>While there\'s little doubt that the Mortal Kombat series is the best 2D fighting-game property ever, there is a bottom line. That is to say, Mortal Kombat Trilogy should be seen as a bonus for loyal fans before Mortal Kombat steps into the 3D arena (in next year\'s MK4). For these fans, Mortal Kombat Trilogy offers enough added elements to justify purchasing it. However, the Mortal Kombat series does have to move to the next level quickly, or it will become a fatality itself. --Hugh Sterbakov <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

NFL Blitz,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""NFL Blitz is an arcade-style football game from the same team behind NBA Jam and NBA Hangtime. It packs the same punch as NBA Jam did when it was first released, with fast, loose gameplay that is as spectacular as it is addicting. While the PlayStation version is not arcade-perfect, it's close enough, with great gameplay and decent graphics. <P>NFL Blitz takes a few liberties with the rules of football. First of all, there are no penalties. You can dive into receivers long before the ball heads their way with no fear of getting called for pass interference. Secondly, it now takes 30 yards to get a first down. Given the scope and speed of this game, getting a first down every ten yards would have been far too easy. Also, the number of players on the field has been reduced to seven. There are 18 offensive plays and nine defensive plays, as well as plays for punting, a fake punt, field goals, and fake field goals. <P>The gameplay moves along very quickly once you've gotten a basic feel for things. The plays are pretty straightforward at first, though there are tons of different things you can do on each play, so as you play the game more and more, you'll figure out more and more little tricks. There are specialty moves like spins, dives, and stiff-arms, all of which will help you to gain more yardage when used appropriately. Pitting two players of the same skill level against each other turns the game into a strategic, nearly chess-like battle, while mismatched players can use the game's CPU assist, which helps people come from behind, keeping games close. Once you get reasonably good at the game, however, you'll want to disable the assistance and be judged purely on your own skill rather than rely on the cheap comebacks that the CPU assist provides. <P>The PlayStation does a good job of handling Blitz's graphics. It has been dropped from 60 frames per second to 30, and the field and players are significantly blockier, but the game runs at a very fast, very constant speed. The colors aren't quite as vibrant as the other versions of the game, but it still looks favorable. <P>Some extra speech that wasn't included in the arcade version has been added to this version, but you'd hardly notice. The speech is pretty random at times in terms of timeliness. Some phrases will be timed just right, but occasionally the announcer will announce the catch of a pass (or, in extreme cases, the throwing of one) after the play is already over. All the non-game music is intact, but the actual gameplay is without music. <P>The PlayStation version of NFL Blitz exposes Sony's NFL Xtreme as the cheap pretender it really is. If you're after arcade-style football, look no further than Blitz. It's easy enough to learn that even those of us that don't like sports games can easily get hooked. Blitz is the most addictive sports game ever created. Don't even rent Blitz. Just go buy it. You won't be sorry. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Many of the original elements have returned, such as lobbers, chests, food, monster generators, and Death, and there are still four basic character classics (warrior, valkyrie, magician, and archer), but now each has a different look and general power depending on what color scheme you choose for it. Red has a fiery barbarian theme, blue has an electrical energy about it and a royal air, green has a forest flavor and an acidic bite, and yellow has a sun-worshipping Egyptian feel.  <P>Each character also has a special move, or spell, which can be used once his powerbar has built up. New power-ups include three- and five-way shots, invulnerability, X-ray vision, and time stop, and can be built upon each other instead of canceling each other out. Characters build up experience and continue levels and use gold to buy strength, items, and the like at end-level shops.  <P>There are four main worlds to the game (mountain, castle, forest, and pyramid), followed up by two final boss levels. Each world is composed of five to six main levels and has one to two secret rooms each. The first of the two boss levels can't be opened until the bosses (dragon, chimera, djinn, and spider queen) from each of the four worlds are destroyed, and the second can't be accessed until 13 hidden runestones have been collected.  <P>New features for the console versions include additional player characters (one male and two female); new sound effects, enemies, worlds, and bosses; a storyline (told through CG sequences on the PlayStation); a 3D map function; and a deathmatch mode where players will beat each other up for points, treasure, and gear.

Not only can you use these plays at home, but you can take your controller pack to the arcade and plug it into the new game, NFL Blitz '99, and use them there as well. <P>The gameplay moves along very quickly once you've gotten a basic feel for things.

The game was dropped to 30 frames a second from the arcade's 60, and the field and players are a bit more blocky. The game still runs just about as fast, though, so the gameplay isn't hampered. Also, some of the zoomed-in scenes are plagued by slowdown, which also happened from time to time in the arcade, but here it is a bit more pronounced. <P>The arcade's rampant speech has been cut way back to fit on a cartridge, although the music has remained mostly intact. Also, a lot of the grunts and screams have been cut from the game, so you hear the same scream over and over again. Most people won't notice it, but if you played the arcade version a lot, the repeated scream quickly becomes annoying. <P>While the gameplay is mostly accurate when compared with the arcade versions, there are a few minor differences. Receivers are covered slightly differently, which sometimes results in your defender not being in the right position to break up a play. The computer plays you a bit tougher now, and the CPU assist kicks in much earlier and much harder. If it is down by a couple touchdowns, it will merely march upfield and score, leaving you little or nothing to do about it. Also, it will onside kick the ball to you if it is down late in the game. There are more dropped passes, and a few more fumbles, as well. The play editor allows you to do some pretty cool things, but the computer is easily fooled by the custom plays, and playing them against the computer isn't really an accurate way to test their effectiveness. <P>NFL Blitz is the best football game ever made. Unless you're one of those freaks that requires hyperrealism in every facet of your football games, there's no need to buy any other football game. Even if you're only playing against the CPU, the game is still extremely engrossing and more addictive than biting your nails.

You hopped around from platform to platform, making bad sitcom references along the way. The sequel drops Gex into a Mario 64 clone. While the game is technically proficient, the unbelievably lame speech and camera problems make Gex: Enter the Gecko a frustrating title at best. <P>The game starts by clueing you in to what Gex has been up to since defeating Rez - mostly sitting around and watching lots of TV. But like any good video game villain, Rez isn\'t done quite yet. The government tosses Gex a pile of cash, he makes a quick fart joke, and the stage is set for Gex\'s new challenge. <P>The graphics and frame rate in Gex 2 are quite good. It\'s about as close to Mario 64 as you\'ll ever get on a PlayStation. The worlds are big and fairly nonlinear, which leads to more than a little confusion as you wander the halls of haunted mansions, jump down rabbit holes, and bounce around the circuitry of a computer. A fair amount of pop-up is masked by fog and darkness. The sound effects are pretty good, but the speech simply drags the entire game down. Dana Gould, a genuinely funny stand-up comedian, deserves better. Instead, he\'s been reduced to making lame comments, several of them via a truly horrible Austin Powers impression. Once you\'ve heard Gex shout: ""It\'s tail time"" in about a hundred different intonations, you\'ll want to start shoving safety pins into your ears until you\'ve permanently damaged your hearing. I eventually wanted to beat my television with a bat. You can turn the commentary down or off, but considering that the game\'s entire selling point is based around these pathetic one-liners, you kind of feel obligated to leave them on. <P>The game also plays quite a bit like Mario 64. Each level has a number of remotes (read: stars) hidden in them. You pick a clue (just like Mario 64) and set out to find the remote described in the clue. There are also hidden remotes as well as a remote that is won by getting enough coin-like items in each world. Certain worlds require you to have a certain number of remotes before you can enter, just like - surprise - Mario 64. <P>Gex: Enter the Gecko should have been a much better game. They certainly jacked enough concepts from Mario 64 to warrant a good game, but the atmosphere surrounding the gameplay really brings it down.

The series' storyline was augmented through the MK movie, and to a lesser extent, the MK cartoon. Mortal Kombat Mythologies sets out to further enrich the series' plot by narrowing the focus down to one character. The first (hopefully of many) MKM game focuses on Sub-Zero, and it details his past with Scorpion and how he eventually came to be involved in the Mortal Kombat tournament. The story also sheds quite a bit of light on Midway's newest addition to the fighting series, MK4, specifically the new characters Quan Chi and Shinnok. <P>Basically, MKM plays like an MK game except that instead of fighting in the confines of an arena, you are free to run around and hop on platforms. The controls are identical to MK3, except that a button for picking up items and turning around has been added. Sub-Zero's MK3 combos remain intact. His special moves are also in there, but they must be earned through experience points. In the first level, you'll likely learn the ice blast and slide moves. Later on, Sub will gain the ice clone, a diagonal ice blast that freezes jumping enemies, a running ice move that freezes enemies on contact, and more.

Some of the later special moves take up nearly all your meter, so use them wisely. <P>The graphics in MKM look very washed out. The characters are large, but move jerkily. Some of the backgrounds look decent, but many of them appear very flat and, again, extremely washed out. The PlayStation version's FMV has been replaced with still photos and text, losing all of the PlayStation version's character in the process. The game's sound, in general, is pretty dull and muffled. The music in the Mortal Kombat series has always been terrific, but the N64 lacks the storage space required to render the PlayStation version's soundtrack effectively. <P>The game controls quite shoddily, which has come to be expected from an N64 game with any shred of a fighting-game-style setup. For a game that requires such precise jumping and fighting, the N64 controller simply isn't up to the task. <P>The game's perspective causes a few problems here and there. Shinnok's Bridge is a perfect example, as you're expected to make more than a few blind-faith jumps into the unknown in order to find a platform that is below the screen's line of sight. Also, the game is pretty short, relying on a set number of lives and continues to provide the game's extreme level of difficulty. This one is only for the hard-core MK fans who don't already own PlayStations. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Rush 2 Extreme Racing USA,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<I>Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA</I> is the follow-up to the popular arcade-turned-platform-game <I>San Francisco Rush</I>, offering the signature rambunctious gameplay of the original with several welcomed new features. No longer limited to zipping through the streets of San Francisco, drivers plow through express tours of Seattle, New York (uptown and midtown), Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Honolulu, among other tracks. An addictive new feature is a stunt track, where players rack up points by performing spectacular jumps, in-air spins, flips, and loops. Ever seen skaters frolicking about at a skateboard park? Think bigger park with frolicking one-ton vehicles. Not the prettiest sight, but so much fun.', 'Obviously, this is a far cry from the traditional auto racing game. <I>Rush 2</I> is an all-out, full-throttle action racer, with cars careening through shortcuts, performing gravity-defying leaps, and, occasionally, actually racing down the main track. One cool feature (and slight annoyance): collecting keys and cans of a trademarked hyper-caffeinated soft drink--carefully placed on the track by cunning marketing executives--opens new areas, offers new vehicles, and provides cheats. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Same out-of-control fun as the original, with new enhancements</li> <li>Great offering of new tracks, cars, and secret features</li> <li>Strong multiplayer appeal</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Graphics slightly outdated</li> <li>Sound best enjoyed at an imperceptible volume</li> </ul>', 'Driving games are often subcategorized between ""arcade"" and ""simulation,"" without the mutual exclusivity of one or the other. This is evident in the fact that even the most ardent sim-head can find appreciation in a quality arcade racer. Midway\'s popular San Francisco Rush series turned heads as a coin-op with its over-the-top jumps and urban ""Streets of San Francisco"" car antics. Sure, it was low on realism, but it was still a blast to race your buddies after a few drinks at the pool hall. Last year, Midway\'s release of San Francisco Rush for the Nintendo 64 was a pleasant surprise to fans and newcomers alike. The home version compensated for its toned-down graphics with secret paths and enhanced stunts and jumping techniques not found in its arcade counterpart. It became an instant classic for fans of San Francisco Rush. Like most everything else catered to the post-Generation X demographic, Midway\'s latest entry in the Rush series is appropriately subtitled Extreme Racing USA. Unfortunately, the only thing extreme about Rush 2 is its penchant to be extremely mediocre. For all the refinements and additions to the game engine, Rush 2 just doesn\'t live up to expectations. <P>Modes of play in Rush 2 remain almost identical to last year\'s San Francisco Rush. You can choose to compete in a single race or choose circuit mode, which runs the gamut of courses. Two-player split-screen mode makes a return in the sequel and allows both players to race against four CPU drivers (who usually end up as fodder for some spectacular accident or moving obstacles). Courses can now be mirrored or reversed during single-race or two-player modes to prolong the challenge. In some cases (such as the revamped Alcatraz track), this feature actually makes a difference - but it can\'t seem to save the uninspired track designs from their bland conception. The practice mode allows you to spend as much time as you want on any given track to perfect lap times or look for shortcuts to the finish line. And of course, records can be saved or referred to at any time with a Nintendo Controller Pak. For players without a Controller Pak, Rush 2 provides a password feature to continue the 28-track circuit without having to restart every time. <P>The biggest contribution to Rush 2 is the split-screen two-player stunt mode. It manages to capture the essence of the Rush series without masking it under the pretense that the Rush engine was built for anything other than pulling off massive jumps and hang time. This mode takes place on a sparse, almost grid-like track filled with ramps, bumps, moguls, launchers, half-pipes, and more. In stunt mode, you race through the immense level launching your car in the air for stunts and tricks. You compete to score the most amount of points within a five-minute period. Flipping through the air, catching exorbitant amounts of hang time, or driving on two wheels all score a variety of points, depending on the difficulty of the stunt and whether you actually land the car upright. The stunt mode is addictive and fun; especially in two-player mode where you are scrambling to rack up points before the timer reaches zero. In the end, you will need to judge for yourself just how much depth is involved in the stunt mode. While some skill is required in actually pulling off stunts, most of the aerial frolicking is random since you have no control over how the car behaves in midflight. After playing through Rush 2, most will agree that its stunt mode is one of the game\'s only redeeming qualities. <P>Rush 2\'s other game options include a wind setting, which affects hang time, as well as the difficulty in getting all four wheels back on the ground. Almost as a joke in bad taste against all other Nintendo 64 racers, Rush 2 has brought back the ""fog"" meter, which can increase or decrease your visibility on the tracks. Car selection and detailing has been greatly improved to the game\'s benefit. You can now choose from a wide variety of cars, each a slightly modified version of a vehicle in real life, as well as customize simplified components of the cars (for example, a slide bar chooses between acceleration or top speed). Altogether, there are more than 16 cars to choose from, with more to unlock as you progress through the game. Atari has made an extra effort to ensure that the car customization system plays an important role before each race. You are encouraged to switch from car to car, depending on the rigors of each track. On the gameplay and control side, Rush 2 feels a lot tighter than its predecessor, although with a Nintendo 64 analog stick, the controls are still far too sensitive to pull off any effective drifts. Additionally, quite a few of the new tracks in Rush 2 seem to emphasize racing rather than exploring, and this may come as a disappointment for all those who wanted bigger jumps and wackier routes. <P>While the quality of the graphics in Rush 2 haven\'t exactly gotten worse, they no longer stack up against those of other racers (even by 32-bit standards). Graphically, the game looks a lot like San Francisco Rush. Buildings and objects along the track are composed of simple cubes and boxes textured with windows and other low-resolution maps. The nine new track designs range from boring to slightly interesting, but everything seems to lack the aesthetic finesse that the game is so starved for. Most of the time, it feels as though you\'re driving through a beta-test copy of the game since there are numerous objects that populate the sides of tracks that appear to be untextured. The biggest improvement in graphics can be found on Rush 2\'s car models, which deform and change according to your location of impact. If you are willing to expand your notion of what makes for decent graphics on a driving game, then Rush 2\'s visuals should suffice. Again, most fans of the Rush series know what to expect in this department so any criticism here purely serves to disillusion the newcomer. --Chieh Chou <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Scumlabs International has made yet another mistake by messing  with nature, and now the ugly beasts of their science experiment are fighting back. This  time, new mutants Curtis the Mouse, Boris the Rhino, and Ruby the Lobster have to  obliterate numerous cities in order to rescue the original mutants (George, Ralph, and  Lizzy). Of course this wouldn't really be a universal tour unless you also defended the  earth from an alien attack.

Some even have recognizable landmarks in the background. Still,  this game is for extreme fans of the <I>Rampage</I> series, because everything else  remains exactly the way you remember it. <i>--Hugh Arnold</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Improved graphics</li> <li>Expanded cities</li> <li>Extended plot</li> <li>New mutants</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Easy, mindless game</li> </ul>', ""Rampage 2: Universal Tour is, in fact, the third game in the Rampage series. However, it does so little to distinguish itself from last year's Rampage World Tour that calling it Rampage 2 is somehow fitting. <P>In World Tour, you chose to play as Ralph (a giant wolfman), George (King Kong incarnate), or Lizzy (a gigantic lizard), the same three characters who had appeared in the original 1986 arcade game, simply known as Rampage. Universal Tour's story opens shortly after World Tour ends: Our three heroes have been captured, separated from one another, and put on display for the world to see. But it seems as if the world simply can't stay safe. There's been yet another accident at Scumlabs International, and three more monsters have been created. Your choices at the beginning of the game are Curtis (a speedy mouse), Boris (the slow but strong rhino), and Ruby (a lobster with above-average skills all around). Your first mission in the game is to travel around the world, destroying cities and searching for George, Ralph, and Lizzy. After approximately 75 levels, you'll have all three of the original characters unlocked, which will start your second mission - stopping an alien invasion. <P>While there's plenty of levels in the game, they're all pretty interchangeable. Sometimes the buildings are a different color, or the layout of the building is different, but you still just pound all the buildings into dust, eat a few humans to keep your life up, and proceed. The larger cities (San Francisco or St. Louis, for example) have landmarks in the background that help a little bit to distinguish them from other cities, but since the landmarks are in the background, you can't interact with them at all. <P>The sound effects and music in Rampage 2 are pretty average. The entire soundscape is pretty muffled, and the music is an annoying and repetitive mix of bad guitar rock. Also, the screams of humans as they fall out of windows are enough to drive you insane after an hour or so. Graphically, the game is pale and dull, and looks about on par with what we've come to expect from sprite-based games on the N64. In comparison, the PlayStation version looks cleaner and contains more frames of animation. <P>Rampage World Tour didn't exactly set the world on fire, and Rampage 2: Universal Tour doesn't bring along enough lighter fluid to warrant picking it up. However, it is an easy game just to sit down in front of and play. If you feel left out because you passed on getting World Tour last year, or you've got young children in the house, or you're looking for a game to play mindlessly for hours at a time, this game is worth a quick rental. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""The Mortal Kombat series has always been fairly story-oriented. The series' storyline was augmented through the MK movie, and to a lesser extent, the MK cartoon. Mortal Kombat Mythologies sets out to further enrich the series' plot by narrowing the focus down to one character. The first (hopefully of many) MKM game focuses on Sub-Zero, and it details his past with Scorpion and how he eventually came to be involved in the Mortal Kombat tournament. The story also sheds quite a bit of light on Midway's newest addition to the fighting series, MK4, specifically the new characters Quan Chi and Shinnok. <P>Basically, MKM plays like an MK game except that instead of fighting in the confines of an arena, you are free to run around and hop on platforms. The controls are identical to MK3, except that a button for picking up items and turning around has been added. Sub-Zero's MK3 combos remain intact. His special moves are also in there, but they must be earned through experience points. In the first level, you'll likely learn the ice blast and slide moves. Later on, Sub will gain the ice clone, a diagonal ice blast that freezes jumping enemies, a running ice move that freezes enemies on contact, and more. But you can't simply freeze people over and over again - each special move takes up a little bit of your ice meter, which recharges at a fairly slow rate. Some of the later special moves take up nearly all your meter, so use them wisely. <P>The graphics in MKM look really nice. The characters maintain a very MK3-like appearance, but the backgrounds give the game a good feel. Also, this game is a prime example of what good FMV sequences should be. They give insight into the story and - surprisingly enough - are well done from an acting and production standpoint, especially Rich Divizio's stunning portrayal of Quan Chi. The game's soundtrack is also a big plus. The music in the Mortal Kombat series has always been terrific, and this game is no exception. <P>I only have a few complaints about MKM. First, in a few spots (Shinnok's Bridge is a perfect example), you can't see the next platform. Instead, you're expected to make a blind-faith jump into the unknown to find a platform that is below the screen's line of sight. Second, the game is a bit too short, relying instead on a set number of lives, while continuing to provide the game's high level of difficulty. Beyond those two problems, MKM is a pretty amazing meld of fighting and platform jumping and is sure to please fans of MK and platform games alike. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Amber: Journeys Beyond (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<i>Amber: Journeys Beyond</i>--a tight and self-contained ghost story--begins when you visit a fellow scientist named Roxy. An avid paranormal researcher, Roxy has chosen her new home because she believes it is haunted. Using a host of unreliable detection devices, she plans to use this house as a laboratory. Her goal: proving the existence of psychic phenomena.<P> Driving out to the house in a thunderstorm, you are run off the road by a shimmering apparition and are sent crashing into a lake. In short order, you discover other things have gone wrong--Roxy is in the garage, apparently dead. It's up to you to save yourself and the overzealous scientist from the forces lurking in the house.<P> Patience and close attention to detail are musts for playing <i>Amber: Journeys Beyond</i>. Critical items are sometimes hard to spot, and one or two of the scenes take place in very dark locales. When you can see, the graphics are crisp and drawn with a faint gothic sensibility, surrounding the player in a milieu of creepy sounds and ghost-catching gadgets.<P> The game is especially suited to beginning or younger gamers, as the problem-solving challenges are on the simple side. Even so, <i>Amber: Journeys Beyond</i> is spooky and engaging, a worthy electronic heir to campfire stories everywhere. <i>Alyx Dellamonica</i>"", ""Several pleasantly creepy experiences await the adventurous in Amber: Journeys Beyond. If you're fascinated by poltergeists and unexplained phenomena, or simply enjoy sitting alone in the dark and listening for things that go bump in the night, playing this spooky game from Hugh Forest Entertainment might have you sleeping with the lights on - at least for a little while. <P> Set in a house in the North Carolina mountains, Amber is a modern-day ghost hunt where merely observing poltergeist activity has expanded to include interacting with it. Amber gives players an intriguing paranormal experience. What begins as a response to a friend's concern develops into a journey to rescue souls. <P> As you explore the house and the surrounding property seeking clues to your friend's plight, you realize quickly that you are not alone. Strange things are happening and as you figure out how to use your basic equipment, things get stranger. Without giving too much away, I can say that you will learn the history of the souls haunting the house from an up-close-and-personal point of view. Each died a tragic death and is trapped in a purgatory-like state. To help them move into the afterlife, you must solve a series of well-integrated and moderately challenging puzzles. The souls in and of themselves are plenty intriguing - watching the gardener's lifeless body swinging slowly from the rafters, all because he couldn't get a date, makes your life seem a whole lot better. <P> While it may look like a Myst-ical experience, Amber's graphics and sound effects transcend the typical point-and-click static screens encountered in so many adventure games. The richly textured environment is sprinkled with eerie video segments of supernatural activities, like objects flying around in the house and talking bees. It all combines into an engrossing, captivatingly wicked time. <P> Sadly, the game is not without disappointments. It's simply not long enough. With a few more spiritual encounters and puzzles, Amber could have been a great game, not just a good one. Worse still, the final sequence is pathetically anticlimactic compared to the rest of the game. Even so, if you're looking for a few hours of torturous fun, Amber is definitely worth considering. If anything, it'll keep you wondering what really does go bump in the night. <i>--Rebecca B. Anderson</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Omega Boost,,['Disc plus hard plastic protective replacement case only.

This futuristic game pits you against a sinister computer virus named Alphacore. To conquer Alphacore, you must pilot an armed free-floating robot named Omega Boost through 19 diverse zones and, ultimately, travel back in time to stop Alphacore from changing history. Basically, the gameplay of <I>Omega Boost</I> is incredibly straightforward. Simply blow up each enemy that stands in your way. Enemies come in all shapes, sizes, and strengths. We were impressed with the amount of detail put into each enemy--in fact, we often paused the game so that we could better examine each enemy being blown to smithereens. Each zone has a collection of small enemies, a sub- boss, and a boss to conquer.', 'As you progress in the game, you can customize and upgrade your equipment. In champion mode, you will have to finish a level with a good enough destroy rate before you will be allowed to advance. This game also includes a replay mode, which will allow you to leisurely view highlights of your most intense battles.', ""While this game may be pretty to look at, the controls can be difficult to master. You'll definitely need to check out the training zones in order to properly learn how to navigate your hunk of junk metal. We became dizzy from the rotating 3-D and 360-degree environments, which can make your control seem more complicated during a busy barrage of enemy fire from all directions. <i>--Carrie Bell</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Interesting plot</li> <li>Detailed spaceships and explosions</li> <li>Full 3-D, 360-degree rotating action</li> </ul>', '<b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Shooting action can get repetitious</li> <li>May cause dizziness</li> </ul>', 'Thanks largely to 3D shooters such as Sega\'s Panzer Dragoon series, the shooter is officially back in style, after a long drought following the 16-bit era\'s market saturation. While initially more visceral than any similar game on the market, Omega Boost ultimately falls short in playability, style, and longevity. <P>As Japanese logic would dictate, you suit up in a large humanoid robot and fly through several missions to defeat an evil galactic empire bent on destroying humanity. As shooter logic dictates, you are humanity\'s only hope for survival. Omega Boost takes the formula established by Panzer Dragoon and, in the words of chef Emeril Legasse, kicks it up a notch. While your general movement is confined to the ""rails"" in each level, you have more freedom of movement than in any other game in this vein. The Omega Boost robot has two modes of movement: straight and scanning. Straight movement is like that of any other 3D shooter, always moving forward. Scanning movement lets you maneuver around an object in full 3D. Tapping the mode change button will turn you to face any imminent danger that may be approaching, an extremely useful tool for tackling enemies that will ultimately be attacking from above, below, and everywhere in between. Holding the mode change button will let you move along the outside of an invisible sphere, so you move around the huge bosses and deal damage from all sides with ease. In addition to the multiple modes of flight, you have a vulcan rifle with homing shots, lock-on homing lasers, a speed boost, and a few levels into the game, the viper boost, an uncontrollable series of ramming attacks. As in Panzer Dragoon Zwei, your mech is gradually upgraded depending on how well you do in each of the game\'s nine missions, earning you the viper boost and the ability to lock onto more enemies. In addition to the campaign mode, you can play in a number of customizable challenge levels, essentially ultradifficult versions of the original levels. Bam! <P>Unfortunately, Omega Boost is ultimately a vapid game - a quick adrenaline rush almost completely lacking depth. Each level consists of only a few waves of enemies and two or three quickly defeated bosses. Tackling the waves of enemies is never difficult; a quick tap of the mode change button locks onto them, while a tap of the attack button releases the homing lasers that will kill them. With a few exceptions, boss battles are equally predictable - lock on and fire, dash out of the way of enemy fire, turn to face the boss, repeat until dead. For any kind of challenge, you will have to wait until the final series of bosses. Omega Boost is a dismally short game; with the exception of the final level, each of the game\'s levels requires between two and five minutes to complete, resulting in a game that could very well offer nothing new after a few hours of ownership. <P>Omega Boost\'s aesthetics are hard to pin down - while technically brilliant, the game simply lacks the assets to really shine visually. Endowed with possibly the most amazing 3D engine to grace a shooter, the game fills the screen with beautiful effects and transparencies. In all but a few of the challenge levels, the engine still manages to keep a constant 60fps frame rate. Much of this gift is wasted, however, as the game is generally lacking in art assets. While the enemies and bosses are nicely constructed and textured, many levels use the void of space or a single texture as their only backdrop, resulting in a game that\'s lacking visually. Both human actors and CG are used in the expensive-looking FMV sequences that introduce the game and carry the ""story"" on, but the sequences are generally not too exciting or too short to really be appreciated. Omega Boost\'s sound is crisp and clear. Rock and techno tunes provide appropriate backdrop to the spastic action, although some of them have humorously corny lyrics for a space shooter.  <P>With more levels and design variety, Omega Boost could\'ve outclassed every other 3D shooter on the market. With so little of either, however, Omega Boost is only a decent game at best. --Peter Bartholow <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The world is depending on your skills as a space marine to save all of mankind. Are you up to the task? Quake II is the sequel to the smash hit Quake. The sequel features a brand new adventure that will have you swimming through the dark, murky cesspools of the alien world, entering and conquering various military-like bases and eliminating any resistance. You'll need a powerful arsenal of weapons, and luckily, you're supplied generously. Railguns, hyperblasters, grenade launchers and even a BFG (we all know what that means, don't we?) are all waiting to be found as are various items and armors to help you along the way. And of course, there is a multiplayer feature which adds so much life to this game, that people will be playing it for years to come."", 'Whatever else may be said about Quake II, one thing is certain: It is the only first-person shooter to render the original Quake entirely obsolete. Within moments of starting the game, it is safe to say that all but the most irrationally loyal players will acknowledge that Quake II is better than the original in every respect, and that no one who can afford to upgrade will have any reason to ever load Quake again. Considering the countless hours invested by countless players in the game, that\'s a remarkable achievement. <P> It\'s also significant because since Quake shipped 18 months ago, we have seen a steady stream of challengers, games that have been trumpeted by press and players alike as the successors to the first-person throne. But none of these games has actually come through on that count - not Hexen II, not Jedi Knight, and certainly not any of the half-dozen ""Quake Killers"" that have yet to make it out of alphaland and onto store shelves. But Quake II does come through, delivering at least incremental and occasionally monumental improvements over its predecessor. <P> Many gamers describe playing Quake II in semireligious terms, and when immersed in the 3Dfx version of the game, it\'s easy to understand why. The visual effects are awesome, as in awe-inspiring. The masterful weaving of subtle graphic effects - colored hues that blend seamlessly into one another, intricate textures cast over complex and beautiful architectural features, and realistic transitions between light and shadow - creates a graphic environment that is without peer on the PC. Of course, Quake II supports many graphics modes and 3D cards (it utilizes OpenGL), and players will surely find a combination that works well on their system (even if it\'s a now-ancient Pentium 150). But none approaches the 3Dfx version, and it is the only way through which one can fully appreciate the technological achievement of the game. <P> There are gameplay achievements, as well. Most notable, of course, is the inclusion of a well-crafted, mission-driven single-player game. As players of its previous titles know, id has never been much for storylines, and while Quake II won\'t win any interactive fiction awards, it does make a credible effort to pull you into the game emotionally as well as viscerally. As you advance through Quake II\'s multisection levels, an increasingly ominous sense of purpose takes hold. And by the time the prison doors are opened and the factory is breached, it is difficult not to experience a certain tinge of horror, and perhaps even fear - both of which spur you on in a way altogether different from the deathmatch adrenaline rush that made the original Quake so famous. <P> Not to worry - the deathmatch rush is still there. And although the territory is now quite familiar to most players, Quake II offers a compelling multiplayer experience, due in large measure to a much-needed recasting of available weapons. No more does the player with the rocket launcher hold all the cards in deathmatch levels. Devastating alternatives now exist, especially in the form of a new electromagnetic rail gun and more versatile grenades, which may be picked up and thrown in addition to being used with a launcher. Realistic machine and chain guns also pack a powerful punch, with the latter capable of cutting an opponent to shreds within a second or two. The weapons have also been more acutely balanced, making more powerful weapons more difficult to use. For instance, the deadly rail gun takes nearly full second to power up and fire, and requires precise aim. The damage done by rockets has been lessened, and the rocket launcher takes a few moments to reload between shots. <P> The deathmatch experience also benefits from always interesting and occasionally ingenious level design. Not only are the levels tremendously varied in terms of architectural composition, style, and setting, they include boundless opportunities for ambush, sniping, and close-quarter encounters. The omission of a cooperative multiplayer mode is notable and puzzling (especially in light of the enhanced in-game communication capabilities). This issue will surely be addressed in the very near future, if not by id itself, then by any number of aspiring Quake II mod designers. <P> Other aspects of the game are more subtlety improved and fall short of being state-of-the-art. The sound effects, especially when set to the high-quality mode, are superb - so good, in fact, so as to render the rather monotonous musical soundtrack irrelevant (if not downright annoying) by comparison. But the sound effects of the original Quake were also first-class, and one might have hoped for the employment of more advanced technology, such as surround or even positional sound in the sequel. Enemy animations are much better (taking a clear cue from the N64 shooter Turok: Dinosaur Hunter), but in general the base character designs are somewhat nondescript and certainly not a match for those of rivals such as Hexen II. And while the enemy AI often delivers what id promised, and creates opponents that are more tenacious and more cunning than before, there is still something very mechanistic about their movements, almost like if one could look closely enough, the strings connecting them to some cosmic puppeteer might be seen glinting in the light. <P> But none of these are substantial criticisms. Given all of the strengths outlined above, one must conclude that Quake II is nothing less than a remarkable game, and we recommend it without hesitation. Compared with the original, everything in Quake II is better, nothing is worse. But still... there is a lingering sense - especially after spending dozens of hours with the game - that something is missing, that somehow things aren\'t quite right. What\'s missing, in fact what is altogether absent - the sense of true surprise, novelty, and even fun that once existed in the first-person shooter. Or to put it another way: Although it\'s never been done better, it\'s all been done before, and that casts a shadow on the experience that no amount of technology can hope to penetrate.<i>--Vince Broady</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

There's something for everyone, with many nationalities, genders, and fighting styles represented. Since each fighter has different speed, reach, and moves, there is a pleasant amount of depth to the game."", ""<i>Ready 2 Rumble</i> offers two different game modes: Arcade and Championship. Arcade mode is for one or two players, and is simply a series of boxing matches. The single-player option pits you against a computer-controlled opponent, while the two-player format lets you and a buddy hammer it out. Championship mode puts you in charge of your own boxing gym. You start the game with three rookie fighters, facing off in second-rate gyms, and it's your job to train them in hopes of reaching the championship bout."", ""Championship mode also lets you access <i>Ready 2 Rumble</i>'s most innovative feature: the ability to pit your prized fighters against boxers from a friend's gym through the Visual Memory Unit. Just save your stable of boxers onto the VMU and then use it in a buddy's Dreamcast, where you can fight an exhibition match against one of his or her boxers, or arrange a trade. The VMU also lets you save your progress. Without it, all your boxers (and all the secret characters you've managed to unlock) are erased when you turn off the console.

Ultima Collection - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>Ultima Collection</i> is a history of the role-playing genre, all on one CD. Included are 10 games from the Ultima series and commentary by game creator Richard Garriott on the genre and the history of the Ultima series.', ""At last, by popular demand, Origin's venerable role-playing series is available all on one CD-ROM. Most of it, anyway. The Ultima Collection is a praiseworthy historical document, an excellent value, and paradoxically, an unfortunate disappointment. For while this collection presents ten of the most important role-playing games ever designed on a single disc, its self-conscious omissions render the Ultima Collection hopelessly incomplete. <P> The Ultima Collection contains every game in the Ultima series as well as creator Richard Garriott's first published release, Akalabeth. Many of these remain timeless and incredible role-playing games, while some haven't aged as well. Don't expect much from Akalabeth - it's practically 20 years old. Ultima II and III also feel pretty ancient. With somber-looking CGA graphics chock-full of drab black, gray, cyan, and magenta, these two games are much more cumbersome to play than their descendants. The Ultima Collection includes the late '80s full-color remake of Ultima I (as opposed to the original release) whose visual improvements help make it a rather pleasant dungeon hack even today, though it lacks the depth and detail embodied in the later games in the series. <P> Ultima IV is the most tightly woven game in the series. With clearly defined goals, an epic plot, and a powerful game engine, Ultima IV is a classic. Even so, Ultima V is its hands-down superior, with a more streamlined engine, superb graphics that retain their charm to this day, and an awesome story worthy of the Ultima tradition. Ultima VI marks perhaps the greatest graphical leap the Ultima series has ever accomplished, with the introduction of 256-color MCGA graphics. The scale of the world is many times greater than even the vast Ultima V, and the story, centered around the seemingly malicious race of Gargoyles, is thought-provoking and exciting. <P> Ultima VII consists of two stand-alone parts. The original Ultima VII is the most gorgeous game of the series, with its vivid and full-scale world that truly feels alive with secrets and detail. Its plot, dealing with an enigmatic new religious society and the evil being called the Guardian, is unforgettable. A real-time combat engine and fully mouse-driven interface made Ultima VII feel somewhat simpler than its ancestors, but in retrospect the game remains a marvelous achievement. Serpent Isle, the continuation of Ultima VII, is often considered the best Ultima ever made. Though its look is mostly borrowed from Ultima VII, Serpent Isle offers a huge quest and some of the most fascinating characters and situations ever to be found in a role-playing game. <P> In light of Ultima VII and Serpent Isle, it's little wonder why most everyone hated Ultima VIII when it was published not so long ago in 1994. The frightfully simplistic game mechanics combined with action-oriented puzzles and a loathsome combat engine frustrated most long-time fans of the series. Nonetheless, the game is not without merit; a complex spell-casting system and an uncompromising, morally ambiguous plot make Ultima VIII a worthy quest for those willing to get acquainted with its elusive gameplay. But sadly, even the once-impressive 3D-rendered graphics look practically amateurish by current standards, making Ultima VIII an infinitely cumbersome game. <P> The Ultima Collection is missing the two spin-off series: the outstanding 3D first-person Ultima Underworlds and the artful Worlds of Ultima games. Ultima Underworld is sold separately in stores either on the discount bin or as part of Interplay's Ultimate RPG Archives. But the Worlds of Ultima games are casualties of the times, nowhere to be found and utterly forgotten by all but the most die-hard fans. Based on the Ultima VI game engine, the Worlds of Ultima games cast the Avatar in wondrous, new lands. Savage Empire, the first Worlds of Ultima game, pits the Avatar in a prehistoric setting filled with dinosaurs and Stone Age tribesmen. Among other things, the Avatar constructs rifles and gunpowder from natural items, sets a trap to kill an enormous Tyrannosaurus Rex, and befriends an ancient reptilian race. Savage Empire, let alone any reference to its existence, is not included in the Ultima Collection. The second Worlds of Ultima game, Martian Dreams, is in several ways the most ambitious Ultima ever created. The Avatar is trapped on the planet Mars along with Earth's most important modern historical figures from Vladimir Lenin to Andrew Carnegie, and with their help he must find a way home. In doing so, he steps into his own dreams to uncover the fate of a Martian race on the brink of extinction. Martian Dreams is also entirely absent from the Ultima Collection. <P> Omissions notwithstanding, the Ultima Collection does a good job presenting the ten games it does contain. Akalabeth and the first six Ultimas are readily playable under Windows 95 (even in a window) and run fine even on fast machines with the help of the included speed reduction utility. Getting Ultima VII and VIII to work is more challenging because of their unorthodox DOS-based memory management, and unless you have DOS drivers installed on your computer you won't be able to play them at all. Also contained in the package is a complete atlas featuring reprints of the maps included in the Ultima games over the years. At the same time, each game's original manual may be found on the CD-ROM in Adobe Acrobat format, while copy protection and all important general information are also accessible in the Collection's printed documentation. And to sweeten the deal all the more, the Ultima Collection includes video interviews with the series' creator in which he discusses the origins of the series and where he wants it to go. <P> While the Ultima Collection does not necessarily promise to give you every Ultima ever made, its failure to include the Underworld and Worlds of Ultima games makes it feel painfully incomplete for the fan hoping to get his hands on a complete archive of Garriott's work. But it does contain several of the best role-playing games of all time. It's a package worth owning for any number of reasons, not the least of which is that half of these games are still perfectly worth playing for the first time, or playing all over again.<i>--Greg Kasavin</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Pharaoh - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Pharaoh is a strategic city-building game set in Egypt, from roughly 2900 to 700 BC. Grow Egyptian villages into thriving metropolises and watch the economy and inhabitants of this exotic land come to life. Interact with the citizens. Observe their culture and habits. Raise their hopes or raze their homes. Manage your city poorly and watch it burn, be pillaged, or collapse in economic ruin. Manage it well, and ultimately, the greatest Egyptian structures will be built in your honor. Your rule will span generations until your dynasty, your royal bloodline, produces a Pharaoh! Pharaoh includes many features never before seen in a city-building series game, including a farming model based on the flooding of the Nile, naval warfare, giant monuments assembled over time, a unique dynastic progression, and variable difficulty levels. It uses 16-bit color graphics, large maps for seamless game play, and a proven interface.', 'Pharaoh takes Impressions\' popular Caesar III, relocates it to ancient Egypt, and adds a few welcome features. Like Caesar III, Pharaoh\'s gameplay falls somewhere between the intensive city-management of Maxis\' SimCity series and the combination of city management and combat found in Blue Byte\'s Settlers games. However, Pharaoh is neither a sequel nor an expansion to Caesar III; although many of the game mechanics are identical to its predecessor, the strategy is noticeably different in order to suit Pharaoh to its setting. Pharaoh is an all-around better game than Caesar III, and while it may seem overly familiar to fans of that game, it offers enough variety and innovation to keep things interesting. <P>The game begins simply, requiring you to create jobs and homes to attract settlers. Once your population begins growing, you must make sure it has food and water, access to religious facilities, entertainment, and other luxuries to attract a larger and more affluent populace. You must also ensure that your people are protected by a suitably strong militia. <P>Accomplishing these goals is a complex process. Most goods require natural resources in order to be produced, and many of these resources must be imported. Many of the goods must be imported as well, and you must manage the distribution of these items to make sure everyone is getting enough of what they need to survive and what they want to live happily. Imports can be pricey, so you must also produce items for export. <P>Unlike in SimCity, management of your city in Pharaoh is a very hands-on experience. With the sole exception of housing, which will upgrade itself based on nearby services, you decide exactly what type of building will be placed where. Storehouses and industrial buildings must be close enough to residences that goods will be easily accessible, but not so close that they lower property value. The same principle applies to markets, which distribute food and luxury items to your people. Those who found themselves frustrated by the inability to manage market workers\' distribution routes in Caesar III will be glad to know that a roadblock option has been included in Pharaoh, giving you some control over where patrolling workers will walk. It\'s not a perfect solution - strict management over their routes would still be welcome - but it certainly helps. <P>The ancient Egyptian setting of the game leads to some other interesting new features. The regular flooding of the Nile River demands you produce or import enough food to last through the flood season. A poor inundation can lead to bad irrigation and food shortages, so satisfying the god of the flood, Osiris, becomes a top priority. The religion system in Pharaoh has also been improved since Caesar III. Satisfying the gods is now a higher priority, but there are fewer gods to deal with in each scenario, thereby making the process slightly less involved. <P>The primary play mode of Pharaoh is the ""family"" mode. You control a ruling family who must govern a series of cities, each time taking on more responsibility and earning more respect. The mission-based nature of this mode is interesting; instead of being a simple open-ended management simulation like SimCity, in Pharaoh you have very specific goals, but these can take a long time to achieve. New options and features are introduced at a rate that keeps things interesting, and the end result is a game with a great deal of longevity. Those who prefer a more open-ended simulation will want to play the game\'s ""sandbox"" mode, which lets you build and govern without the constraints of the scenario objectives. <P>Pharaoh\'s missions are also more involving than those in Caesar III. Combat is still a secondary element, but it is easy to control and never really becomes the focus. In most missions, you\'re required to build monuments, and these get larger and more costly as you progress. Not only does this provide a bit of tangible success to each scenario - seeing a huge pyramid completed is far more satisfying than reaching some arbitrary numerical rating - but the monuments also add some visual excitement to a game that otherwise looks like Caesar III with an Egyptian flavor. That\'s not to say it looks bad; the landscape graphics may be somewhat bland, but the building graphics and animations are detailed and appealing. <P>Pharaoh is only subtly different from its predecessor, but its new elements make it much deeper and more satisfying. Like Caesar III, Pharaoh takes ideas from other games and combines them in a way that is different and entertaining. Unlike Caesar III, the frustrations that accompany some of the game\'s mechanics are easily dealt with. Pharaoh is slow-paced but addictive and is immensely complex but incredibly easy to play. --<i>Ron Dulin</i><BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Metal Fatigue - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Developed by Zono, Inc., <i>Metal Fatigue</i> is a real-time strategy game that follows the story of three brothers caught up on opposite sides of a war over the riches of a long-dead alien civilization. Explores classic Japanese anime themes of loyalty and betrayal, bravery and cowardice, and the hierarchical pressure to choose between serving the needs of the individual, family, or state--while giant combat robots battle over the outcome.', 'Many real-time strategy games center on massive battles between different types of tanks. Metal Fatigue takes this convention to the next level by focusing on ""combots,"" giant robots reminiscent of those in various Japanese animated cartoon series. Metal Fatigue\'s concept is innovative both in its modular unit design and in its multilevel battlefields that take place in orbit, on the surface, and underground all at once; but the game\'s unbalanced units, as well as a few interface problems, cut it short of its potential. <P> The game\'s story is similar to what you might expect from giant robot anime such as Macross and Gundam. In Metal Fatigue, three corporate factions, which coexist in an uneasy alliance, have discovered alien technology in the far-off Hedoth system. In an initial skirmish over the discovery, three brothers - Diego, Stephan, and the treacherous Jonas - find their loyalties split among separate factions, and soon, open war breaks out. A ten-mission campaign is devoted to telling the story of each of the three ""CorpoNations"": the balanced RimTech, the aggressive MilAgro, and the high-tech, stealthy Neuropa.', ""Each CorpoNation has its own combot technologies, but during the course of a mission, it's possible to retrieve parts abandoned on the battlefield and research them for your own faction's use. What makes this possible is the modular construction of the combots themselves, as each is constructed from four components - torso, legs, and right and left arms. While the modular design somewhat reduces the visual distinctiveness of each side, it does make it fairly easy to eyeball the composition of your opponents. In fact, much of the game's strategic interest lies in adjusting your combot production to best oppose the combot designs you're facing. The array of available melee and ranged weapons can deal out either energy or kinetic damage, and the various defenses can defend against either type. In addition, torso and leg designs can provide extra armor or special abilities such as cloaking, increased hand-to-hand damage, and jump jets."", ""In stark contrast with the complex modularity of combot production, there are only four conventional offensive units: a tank, a mobile surface-to-air missile launcher, a modest artillery piece, and a special combot-debilitating spell unit. The conventional units are rather simple and are functionally equivalent for the three sides. The primary use for conventional ground units is to go into the subterranean tunnels that are much too small and unstable for the giant combots. Yet, as support units for your main combot cavalry, they are often little more than expensive targets. A speedy melee-equipped combot can quickly turn a tank battalion into a gutted mass of metal. The primary base defenses also seem underpowered, considering their cost and build time, though the walls and gun emplacement have the atypical, yet convenient advantage of being mobile. Metal Fatigue doesn't aspire in any apparent way toward a rock-paper-scissors unit balance, and, in practice, it rewards you simply for throwing as many multipurpose combots at a target as possible."", ""Furthermore, the mix of very large and very small units exacerbates the game's pathfinding issues, the chronic weak point for real-time strategy games. The game's 3D structures and units alternately seem capable of packing impossibly tightly together one minute; while in the next minute, they seem to get stuck on thin air. Though you might think that a militaristic bunch like the MilAgro could march lockstep in their sleep, its units refuse to follow movement orders sensibly with disproportionate frequency. The problem is compounded when a squad of large combots tries to walk in a tight-box formation, the only one available. Too often, a valuable combot will get stuck behind just a few tanks and will twist and turn uselessly, trying to find a way out. When a combot is under heavy fire in tight terrain, supporting tanks will without a doubt prove to be a deadly hindrance."", ""The concept of dividing the battlefield into three separate levels - orbital, surface, and underground - no doubt helps balance the game's otherwise combot-heavy combat. However, in practice, having the action spread across multiple levels puts undue stress on the most important resource in a real-time strategy game - a player's time - without easing the issue of multitasking. Orbital play and underground play add two basic infrastructure tasks: Carving out subterranean tunnels to connect resource-bearing lava caverns and building numerous small solar panels in orbit. Solar panels are very useful in large numbers, but they add a frustrating amount of micromanagement since they must be built as individual structures. A little more build automation or a centralized interface could have made this a much less cumbersome element in each mission."", ""The game's single resource is energy, measured in megajoules. Energy harvesting is a rather painless process, since your hover vehicles transparently beam the thermal energy they collect from lava pools right back to your base. A diligent pack of harvesters can cool a lava pool in short order, so it's fortunate that solar panels, deployed on your orbital stations, can provide a slow but steady stream of energy while the lava flow gradually warms back up again. The last infrastructure elements are the drill trucks that can slowly bore tunnels for your underground empire, and the cryofarms where you can warm up cryogenically stored troops to provide manpower for structures and conventional units."", ""The game's 3D graphics show their colors when a squad of combots engages in heated combat. The combots have quite a range of fluid melee animations, as they block, kick, and spin while wielding giant katanas, axes, and hammers to devastating effect. Moreover, edged weapons have a good chance of slicing off an enemy's arms, which can be retrieved for use with your own units. Even though the camera can be zoomed and spun around to get the best view of the action, fortunately the 3D terrain rarely obscures your vision - so it's often sufficient to simply scroll the 3D camera around, just as in a 2D real-time strategy game."", ""Metal Fatigue won't win many points for its artistic design. The game's 3D maps often seem to share a common pool of uninspired textures, and they generally lack the little details that might have made Hedoth a more immersive environment. Though simple colors befit the game's overall anime-like appearance, the map textures greatly overuse metallics, blues, and, in the dreary subterranean layer, browns. Similarly, the in-game music reuses its riffs with abandon. At least there's even a rather simple attempt to match each campaign's music to the personality of the respective CorpoNation. You hear fairly subdued military marches playing as the RimTech, a funky rock mix as the violent MilAgro, and airy New Age as the mysterious Neuropa."", 'Despite its problems, fans of anime or mech games should find that Metal Fatigue is a fun, fast-paced real-time strategy game. The missions that showcase the open-field strengths of the combots are particularly satisfying. If the game shipped last year, as originally scheduled, it might have led the current wave of 3D real-time strategy games. However, as it stands, Metal Fatigue will likely get lost beside a number of better-looking, more balanced games. <br>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

An age swept into the ravaging gale of chaos by the arrival of a single, uninvited race: the Humans. The fragile balance that existed between the ancient races--Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, and other--has changed into a struggle for power and survival in the wake of the turmoil the Humans have brought to the land. Prepare for an adventure where you will uncover wondrous ancient artifacts, awesome magical power, and the secrets of a shattered empire. Ally with the forces of light or darkness to determine the fate of the earth in the Age of Wonders.<P> <I>Age of Wonders</I> is a strategy game in development by Triumph Studios and Epic MegaGames and is being published by The Gathering of Developers. The setting is a rich fantasy world where magic and primitive technology coexist. Age of Wonders lets you utilize hundreds of fantasy units, heroes, items, and spells to overcome your opponents in strategic and tactical fantasy warfare. <I>Age of Wonders</I> also incorporates role playing and adventure elements, with many mysterious places to explore and a diverse array of characters to encounter.<P> Play the game in a captivating nonlinear single-player campaign or with friends. In the single-player game, your decisions influence the outcome of the entire fantasy realm. The game features an exciting magic system, including spell research and more than 100 spells spread over seven spheres of magic. You can even hand tailor your heroes as they grow in experience and power.<P> This software is a native Windows application with DirectX support, and it runs in either a window or full screen. Other features include a point-and-click interface with tool tips and online help; DirectPlay and Play-by-email (PBEM) support for multiple players on a single PC (or over Internet, LAN, modem, or direct connection); a choice of Round Robin or Simultaneous turn schemes for multiplayer games (simultaneous turns greatly speed up multiplayer games!); and a rich, orchestral soundtrack and digitized sound effects.', ""Age of Wonders isn't ostentatious or innovative. Though it does do a handful of new things, its basic gameplay involves exploring a map, claiming as many resources as possible, and generating units at your towns to form armies to wage war with your opponent's similarly created armies. Specifically, its map exploration, resource management, and unit-based armies bear a striking resemblance to other turn-based strategy games that have been released before it. Age of Wonders encompasses many facets of games that have preceded it, but it adds improvements of its own and is consequently a complex and highly evolved strategy game. <P>Age of Wonders' visuals are inconsistent; its menu screens and opening movie are graced by elegant hand-painted art, whose effective use of shadow and simple color contrasts lend it a distinctive and pleasingly understated quality. Unfortunately, this picturesque style isn't carried over to the maps on which most of the game is played. Though the maps themselves have the same colorful and detailed look of New World Computing's Heroes of Might and Magic games, the same can't be said for Age of Wonders' units, whose miniscule size, stilted animation, and sometimes downright silly appearance contrast oddly with the game's otherwise high fantasy look. <P>Age of Wonders' sound is also inconsistent; at any given time, there's always some sort of music playing in the background, and it's usually stirring and thematically appropriate and never obtrusive. However, one of the most important - and frequent - components of Age of Wonders' gameplay is combat. Unfortunately, between the scurrying of poorly animated units across the screen and the alternating sound of the generic loud slapstick thwack when a melee unit hits its target and the accompanying generic yelp of pain, combat sometimes seems more like a Benny Hill skit than anything else. <P>Whatever else may be said about how it looks or sounds, Age of Wonders is a solid, if not entirely original game to play. Its resource management system, which mostly consists of moving your units over mines and other resources on the map to claim them as your own, is essentially identical to that of Heroes of Might and Magic. Of its two combat systems, Age of Wonders' isometric-perspective tactical combat is reminiscent of Master of Magic. Age of Wonders borrows its quick combat system from SSG's Warlords III: Darklords Rising, along with many other features, including the ability to create war parties without a hero in the lead, to create eight-creature army stacks, to raze and loot towns and other structures, and the ability to play turns simultaneously against your opponent. <P>However, Age of Wonders does manage to distinguish itself from its peers with several interesting new features. First and foremost is the sheer number of different factions to play: There are 12 races to choose from, and in turn, 12 corresponding sets of combat units. Though the sets of units may seem similar enough at first (and are therefore equally accessible at first), each distinguishes itself from the rest thanks to various inherent abilities and increasingly divergent upper-level units. <P>Another important way in which Age of Wonders exceeds its fantasy-themed turn-based brethren is by having two combat systems: Any and all conflicts can be resolved either through tactical or quick combat, which helps expedite messy battles or easy walkover fights in an otherwise very time-consuming game. Neither system is at all innovative in and of itself, but the ability to choose between either makes combat so much more convenient, you'll wonder why other similar games haven't done the same. <P>Age of Wonders' interface is also decidedly unoriginal. Though each of the four windows - the overland map, the minimap, the status menu, and the Warlords-style message ticker - can be resized or simply closed, each one must remain open to play effectively. Fortunately, once you acclimate yourself to them, you'll find their functionality goes a long way in compensating for the space they take up. The overland and minimaps are as useful as any found in any similar game, while the message ticker provides quick summaries of important events. The status menu in the lower left-hand corner is particularly useful, since it contains information about all of your holdings, troops, and heroes and lets you jump to any of them with a single right-click. <P>As in some other similar turn-based strategy games, Age of Wonders lets both heroes and units advance in experience levels. However, the path of your hero's advancement is entirely up to you. You can begin with default heroes or customize your hero with one of more than 70 different portraits and further customize him with fully adjustable attributes and the full list of any and all available hero abilities. And when your hero gains an experience level, you're not given a single choice of advancement from a restricted list. Your hero is instead awarded with a certain number of points and can choose from the same list of all the special abilities available. Naturally, some abilities cost more points than others and will require your hero to advance an additional level before purchasing them. In any case, you have a great deal of control over both the creation and development of your heroes, especially as they gain levels; this is particularly important in Age of Wonders' campaign, in which you carry your main leader hero from scenario to scenario. <P>The Age of Wonders campaign itself can be played in one of two ways, either as the good-aligned races allied with the elves or as the evil-aligned races allied with the dark elves. In either case, the campaign game consists of scenarios that branch off in a nonlinear fashion dictated by the game's story: You'll be forced to choose from different paths based on the path you previously chose, and the end result will in fact affect your standing in the final scenario. This branching structure adds to Age of Wonders' replay value, as you can always reload a previous saved game and try exploring a different path. <P>The game includes 22 scenarios, two branching campaigns, and a map editor, which collectively provide many hours of solid gameplay. Unfortunately, Age of Wonders doesn't have a random-map generator, so jumping into a new quick-and-dirty scenario isn't an option. As such, after you've tried all the scenarios and the campaigns and familiarized yourself with all the maps, you won't have much new material to look forward to outside of player-made maps. <P>Age of Wonders looks and sounds good for the most part. It doesn't break much new ground, but it does integrate some of the best elements of some of the best turn-based strategy games out there with a few of its own features. -- <i>Andrew Seyoon Park</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

As such, it\'s appropriate that Gearbox Software\'s Opposing Force, the official expansion for the genre-redefining Half-Life, in turn sets a new standard of quality for future action-game mission packs. <P>Opposing Force\'s story recounts the events of Half-Life, but from the opposing side\'s perspective as implied by the title. You are Marine Corporal Adrian Shephard. You\'ve been sent to the Black Mesa Research Facility to locate and eliminate Gordon Freeman. As in the original, things immediately go awry, mistakes are made, people die, and your initial plan is replaced with a complicated fight for survival. It\'s a testament to the success of Half-Life that its story actually warrants retelling. The developers know that while Adrian Shephard has no idea what Freeman is doing, you do, and they pack the game with clues as to where you are in relation to Half-Life\'s hero. Your path initially converges with Freeman\'s, then takes some unexpected detours. Many of the original settings and incidents are referred to or revisited from a slightly altered perspective, and it\'s a ringing endorsement of their effectiveness that to give any of them away would lessen your enjoyment of the game. <P>Like Half-Life, Opposing Force\'s greatest strength is its success at consistently delivering surprises. You can sense the designers\' enthusiasm as one memorable scene unfolds after another, and it compels you to keep playing. Although Opposing Force is only about one third as long as its predecessor, it\'s packed with original content. There isn\'t much filler in the game, so while you may finish it in just over ten hours or so, the experience feels much more complete and satisfying than many longer games, which tend to be padded with hours of drearily similar firefights. <P>Despite its relatively short length, there\'s plenty of shooting in Opposing Force. Instead of limiting you to fighting alongside no more than two of Half-Life\'s weakling scientists or security guards, you can now recruit a squad of up to eight marines. The marines have the same advanced artificial intelligence as when they were your enemies in Half-Life, so that some of the large-scale battles staged in Opposing Force are simply phenomenal. Even though the game doesn\'t require you to do so, you\'ll want to replay such combat sequences just to try out different strategies in an effort to reduce friendly casualties. <P>However, although the game lets you lead so many companions, you\'ll likely never have more than four at a time thanks to the AI\'s finicky following behavior. Opposing Force\'s only significant flaw is that it\'s often difficult to keep your followers in line. In some instances they simply appear to become confused, and at other times there is an invisible line they will not cross. It\'s usually unclear which of these two reasons keeps your squad from moving forward, so you\'ll spend too much time trying in vain to keep it assembled. This is a shame, as the rest of the game is of such high quality. <P>Opposing Force adds nine new weapons to Half-Life\'s arsenal. There are a few additions to each original category - standard guns, experimental guns, and alien artifacts - and each is useful for the most part. An especially clever version of a grappling hook is put to good use in many of Opposing Force\'s action sequences and puzzles. The new experimental weapon\'s secondary firing mode transports you to a small section of the alien world Xen, where you can gather some extra health and ammo in the heat of battle. <P>Most of the aliens in Half-Life weren\'t nearly as crafty as the enemy soldiers. Opposing Force introduces a new breed of alien warrior that is the marine\'s tactical equal, along with about ten other new allies and adversaries, including a few impressive boss monsters. Some of the new 3D models are merely window dressing but add to the game\'s rich atmosphere. A great number of scripted sequences have also been created for Opposing Force, which are often darkly humorous - the designers at Gearbox seem to harbor a real grudge against Half-Life\'s hapless scientists and dispatch them with sadistic ingenuity. <P>Opposing Force doesn\'t include any new multiplayer game modes but is packaged with a set of multiplayer maps designed by a team of ""all-stars"" assembled by Gearbox, including such level design luminaries as Tom ""Paradox"" Mustaine and the Levelord. As you\'d expect, these map designs are all at least competent. Most of the new weapons and character models are also available in the multiplayer game. However, the excellent single-player experience remains the best reason to get Opposing Force. <P>While it doesn\'t add anything new to the graphics or technology of Half-Life, Opposing Force still manages to thrill through the impassioned application of creative design. It\'s the interactive equivalent of a page-turner; you\'ll finish it in a marathon sitting just trying to see what surprise lies around the next corner. Quite simply, the best first-person shooter ever released is now bolstered by the finest mission pack yet created. -- <i>Erik Wolpaw</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Rocket: Robot on Wheels,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"[""Whoopie World, the ultimate amusement park, is set to open tomorrow and, wouldn't you know it, the distraught second-in-command, Jojo the Raccoon, has gone nuts, smashing rides and scattering admission tickets everywhere. Enter park maintenance robot Rocket, hastily assigned to repair the rides and collect the tickets."", 'This 3-D platform adventure game is easily one of the most atypical Nintendo 64 titles to come along in quite a while--as evidenced by the premise--and could very well join the ranks of <I>Banjo-Kazooie</I> and <I>Mario 64</I> for its beautiful cartoon style and massive game world.', 'As Rocket--half unicycle, half armless, uh, contraption--players navigate through the seven game worlds using the robot\'s powerful tractor beam in place of arms to grab and lift items, battle enemies, solve a grand variety of puzzles, and hang and swing from handles. The signature Fun-Physics game engine incorporates real-world character and environmental physics--Rocket realistically sways as he wheels along, and one can virtually ""feel"" the weight of objects lifted with the tractor beam. It\'s a whole new--and wacky--world for gamers, and a very welcomed one at that. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>', ""Rocket: Robot on Wheels is a delightful platform game that on the surface resembles other pointless, cute, character-driven platform games. However, after spending some time with Rocket, it reveals itself to be a deep, fun-filled adventure that really draws you in. Rocket begins in a typically cute and fuzzy fashion at a futuristic theme park on the eve of its opening day. The man in charge of the operation leaves our hero, a robotic unicycle, to tend to the park while the man is at home. And yes, something terrible happens. The vindictive mascot of the park, Jojo the Raccoon, escapes from his cage and rewires the whole park. So it's up to you, as Rocket the Robot Unicycle, to make things right again. Once you start to play and get a feel for the control, the game seems straightforward. But Rocket isn&#x92;t your typical fast-paced platformer. Each level contains sublevel upon sublevel, not to mention minigames, puzzles, and lots of little things  to interact with and figure out. For instance, early in the game you find out that one of the roller coasters is missing several screws. Once you chase down the screws within the level and bring them back to the attraction you must build a roller coaster that you'll actually get to ride. Building the track in the proper way will let you grab more items and bonuses. This hands-on problem-solving technique is really what sets the game apart from other platformers. Instead of just hitting button A to smash object B and collect item C, you must use your head along with a fair amount of control pad dexterity. The struggle and triumph of solving the problem is more of a reward than the actual object you are trying to collect. Visually, Rocket looks like a typical N64 platform game. The game has a very basic, colorful look. While Rocket himself looks good, the cast of generic characters you come across in the game are a little on the simple side. The whole production moves along at a smooth pace with a healthy frame rate. Of course, like most 3D platform games on the market, the camera isn't completely glitch-proof. There are occasions when the camera points directly at Rocket's face, leaving you blind as to what awaits you. The aural portion of Rocket is par for the N64 course. Happy, lighthearted tunes permeate the entire game, and the sound effects are cartoony in nature.  In the end, Rocket is a good platform game that will please platform fans. Its gameplay is diverse yet solid, and it all combines to form a game that will keep you interested for quite some time.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Swat 3: Close Quarters Battle - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""It's Los Angeles, 2005. In the next seven days, representatives from every nation around the world will converge on Los Angeles to witness the signing of the United Nations Nuclear Abolishment Treaty. The protection of these dignitaries falls on the shoulders of one organization: LAPD SWAT. As a SWAT element leader, your assignment for the next 24/7 is to lead your team against the global forces that would prevent the city from hosting the treaty ceremony and joining the rest of the world in celebrating Global Peace Day 2005."", ""Proving that there's room for innovation even in a crowded genre, SWAT 3: Close Quarters Battle enters the squad-level combat arena armed to the teeth with unique features and killer gameplay. Though the game suffers from a few design flaws and a complete lack of multiplayer capabilities (at least initially), it still has what it takes to challenge Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear for supremacy."", 'Set in Los Angeles of 2005, the game puts you in command of a SWAT team faced with mounting terrorist activity. It seems that every insurgent group worth its salt has come to LA to stir up trouble during the days preceding the signing of the historical Nuclear Abolishment Treaty. Your job, over the course of 16 missions, is to root out these radical elements, protect the civilians and dignitaries who stumble into their path, and bring your team back in one piece.', ""The gameplay is unique among squad-level games in that you command your troops on the fly and not just from tactical maps. While the Spec Ops games offer this feature, in SWAT 3 it actually works well and is absolutely essential for mission success. As each crisis arises, you are given a thorough rundown of the situation from Metro command. The location, any hostages, and expected opposition are all outlined in the game's excellent briefing screens. You can check to see what each notable enemy and hostage looks like so that you shoot and protect the appropriate people when the time comes. There's even a timetable of terrorist demands for some of the time-critical missions."", 'After your briefing, you select appropriate gear for yourself and your team. The weapon selection is limited but more than sufficient. Each trooper in your unit is equipped with tons of extra equipment, like CS gas canisters, flashbangs, all-in-one ""toolkits"" (which are handy for unlocking doors and disarming explosives), and an Opti-Wand. The Opti-Wand is a tiny mirror on the end of a 48-inch stick and is particularly cool because it lets you see around corners and into rooms before entering. Each trooper also has a hefty supply of handcuffs, which you\'ll need on every single mission.', ""That's because SWAT 3 isn't just about taking the bad guys down. More often than not, you can coax the perpetrators into surrendering, at which point you must cuff them and radio in for your backup forces to come pick them up. In fact, you must do this frequently; since you can't always tell who's an enemy and who's not, you typically have to cuff and cart off everyone you encounter. Of course, this is for your protection as well as theirs, and it adds a unique element to the gameplay."", 'The only problem with the cuff-and-cart requirement is that, as the squad leader, you must personally radio in every single pickup request. Even if you kill or arrest every bad guy on a given level, your mission is still not done until you radio in a pickup request for every single living perp. While having to do this is probably realistic in some sense, it can become overwhelming on the later, far more chaotic levels, especially because you need to radio in all the requests yourself.', ""It's little problems like these that collectively keep SWAT 3 from being the hands-down champion in the squad-level action genre. However, it has bigger problems, like a complete lack of multiplayer support. Sierra claims that a multiplayer add-on is coming very soon, but it's almost unthinkable that the game could have been brought to market without it. The holiday buying season is undoubtedly responsible, which is too bad because SWAT 3 is one game that begs for a multiplayer option."", 'Even so, SWAT 3 has plenty of good points that help compensate for the omission of multiplayer support. For instance, the graphics are spectacular and arguably the best in the genre. Character models are incredibly lifelike and even have eyes that blink and dart left and right. The motion-captured movements are similarly realistic, and the textures are outstanding. Each level in the game is equally well rendered. Environments like the church, bank, and convention center are amazingly detailed - and daunting, because they have tons of doorways, rooms, and objects for terrorists to hide behind. For sheer immersion, SWAT 3 clearly has the competition beaten.', ""The game's interface is also excellent; it has a transparent inventory overlay that lets you select a new SWAT toy without ever taking your eyes off the action. You can easily order your squad members with an unobtrusive menu that sits neatly in the upper corner of the screen. Even better, you direct each order with your reticle. In other words, if you want a team to breach and flashbang a room, you point at the doorway and issue the command. The interface and command system gives you near-total control of your troops, even in the heat of battle."", ""But SWAT 3's most impressive feature has to be the amazing artificial intelligence employed by friend and foe alike. The terrorists in the game are a formidable bunch who react to all manner of situations. Some will come running at the sound of gunfire, while others will go look for help. Others will investigate blood spots on the floor or opened doors - but each acts differently from the rest. The same goes for your squadmates, who act according to their uniquely predefined personality setting. Some will rush headlong into danger, while others will proceed with caution. And regardless of their style or orders, the computer-controlled troopers in SWAT 3 are easily the best and most effective teammates you could ever hope to have on your side. They carry out your orders efficiently and oftentimes better than you could. You'll still see the occasional logjam on stairways in this game, but nothing that halts gameplay for very long and certainly no mission-ending catastrophes caused by bad pathfinding."", ""Unfortunately, the game has a bad tendency to loop audio, mostly on quips coming from cuffed bad guys. It can be incredibly annoying, and it often takes extreme restraint not to put a virtual bullet in these perps' chatty little heads. The audio also falters when you have to make numerous reports in a short span of time. For example, on one level you must rescue a number of hostages in a TV studio. If you radio in too many reports too quickly, you'll hear a stuttering, overlapping barrage of acknowledgements in reply. And unlike in Rogue Spear, you automatically fail your mission if you die - you cannot switch to your next squadmate. Even if that's realistic, it can be frustrating on the larger levels when the very last terrorist gets a bead on you before you can squeeze off a round."", ""However, even with its minor failings, SWAT 3 is impressive. It's a crying shame that it shipped without multiplayer support - and it would be a bigger shame if Sierra adds that support later at an additional cost - but the game that did make it to store shelves is a very good one. -- <i>Michael E.

Freespace 2,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""The drama of the award-winning space-combat simulation of '98 continues in <I>Freespace 2,</I> featuring massive juggernaut warships, jaw-dropping visual effects, and white-knuckle dogfight action. Explore a vast, enigmatic nebula and battle a mysterious adversary to determine the fate of humanity. The year is 2367. Thirty-two years have passed since the Great War. The only jump node to Sol collapsed long ago, isolating Earth from the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance (GTVA), a new government uniting old enemies. As the Terrans and Vasudans struggle to rebuild their civilizations, civil war erupts in the Polaris system. A rogue Terran admiral declares war against the Vasudans, and his rebellion threatens the stability of the Alliance. Without warning, the Shivans return, and the GTVA launches a crusade to eliminate their Great War nemesis. Once again, the Alliance must crush the Shivan onslaught or face annihilation."", 'Since the early 1990s, Totally Games\' X-Wing series and Origin Systems\' Wing Commander series have maintained a stranglehold on the space-sim genre. Until last year, the space sims released by other companies were derivative of those two series yet generally had less impressive graphics, substandard gameplay, and dull plots. But some worthy challengers finally appeared in 1998 when Particle Systems unveiled Independence War and Volition released Descent: Freespace. <P> Of those two contenders, Independence War was more original, as it featured a complex physics-modeling system and put you in charge of a large capital ship. Descent: Freespace was more of a traditional space sim, as it effectively cannibalized the best elements of the genre\'s classics in addition to providing an outstanding interface and several other refreshing innovations. But while Particle Systems\' follow-up game, Independence War Deluxe, was a mild disappointment, Volition\'s FreeSpace 2 is an outstanding sequel that significantly improves upon its enjoyable predecessor. Even if Totally Games had not effectively abandoned its X-Wing franchise earlier this year, and Origin had not decided to focus solely on multiplayer games, there\'s no doubt there\'s a new king in town. FreeSpace 2 is one of the best space sims ever made and is a solid candidate for game of the year. <P> FreeSpace 2 picks up 32 years after the events of the original game. In Descent: Freespace, a 14-year war between Terrans and Vasudans was rudely interrupted by the appearance of an ominous and technologically superior race, dubbed the Shivans. To avoid extinction, the Terrans and Vasudans were forced to set aside their differences and forge a desperate alliance. Even though Descent: Freespace concentrated most of its plot developments into the first third of the game, the story ended effectively, granting the isolated remnants of the Terran and Vasudan civilizations a Pyrrhic victory. The plot of FreeSpace 2 ties deeply into the events of the original game, but new players can quickly learn what they missed through the game\'s comprehensive and interesting database. The Terrans and Vasudans remain allied and have rebuilt their societies, but their harmony is disrupted when a rogue group of Terrans secedes from the alliance because of its apparent distrust of the Vasudans. When the Shivans burst back into alliance space, the Terrans and Vasudans are suddenly faced with war on two fronts. But the alliance has had a generation to prepare for the reappearance of the Shivans and has spent that time developing formidable weaponry. Has the alliance now surpassed the mysterious Shivans? What are the real motivations of the xenophobic, secessionist Terrans? Will the alliance discover a way to reestablish contact with Earth, which was lost after the events of the original game? The complex plot of FreeSpace 2 is often surprising and consistently captivating. <P> As in the original, the story unfolds in FreeSpace 2 through a combination of mission and command briefings, sporadic cutscenes, and, most effectively, through events depicted within actual missions. Gameplay in FreeSpace 2 will be very familiar to Freespace veterans, but there are several significant improvements. You\'ll still pilot fighters and bombers, but the capital ships in the game have been made considerably more dangerous. The cruisers and destroyers weren\'t exactly puny in the first game, but they\'re positively gigantic in FreeSpace 2, and unlike in many space sims, the capital ships are as deadly as their ominous size suggests. Almost all the capital ships in the game are now equipped with powerful beam weapons similar to those that were on the Shivan dreadnought, the Lucifer, in the original game. The main beam weapons are primarily used in battles between capital ships, but most of the larger ships are also stocked with smaller, anti-fighter beam weapons. Capital ships have been decked out in flak cannons as well, which let them make quick work of bombers and fighters foolish enough to wander in range. They are also still equipped with laser turrets and missile silos as in the original game, collectively making capital ships flying fortresses you\'ll learn to fear. <P> But best of all, the capital ships in FreeSpace 2 aren\'t relegated to being exotic targets for your bombing runs. Too often in space sims there\'s very little contact between opposing capital ships. However, in almost every FreeSpace 2 mission capital ships will end up clashing with each other, adding an epic feel to the overall conflict and the individual battles. It\'s highly entertaining just to sit back and watch these titans pound away at each other, ripping through each other with their tremendous beam weapons. FreeSpace 2 is the first space sim to depict epic capital-ship battles in a manner that both plausibly reflects their importance and demonstrates their raw power in an entertaining fashion. <P> It would be even less plausible if the Shivans, a race that has effectively stalked through galaxies for thousands of years, redesigned its forces every few years. Accordingly, almost all the Shivan ships encountered in the original game return in FreeSpace 2. But there\'s no shortage of new Shivan ships either, and their existence is easily justified on the basis that the Terrans and Vasudans only encountered a small portion of the Shivan forces in the original game. Ship design is just another example of how Volition has carefully crafted a believable and constantly engaging gameworld. <P> Another notable addition is the nebula in which you initially encounter the Shivans. The nebula is beautifully depicted and envelops the entire screen, limiting your line of sight and making navigation difficult. Certain areas of the nebula are subject to entertaining but harmless energy flashes, and other areas are prone to EMP pulses that completely disrupt your HUD. The graphics in Descent: Freespace garnered plenty of well-deserved accolades even though they were limited to 640x480 resolution and were consistently quite dark, but FreeSpace 2\'s graphics are fantastic. A new high-resolution 1024x768 option has been added, and 32-bit color depth is supported if you have a capable video card. The game requires 3D acceleration, but it\'s used to good effect to depict the nebula, beam weapons, flak bursts, and the most impressive explosions yet seen in a space sim. <P> Mission design is varied and almost uniformly excellent throughout the game. Objectives change in response to scripted events, and there\'s plenty of wingmen chatter to further develop the plot and give context to mission events. There are very few missions in the game that are as simple as the ""kill all the enemies you encounter"" type commonly encountered in space sims. There\'s almost always a twist or two in each mission, but the missions are beatable and almost never feel puzzle-like as they do in some other games with heavily scripted missions, such as Independence War. FreeSpace 2\'s campaign is linear, but rather than having to play each mission until you succeed, you can skip the ones you\'ve failed five times or more, which should appease gamers who are easily frustrated. <P> The game\'s interface is virtually unchanged from Descent: Freespace, but if there was ever an appropriate use for the clich ""if it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it,"" it\'s to describe Freespace\'s outstanding interface. Valuable information that is rarely displayed in space sims, such as the status of craft being escorted, is accessible at a glance. The HUD lets you instantly identify craft that are targeting your ship, the heading of missiles homing in on your ship, and your current target\'s relative orientation to your ship. The interface used by the Freespace games was clearly designed by experienced space-sim players, and as a result, it\'s just about perfect. As in the original game, the interface is also completely customizable, and you can even useyour own pilot picture for multiplayer opponents to grow to detest. And force-feedback joystick support gives afterburner thrusts a tangible feel and physically rebukes you for colliding with other craft. <P> While Descent: Freespace promised a plethora of multiplayer features, its multiplayer aspects didn\'t work well, at least not in the game\'s initial release. Online lag was a real problem, and Volition was exceedingly optimistic in contemplating 12-player conflicts. But lag is now handled much more effectively, making multiplayer battles a lot more fun, especially if you\'re fortunate enough to have a high-speed Internet connection. You can find plenty of games to join on the free Parallax Online servers, which also maintain comprehensive pilot statistics records. (Volition actually threw a couple of the pilots who had racked up the most impressive records with Descent: Freespace into one FreeSpace 2 campaign mission.) Even more interesting is the addition of Squad War, another free multiplayer service that lets squads of pilots conquer other squads\' territories, ultimately giving you the opportunity to dynamically change the gameworld in a way that massively multiplayer games have yet to permit. Finally, in addition to a lengthy campaign and the multiplayer options, FreeSpace 2 is also packaged with the latest edition of Volition\'s mission editor, which lets you craft and trade your own missions and campaigns. Very few games offer as much inherent value as FreeSpace 2. <P> All my complaints with the game are relatively minor. Wingmen and enemy AI have improved since Descent: Freespace, but they\'re still occasionally disappointing, as ships tend to collide with each other too frequently and then seem to become unable to accomplish their objectives. Capital-ship explosions aren\'t just eye candy and can be deadly to nearby fighters and bombers, but wingmen and enemies seem incapable of effectively dodging such effects. There\'s also no 800x600 resolution option, which will disappoint Voodoo2 owners in particular. If you don\'t have a powerful system and a capable video card, you\'ll have to play at 640x480 resolution, but even that resolution boasts graphics more impressive than those in Wing Commander: Prophecy or Descent: Freespace. The music and sound effects in FreeSpace 2 are both excellent, and 3D sound is well supported, although the game shipped with a bug in the A3D support. Fortunately, DirectSound can be chosen as a viable alternative. FreeSpace 2 is an outstanding game. It retains the outstanding customizability and interface of the original game and presents a more involving story and the best graphics seen in the genre to date. FreeSpace 2 also retains all the gameplay features that worked well in the original game and adds formidable new weapons, 32-bit color effects, and improved mission design. The inclusion of a variety of multiplayer options and a mission editor should also ensure that the game has plenty of longevity. Descent: Freespace was a solid game with the potential to be even greater, and that potential has been fully realized with FreeSpace 2. FreeSpace 2 is a true classic of the genre and one of the best games to be released this year.<I>--Desslock</I> <P> --<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Blade Runner - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Armed with your investigative skills and the tools of the <i>Blade Runner</i> trade, you'll be immersed in a world that lives and breathes around you with breakthrough lighting and visual effects. Your ability to survive will be put to the test."", 'Westwood Studios has been extremely vocal about how its adaptation of Ridley Scott\'s Blade Runner would revolutionize the adventure genre. Touting it as ""the first real-time adventure game"" and promising a ""constantly changing plot,"" the designers have made numerous claims about how the game\'s characters and story would be unpredictable, creating an entirely new experience. Unfortunately, almost none of the claims are true. Blade Runner is an interesting mood piece, built upon some very detailed graphic work and an interesting premise - but somewhere along the production line, someone forgot to include a game.', 'The events of Blade Runner, the game, take place in November 2019, precisely the time of Blade Runner, the film. The storyline itself is strikingly similar: You assume the role of Ray McCoy, a Blade Runner who hunts down a scourge of replicants hiding out in Los Angeles. The leader of this gang is a philosophical, brooding sort named Clovis who wants to find a way to extend his factory-provided four-year life span and sulks around, pointlessly quoting William Blake and steadfastly protecting his ""family,"" a motley assortment of other replicants. One of Blade Runner\'s ""constantly changing plot"" elements is that, with repeated playings, different characters will be replicants. And McCoy may or may not be a replicant himself (a plot element that was subtly hinted at in Scott\'s film), and every character seems to say ""What about you, McCoy?"" at some point or another.', ""The story itself is relatively static, though the course of events is slightly altered by the choices you make throughout. Most of the major events will take place no matter how you play, though the ending and the last few scenes of the game will be different (there are over a dozen different endings, but they are slight variations on three major themes). The designers have chosen a strange way to affect the plot - your behavior in the game actually affects your fate. Sympathize with the replicants, and you will turn out to be one. Kill 'em all, and you'll find commendations from your superiors at the end (a strange sort of anti-Calvinist fatalism that can send the mind reeling if pondered too long). The strange thing about Blade Runner is that there's no real way to lose, just as long as you finish the game. Although it's an interesting structure, it has its inherent problems. To justify the number of wildly different endings, the designers have tried to keep some elements of the story very vague for the bulk of the story. But even with these safeguards, there are always a number of confusing contradictions and loose ends no matter how the story winds up."", ""Despite the claims to the contrary, Blade Runner does not take place in real time (and even if it did, it wouldn't be the first - Broderbund's The Last Express came before it and actually lived up to the claim). The passage of time has no impact on the game; as in most adventure games, all events are triggered by key actions. If there's a bomb in a lab, detonation isn't an issue until you actually enter the room. If a character tells you to meet him somewhere in the game, he will immediately be at the agreed upon location and won't leave until you get there. The only actions that don't follow this trend are some random character locations, which aren't even really random. Some characters are either in one location or they aren't anywhere at all. Simply walking offscreen and returning a few times is all it takes to make them appear."", 'Technically the game is a mixed bag, combining well-rendered backgrounds with incredibly pixelated sprite-based characters. The ambient music fits comfortably with the moody environments, while the voice acting ranges from competent to downright uncomfortable (and the characters have a strange habit of repeating awkward gestures over and over again at inappropriate times).', 'Perhaps Blade Runner\'s biggest flaw, though, is its most glaring: It\'s simply not much of a game. There are only a few honest-to-goodness puzzles, and not very interesting ones at that. You get to assemble all sorts of clues and information, but, because of the automated nature of the game, it never comes into play. There\'s no real interface, just a cursor that indicates possible movement paths and changes color when you can interact with an object or character. Simply clicking on everything will take you from the opening scene to the end, with only one or two possible stumbling blocks along the way. The most interesting aspect of the gameplay is that you can use the tools of the Blade Runner trade - the Voigt-Kampff test (""you see a tortoise..."") to interrogate suspected replicants and the Esper device to enhance photographic images. And while this could have led to an interesting ""work is fun"" structure, a la Spycraft, these elements aren\'t utilized enough. Finally, the game is only a few hours in length. The first run through the game\'s four CDs won\'t take even the most inept gamer more than a dozen hours, and subsequent plays will last less than a quarter of that.', ""The designers have managed to invoke the mood of the film, re-creating a neon-lit Los Angeles constantly bombarded by rain. The perennial Blade Runner images are here, including the winking woman in the Coca-Cola billboard and vehicles flying over the flaming smokestacks of the industrial outskirts. Unfortunately, most of what's interesting about the game is exactly what was interesting about the film, and not much was done to extend the concepts or explore them any further. Fans of the film will undoubtedly overlook the game's flaws and enjoy living the life of the Blade Runner, even if it only lasts a few hours. But those who are awaiting the next generation of adventure games are advised to keep waiting. <i>--Ron Dulin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Sid Meier's Gettysburg - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Sid Meier's Gettysburg! is a real-time game, simulating one of the most dramatic battles in history. An accurate Gettysburg battlefield, 3-D units, and historically correct scenarios place you in command of either the Union or Confederate army. Challenge your friends in various multiplayer modes."", 'Sid Meier\'s Gettysburg! may be the first release from newcomer Firaxis Games, but it has all the polish and appeal of a Meier classic. This outstanding real-time wargame recreates the pivotal, three-day Civil War battle fought on the rolling terrain around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in July 1863. <P> Playing from either side of the conflict, you can take part in a single scenario or a campaign depicting the entire battle. Campaigns typically comprise seven scenarios and are dynamically strung together according to your performance in battle. For example, if you and the Confederate army can rewrite history and capture the high ground south of Gettysburg on July 1, you can earn the option of launching a fictional evening assault on Culp\'s Hill. In all, the game includes 25 predesigned scenarios, along with a random scenario option that allows for near-endless replay value. Also contributing to the game\'s replay value is the fact that no two campaigns unfold in exactly the same way. All of the scenarios are available in both single-player and multiplayer mode, but the game does not include a scenario editor. <P> Right from the start, Gettysburg! draws you in with its elegant interface and rich artwork. A nicely animated briefing prefaces each of the scenarios and adds tremendous atmosphere. Once you transition to the gameplay screen, you get more preliminary information, including a rundown of your objectives, your best troops, and the availability of reserves and reinforcements. In most scenarios, you will command a few brigades of infantry (each made up of three to five regiments) with at least one battery of artillery in support. <P> As a scenario begins, you must very quickly assess your situation and issue orders to redeploy your troops, as the default start positions are rarely effective. The clock is ticking, but the clean interface makes it easy to issue orders. To move a regiment, simply click on it and drag a line to the desired destination. You can move entire brigades this way as well, though the process is not as intuitive as it could be: You must select the brigade\'s commanding general, drag a line to the destination, then choose a formation for the brigade to assume upon reaching that spot. <P> Each unit\'s movement and fighting quality is affected by a variety of conditions, including its formation, experience, morale, and location. For example, a regiment with friendly units on either side will fight more effectively than one that is being flanked. Similarly, units ordered to charge a hill bristling with artillery will take a serious morale hit (not to mention several large, round iron hits) and will probably soon retreat in disarray. <P> Each scenario lasts about 30 minutes, but the computer will add some time at the end if one side is within striking distance of an objective. In other words, you don\'t win when you capture an objective - you win when you capture and hold it. <P> As in the real battle, the high ground is the key to victory and you won\'t have any trouble finding it on the beautifully rendered battle maps. Capturing that ground is another matter, as the AI can be quite formidable. Fortunately, the computer\'s style and effectiveness are completely customizable. Looking for a challenge? Try taking on an ""aggressive, indirect"" Confederate foe on the highest of the game\'s four difficulty settings. <P> The graphics and animation in Gettysburg! are excellent and show tremendous attention to detail. Best of all, the graphics convey a reasonably accurate sense of scale - these are huge armies we\'re talking about, after all. The sound effects are also admirable. Shots ring out, rebel yells rise above the din, and your troops will even shout out to indicate that they\'re being flanked. <P> On top of all this, the game offers excellent and apparently stable multiplayer support over TCP/IP, IPX, modem, and serial links. Simply put, this game is about as solid as the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. It has all the right ingredients to please Civil War buffs, hard-core strategy fans, and maybe even some casual gamers adventurous enough to try something new.<i>--Michael E.

Delta Force 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<I>Delta Force</I> is back. This sequel to the bestselling first-person shooter continues the storyline but gives players more control and better graphics than the original game. The Commander's Screen in <I>Delta Force 2</I> lets players choose waypoints and orders for teammates before the game begins and also lets players make changes when they discover surprises during play. Players will also enjoy some new moves, including the ability to swim and to climb ladders and the sides of some buildings. The updated <i>Voxel Space</i> game engine supports 32-bit graphics, and as a result, graphics and terrain are more realistic than ever. The increased detail allows players to hide behind rocks or in shrubs and adds environmental challenges with weather effects like rain, snow, and fog. New advanced weaponry round out this exciting game and give players the option of fighting with a silenced Heckler & Koch .45 USSOCOM, a Heckler & Koch P11, underwater rifles, time-delay grenades, and a laser designator."", ""In the original Delta Force, you played as a soldier in the US Army's elite commando and counterterrorist military force. The game overcame its graphical shortcomings by delivering top-notch action in both single- and multiplayer modes. Apparently NovaLogic was willing to bet on the same horse again, as Delta Force 2 uses yet another voxel-based graphics engine, but like its predecessor, its gameplay is good enough to buoy its less-than-stellar visuals. <P>Delta Force 2 offers around 45 single-player missions, including 25 sorties split between two campaigns and 20 stand-alone scenarios, in which you must prove yourself against large and heavily armed terrorist armies. In most cases, you'll work alone or with a handful of computer-controlled support teams. Most scenarios involve a clandestine attack-and-destroy mission against enemy bases, though many also include hostage rescue, recovery of stolen assets, and other commando-style objectives. The game also contains a powerful mission editor that lets you craft complex scenarios with relative ease and even provides thorough documentation for it. <P>The mission design in Delta Force 2 is generally excellent. Not only are most scenarios more difficult than the missions in the original, but they also seem realistic and believable. Although some are definitely influenced by Hollywood (one stand-alone mission conjured memories of the train attack scene in Lawrence of Arabia, for example), even these are a lot of fun from beginning to end. <P>Gameplay is very similar to the original Delta Force; once again, it emphasizes lots of long-range sniping punctuated by the occasional close-quarters ballet of full-auto panic fire. In many missions, you can work your way slowly towards the objective by moving and sniping until only a handful of indoor defenders remains. In other missions, time is more of a factor. Direct assaults are almost always a sure recipe for disaster, despite the game's ludicrously dangerous default mission waypoints. For this reason, most missions tend to last awhile - 30 to 45 minutes on the average. Also, you cannot save during a mission, so a lucky shot fired by the final bad guy requires you to start over from the beginning. Another potential problem is a glitch that lets some enemies see and shoot you through wooden or even stone walls. Fortunately, this bug only reared its head on a handful of missions, and always in the same place, but it will undoubtedly irk some players. <P>Yet another possible problem is the graphics engine. By using the enhanced Voxel Space 32 3D engine, NovaLogic made a design decision that adversely affected both Delta Force 2's gameplay and its viability on store shelves. Because the game uses grainy voxels instead of crisp polygons, much of the long-range combat in the game boils down to hunting for moving pixels. Also, because of the exclusively 32-bit graphics engine, Voodoo3 owners are left out in the cold: The game will only take advantage of hardware acceleration (which really only affects objects like trees, buildings, and vehicles anyway) on 3D cards based upon 32-bit graphics chips. <P>Fortunately, Delta Force 2 looks pretty good on a fast system. Even with the inherent blockiness of the voxel engine, the settings and characters look fairly lifelike. In fact, the gently rolling hills and impressive water effects make many of the maps quite beautiful, especially with 32-bit color enabled. Still, the frame rate was very choppy at 800x600 resolution on a 450-MHz Pentium II with a TNT2 card, though it looked fairly good and ran smoothly at 640x480. It took switching to a GeForce 256 card to make the game playable at 800x600. --<i>Michael E. Ryan</i><BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Full Motion Video']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['For fans of Command and Conquer, Dune 2000 is the sequel to the real-time strategy game that started it all, Dune II. In Dune 2000, you play as one of three rival ""houses"" from Frank Herbert\'s classic sci-fi book series. You can select from the Atreides, Harkonnen, or the Ordos. Each house has its own strengths and weaknesses, just like the GDI and the NOD, from C&C. Basically a port of the PC version, Dune 2000 is lackluster at best, because it is a port of a lackluster PC game. In Dune 2000, you\'re warring with the other houses over control of the spice mines, which, in typical real-time-strategy-game fashion, is the resource you must harvest to further your other causes, such as building the machines of war. Each house has its own technology tree that you must master to conquer the inevitable invading forces. Ultimately, you\'ll work your way through missions, steering you toward complete dominance of the planet Arrakis\' spice mines. Besides warring with the other houses, you must also contend with nature\'s own monstrous sandworms and with religious zealots called the Fremen. Despite the game\'s basic competence at handling the real-time action, it is at its best merely average, and at its worst impractical.  The majority of the problems facing ports of almost any RTS game are caused by the controls, have been severely compromised to fit on a PlayStation controller. Although this problem isn\'t enough to make the game unplayable, it\'s enough to make it more frustrating. PC gamers are used to hot keys and key-specific commands. When these functions are buried deep in layers of menus configured to the PlayStation controller, they simply add to what is already a traditionally complex interface. Anyone who has this game for the PC will not likely be buying it for the PlayStation, but even PlayStation owners will find the controls overly busy.  Beyond the questionable control scheme, the visuals really highlight how ill-equipped the PlayStation is at handling what are supposed to be high-resolution graphics. While the little people running around the screen are, of course, supposed to be drawn to scale, they look like sprites rendered by an Intellivision. Similarly, the backgrounds also border on monotonous, due to the desert settings. The buildings you create and the machines you construct all suffer from a loss of detail, which is further enhanced by the fact that most people will be playing this game on a normal TV. Simply put, the game isn\'t very pretty to look at. Although gameplay is king when it comes to RTS\'s, the gameplay here is painfully average, which is only exacerbated by the fact that the graphics fail to liven things up. The game is interspersed with live-action FMVs designed to draw you into the Dune 2000 world. Expect a C&C level of quality, and you won\'t walk away disappointed. Movies, sadly, are not enough to save this game from bargain-bin status. While there are 30 missions spread out among the three houses, only gamers with no other RTS recourse will find themselves playing this game, which is, in almost ironic fashion, far inferior to Westwood\'s own Command and Conquer series. If you think this game is unusual among console-based real-time strategies, it\'s not, as Blizzard\'s upcoming Starcraft 64 faces the same problems. At the present, however, Dune 2000 is its own worst enemy, and this game is suitable only for those with no other choice for some real-time action.

Warpath: Jurassic Park,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation']",{},"['Whose idea was this game, anyway? As if it weren\'t enough for the world to endure the lethargic silicon fallacy that was Primal Rage, someone then decided to create a bigger, better dinosaur trap. ""We can rebuild it. We can make it stronger. We can make the six-million-dollar dinosaur fighting game!"" This must have been the rallying cry at some forsaken boardroom meeting when discussing the fate of Warpath: Jurassic Park.  Developed by Black Ops Entertainment, those crafty code-slingers responsible for Namco\'s Treasures of the Deep and the recently released Tomorrow Never Dies, Warpath is as straight up a dinosaur-fighting game as there ever has been. While this game no doubt may have looked good on paper (get dinos together, have them slug it out, throw in a few encyclopedic touches, and there you go), it is truly horrible in practice. While the dinosaurs themselves look really nice, their surroundings (or environments) are warp-tastic adventures in texture-map glitching. Surfaces buckle and distortion abounds as the PlayStation struggles to keep all this geometry under control. The occasional graphic highlight (read: gimmick) will attempt to liven things up in the form of a human running around and waiting to be eaten or small dinosaurs walking between the combatants only to be crushed by unsympathetic dinosaur feet. Graphical guffaws aside, the fighting ""action"" is atrocious. If ever there was a game specifically designed for button mashing, then this is it. Sadly, button response time is bad. Much like elevator doors pause before closing, after you hit the button, so, too, does Warpath when you press, say, the bite button. Press the button, wait, and the dinosaur attempts to bite. The game continues like this no matter what you do, and it\'s not long before this disjointed battle of cause and effect wears out its welcome. Simply put, it\'s hard to feel any sort of control over your actions in Warpath. There are Tekken-like hold moves with which to either throttle your opponent or cause a vicious impaling move, but once again, your chances of pulling the move off when you want are hit and miss. Executing a combo of any sorts is directly linked to how fast you can whack the buttons, but even the combos gives you mixed results due to the poor collision detection. Once past the button mashing, the sound effects are insignificant, although Black Ops did a reasonable job trying to simulate ""authentic"" dinosaur sounds. While the selection of dinosaurs is decent, many are hidden at first, and it\'s quite possible that even the youngest gamer will tire of the unlocking process rather quickly. Although there is a decent dinosaur fact-file and other should-be-standard ""secrets"" waiting to be discovered, this is nothing more than a useful tool for a science class. As a game, Warpath: Jurassic Park is well past its due date. Pass with prejudice.<i>--James Mielke</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

WCW Mayhem,,"['1-4 Players', 'Multi Tap Adaptable', 'Vibration Function', 'Over 50 WCW Superstars', '12 Backstage Areas']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Awesome wrestling game for Playstation One. Rated ""T"".', 'The companies in the business of making wrestling games recently played a high-stakes game of musical chairs. Longtime WCW collaborator THQ managed to get hold of the WWF license, leaving Acclaim to sit around and talk about its secret plans for a new wrestling game. Electronic Arts stepped in and grabbed the WCW license. The company is taking the same approach to the WCW license as it has taken with most of its sports titles. The development team aimed to be as faithful to the source material as it could. The resulting game, WCW Mayhem, is a great first effort, but it still feels like a first-year title. <P>Mayhem contains loads of different rings, all based on WCW television and pay-per-view events, ranging from your basic Monday Nitro set all the way up to Souled Out and Bash at the Beach. EA has provided an entire slew of WCW wrestlers to fight in these rings. Most of the popular wrestlers are featured, including Kevin Nash, Sting, and Goldberg. The game also features a slew of midcard wrestlers, like La Parka, Rey Mysterio Jr., and Disco Inferno. As in most other wrestling games, the roster isn\'t entirely accurate (Chris Jericho and Raven are still in the game, Hogan appears in his old NWO gear, etc.) but this doesn\'t really get in the way of the game at all. <P>The main emphasis of the game is the ability it gives you to get out of the ring and fight your way to the backstage area, which is filled with chairs, tables, tasers, and other objects that you can use to bash your opponent\'s skull in. As a result, the game defaults to no-count out, pin-anywhere matches. <P>WCW Mayhem\'s gameplay is much more arcade-like than most of the wrestling games that came before it. There\'s still plenty of strategy involved, but it\'s more of the ""step out of the way of that drop kick"" variety than of the ""what move should I do next"" type. Reversals are easy to perform, but very tough to master. If your opponent hits a button to execute a move, and you hit the same button shortly after, you\'ll reverse his attack. But reversals aside, the game really boils down to who can do a move first. There aren\'t any fancy fighting-game moves here, either. Each of the four main buttons is capable of three moves, depending on which direction you\'re pressing on the controller at the time. <P>The arcade-style gameplay is a nice change of pace from the other games on the market, but it\'s not without its flaws. Rather than focus too greatly on health, the game relies on a momentum meter that tells you how well you\'re doing at any point in the match. The meter moves back and forth, and it will move toward your side when you execute impressive moves or find the time to taunt. If all the wrestlers in the match are fairly inactive, the meter will center. The more momentum you get, the harder it will be for your opponent to stop you. When your momentum meter is full, you can perform your finishing move. This allows for some good back-and-forth swings, but in actual use, it really just makes coming back from a deficit much tougher. Also, the emphasis on momentum rather than health allows for some pretty unrealistic gameplay. For instance, I can\'t imagine that Stevie Ray would be able to kick out of a pin after receiving eight consecutive Diamond Cutters. Once you and your friends have all gotten good at dodging attacks, it becomes very hard to pull off a string of moves, and the result is a stalemate match that takes forever and ends on a lucky pin after a weak move. <P>The computer player doesn\'t fall prey to that problem, though, because it\'s got problems all its own: It lacks the ability to put together a decent offense. The computer will get off a few kicks and punches from time to time, and it may even reverse a move or two if you\'ve got it set to the hardest difficulty setting. There\'s no one move you have to do - any move or hold will work. All you need to do is get off a few quick attacks at the beginning of the match. Then, after you\'ve worn the enemy wrestler down a bit, just start grappling and pulling off moves at will. It\'s possible to hit a finisher within the first 30 seconds of the match, though you won\'t be able to complete a pin until much later. The difficulty setting has less to do with how aggressive the computer plays and more to do with how long it takes to damage the other wrestler enough to successfully pin him. The PlayStation version has slightly more aggressive AI than the N64 version, but it still can\'t put up a decent fight. The computer is also very shy about getting out of the ring. If the computer player doesn\'t think it\'s close enough to attack you once you\'re both outside the ring, it will simply climb back into the ring and taunt a few times. Since one of the main points of the game is getting out of the ring and wrestling in the backstage area, this is extremely annoying. <P>The create-a-wrestler feature is nice, but it doesn\'t really touch WWF Attitude in terms of depth and choice. The textures provided are a bit more realistic than some of Attitude\'s clothing, so most of the wrestlers you create will look as though they actually belong in a ring. There\'s even a set of clothes that look a bit like Kane\'s. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Players can create characters that are truly unique with extensive combinations of visual appearance, attributes, and skill sets. A detailed and extensive system of allegiance facilitates a dimension of social game play never before experienced in a computer game. The online nature of this game provides the ability to create an evolving and dynamic adventure inside a persistent universe. The game will never be solved because there will always be more areas to explore and more quests to complete!"", ""<b>NOTE:</b>Gaming Zone membership is required to set your Asheron's Call account. A monthly service charge is applicable after your trial period ends. Zone Membership is subject to the terms of the Zone License agreement."", ""At a glance, Turbine's massively multiplayer online RPG Asheron's Call may not seem very attractive; its uninspired presentation, esoteric setting, clumsy combat system, and cluttered interface do little to recommend it over its competitors. Yet despite these weaknesses, Asheron's Call has a number of even greater strengths, and it's these strengths that let it stand both on even footing with and apart from any of its contemporaries."", ""As mentioned, Asheron's Call probably won't make a very good first impression on you, particularly if you're familiar with its competition, Origin's Ultima Online and Verant's EverQuest. Though Asheron's Call's characters' clean lines and motion-captured animation beat Ultima Online's diminutive, washed-out sprites handily, their uniformly simple, blocky models and equally simple textures can't compare with EverQuest's diverse pool of expertly textured high-fantasy inhabitants. As in Ultima Online, every single playable character in Asheron's Call is human, so you'll never be able to play as a hulking ogre or a lithe elf. You'll also never do battle with standard high-fantasy monsters; instead of fighting against dragons and ogres, you'll fight against giant insect Olthoi and catlike Drudges."", ""Asheron's Call sounds about as unassuming as it looks. For the most part, sound is sparse in Asheron's Call; other than the odd ambient sound of a wandering creature, the gust of wind produced by a magic spell, or the shouts and grunts of combat, Asheron's Call is more or less completely silent. All of these sounds are effective if nothing else, though some monsters, like the mewling drudges, sound silly; others, like the chittering mites, sound downright annoying. This isn't to say that Asheron's Call actually sounds especially bad. What little sound there is, is usually loud, crisp, and clearly indicative of the event, creature, character, or combat exchange that caused it."", ""And combat is one of the most important parts of Asheron's Call's gameplay. Unfortunately, it's nearly always marked by awkward pauses. Drawing your weapon, sheathing your weapon, or doing nearly anything else causes you to stop dead in your tracks - which can make pursuing fleeing monsters, doing battle with multiple enemies, or beating a hasty retreat of your own needlessly difficult. Fortunately, the monsters' artificial intelligence is lax enough to allow this; many monsters can be led to walls or other obstacles onto which they'll get stuck and can then easily be dispatched."", ""But there's more to combat in Asheron's Call than just jarring pauses and gullible monsters. Melee combat is actually a fairly sophisticated affair: You can choose both the speed with which and the height at which you swing your weapon. As a result, combat is much more strategic than in other games of this sort, as it factors in an enemy's weak points and the amount of stamina your character expends while fighting. And the monsters themselves can be surprisingly persistent, in spite of their sometimes-flawed behavior routines. Monsters wielding ranged weapons will draw an unerring bead on you and fire away, while those not so equipped will pursue you across some distance before they give up. Yes, unlike the unrelenting monsters of EverQuest, Asheron's Call's monsters will eventually stop chasing you if you run far enough. Though it can be said that this eliminates some of the challenge of combat, it also makes solo play in Asheron's Call much more feasible than in other games, like EverQuest, whose insanely powerful and relentlessly vindictive high-level monsters more or less require you to group with other players after a certain point. Asheron's Call offers a more complete gaming experience in this regard, since it's actually possible to play productively with companions or alone, especially if you can't seem to find a group."", ""This isn't to say that solo play is the best way to go; a good group is much more effective in slaying monsters, recovering treasure, and gaining experience points than a solo player is. To this end, Asheron's Call has two grouping systems: the fellowship and the allegiance. The fellowship is a standard adventuring party that lasts only as long as its members decide to stay together. However, the allegiance system is an innovative and completely unique means of character association. In it, characters swear fealty to other characters; these vassals provide an experience-point bonus to their lords, in whose best interests it is to help their vassals in turn, as lords receive the most bonuses from active and successful subjects. In addition, as a lord's vassal conscripts recruits of his own, that lord advances in rank and receives an even larger bonus from his subjects' activities. At worst, the allegiance system is a multilevel marketing scheme, whereby greedy, uncaring patrons enlist as many vassals as possible in order to gain large amounts of bonus experience. But at best, the allegiance system can provide a tightly knit companionship for players genuinely interested in helping others and developing an organized assembly. And should either of these social systems become confusing, unrewarding, or tiresome, you can leave them by toggling a simple on/off option buried deep within Asheron's Call's interface."", ""Once you've generated a character, you can set out to see the world, fight monsters, and gain experience points. You can use these experience points to further develop your character by spending the points on attribute and skill increases. In contrast to other games, where character advancement is mostly vertical - that is, a character's abilities are governed almost entirely by his experience level - Asheron's Call lets characters advance both vertically and laterally. In other words, gaining experience points not only increases your character's inherent power in the form of experience levels, it also lets you strengthen and develop your character's statistics and skills in exactly the way you wish. This emphasis on creating and developing a unique and powerful character is enormously different from both EverQuest and Ultima Online, where in many cases the largely fixed path of character advancement tended to result in a single best way to create, develop, and equip a particular character class, and as such, obtaining the best weapons, armor, and loot was usually more important than actually developing a character."", ""Of course, all this development and advancement require that your character do the two things that every online RPG character must do: explore and die. Fortunately, Asheron's Call handles both of these beautifully. Though traveling long distances overland and entering dungeons both require you to enter a portal (which whisks you away to your destination at the expense of load time), exploring the enormous isle of Dereth can theoretically be done in a single, continuous run, without any long and unavoidable transitional load times. If you do decide to strike out and head for a new part of the island, hit the road, or hop into a portal, then visit the nearest lifestone to set where you'll reappear after you die."", ""Asheron's Call might not seem like much at first. It doesn't have the glitter and flash of other comparable games, and at first, moving about and doing battle seem awkward and unintuitive. However, it compensates for these problems with a great deal of hidden depth, especially in terms of the enormous area to explore and the impressive number of combinations of character classes that can be created and developed in almost unlimited ways. As such, Asheron's Call is a solid, well-rounded online role-playing experience that's at least as good as any other out there. -- <i>Andrew Seyoon Park</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Xena: Warrior Princess,,['1 Player'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Though the prerelease hype made it out to be a more action-oriented sort of Tomb Raider-style adventure game, Electronic Arts' Xena: Warrior Princess has much more in common with a 3D version of hack-and-slash titles like Golden Axe. Or, still more accurately, it's essentially like Eidos' Fighting Force with a sword. <P>Playing as the television series' title character, you must rescue your companion, Gabrielle, from a fate worse than death and fight the forces responsible for her capture in the first place. The game is played from a third-person perspective and revolves around slashing, jumping, and kicking your way through a series of 3D environments. Various button combinations produce special combo moves like those seen on the show, but since mashing the buttons alone appears to work well, you won't be inclined to learn the combinations. Xena can also use power-ups, which she'll find along the way, as well as her trademark chakram (that bladed Frisbee she's always chucking around). Once you throw the chakram, the perspective switches to that of the whirling circle, which you're able to aim, after a fashion. Once it hits something, it's propelled back. The downside to using it is that Xena is defenseless while the weapon is in the air, so you've got to use it wisely when you're under fire from archers perched up above or from multiple opponents on the ground. You use the chakram to flip switches, cut chains, and pick off opponents from a distance. These opponents sometimes become tougher targets because of the hostages they keep so near to them. <P>There are minor puzzle-solving and platform-jumping sections in Xena: Warrior Princess, but the game camera keeps both from being much fun. The camera has a mind of its own at times, swinging this way and that in some situations while taking too long to catch up to your character in others. On top of that, the controls that let you adjust the camera manually feel backward and the perspective shifts too slowly to be much use in tough situations. The camera system does some things right, though, like causing obstacles and even Xena herself to go translucent when they're in the way of the action. This is one of the few pluses concerning the game's graphics. The characters in X:WP all look very blocky, and the backgrounds are basic and sparse. <P>You'll fly easily through this title if you can find the motivation to attempt it, the hardest tasks being those set by working with the camera. There are a few points, such as battling the Cyclops on the beach, that break up the monotony of the hack-and-slash nature of the game, but they're exceptions, not the rule. Ultimately, X:WP feels as though its developers were focused so intently on making the title carry mass appeal that in the end, the result is a watered-down, thin, sorry state of a game barely deserving of a rental, let alone a purchase. Like Xena? Stick to the TV show and put this one out to pasture. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 is the latest version of Microsoft\'s highly realistic, graphically advanced flight simulat or, the best-selling PC flight simulation ever produced. Microsoft has worked closely with leaders in the aviation industry: aircr aft manufacturers, training and pilot organizations, data suppliers, and flight instructors to make Flight Simulator 2000 Professi onal Edition as real as it gets. <P> Flight Simulator 2000 is the civilian flight simulator for the new millennium. Built on a foundation of realism that spans over 17 years, Flight Simulator 2000 is the largest leap forward in Microsoft Flight Simulator history. For the first time ever, we are o ffering a ""Professional"" Edition of Microsoft Flight Simulator in addition to Flight Simulator 2000. The Professional version of F light Simulator 2000 is geared to Flight Simulator enthusiasts, real pilots, those who want ""more features and more content"" and t hose who are interested in using Flight Simulator 2000 as a PC-based flight training and proficiency aid.', ""Fifteen years ago, Microsoft ruled the computer skies with Flight Simulator. More recently, the civilian flight simulation market has seen some impressive competition rise to challenge the longstanding champion, including such sims such as Looking Glass' Flight Unlimited 3 and Terminal Reality's Fly. However, in what can only be seen as good news for fans of the civilian flight sim, Microsoft has met its challengers with another superb product in the Flight Simulator line."", ""Excluding Combat Flight Simulator, the last version of Microsoft's sim was Flight Simulator 98 - and what a difference two years can make. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 is available in standard form and in what's called the professional edition. The professional edition includes two additional aircraft (the King Air 350 and Mooney Bravo), six additional cities (plus the six present in the regular edition), and various extra features, including a flight-dynamics editor. Both versions enhance Flight Simulator 98 by adding the Concorde and the Boeing 777-300, as well as updated versions of some old favorites. But the real payoff comes in two disparate aspects of the game: its graphics and documentation."", 'One of the most daunting things about the early versions of the Microsoft Flight Simulator series was the feeling that you had to do a lot of homework on your own before having any fun with the game. However, Flight Simulator 2000 includes tutorial information right in the manual and actually makes it fun. The outstanding tutorials and accompanying text take you all the way from keeping the aircraft aloft to making an ILS (instrument landing system) approach, and many details in between. There are more than 100 pages of text devoted to these tutorials, and they are supplemented by a great deal of additional material within the game itself. The text is written by Ron Machado, a professional flight instructor whose explanations are uniformly clear, informative, and even amusing. There are even tests you can take to prove your progress. The instructional part of Flight Simulator 2000 is exceedingly well done and should assuage the fears of anyone who is interested in flying but is easily daunted by a steep learning curve.', 'The greatest strength of Flight Simulator 2000 is undoubtedly the graphics. The whole series has been known for its detailed and wide-ranging terrain, and Flight Simulator 2000 ups the ante with 12 tremendously detailed cities as well as outlying terrain that also looks good, even far beyond the major urban areas. Weather effects such as clouds and lightning are equally impressive and are modeled accurately during flight. The aircraft look great, and the instrument panels remain the best in the business.', ""Although the graphics in Flight Simulator 2000 might be heaven for the flight sim enthusiast, getting them to look good has a very steep hardware requirement. The box actually says the minimum system for the game is a Pentium 166 with an optional 3D accelerator, but you'd best not even try the game with a machine that slow. In fact, you shouldn't even bother unless you have a high-end Pentium II or Pentium III, or else you'll be too bogged down by poor frame rates to care about much else."", ""If you can get it to run, you'll find that the flight models in Flight Simulator 2000 are superb and seem like improved versions of those included in the previous game, in that they are slightly less forgiving than before. The only problem is that the smaller aircraft ride too smoothly and encounter few of the continuous bumps and jolts that are experienced in such planes even in relatively calm air."", 'One of the key draws of the Flight Simulator series has always been its expandability. Users could always expect a host of third-party commercial and free add-on products in the form of additional aircraft and scenery. However, in this case, such expansions are hardly necessary, as the world of Flight Simulator 2000 is impressively detailed right out of the box. You can even join virtual airlines online and fly specified routes. Its expandability and large user base are a significant advantage that Flight Simulator 2000 has over its competitors.', ""The Flight Simulator series has quite an impressive pedigree, and the latest in the line still shows its good breeding. While its strong competition means that Microsoft's product is no longer the only great simulation out there, the reigning champion isn't yet ready to relinquish its title. If you have the hardware to run it, this simulation really stands out. -- <i>Bruce Geryk</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Carnivores - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['On a routine exploration mission in 2190 A.D., science vessel FMM UV discovered a planet with suitable climate for humankind. During the initial scouting expedition, this young planet, code-named FMM UV-32, was declared inhospitable for colony life, due to its unstable terrain and immense population of prehistoric reptiles. News of this amazing planet spread, and articles on the ""Dinosaur Planet"" lead an earth corporation to purchase the rights to the planet and create DinoHunt Corp. DinoHunt creates the opportunity for paying customers to become dinosaur hunters for the first time in 50 million years. You are the newest client of DinoHunt Corp. Each location is unique, with varying difficulties and terrain. The new hunter will be given three choices, with two more added for the advanced hunter, and a final area for the expert hunter, for a total of six locations. Keep in mind that regardless of which dinosaur you choose to hunt, there are others living on the islands that do not appear on your radar. You may be hunting a Stegosaurus and be surprised by a Velociraptor!', ""Any way you look at it, a dinosaur hunting game is a brilliant idea: It's all the action, tactics, and strategy of a true hunting simulation, with none of the guilt. Turns out, Carnivores is even more than that, more than enough to be tantalizing yet not quite complete to be entirely satisfying. Still, not only is it a solid hunting simulation, but it features first-rate graphics and sound and a fully customizable challenge that'll test the mettle of both would-be hunters and action gamers alike, even as it leaves both categories wishing there were more to the game. <P>There's a loose plot to justify why it is that you're hunting dinosaurs with high-powered weapons, but when you get right down to it, Carnivores is a simulation not unlike Deer Hunter or anything in its class. You grab yourself a gun, designate a species of dinosaur as your target, pick a place to hunt, and get to work. The dinosaurs can see, smell, and hear to varying extent, so you'll need to take heed of wind direction, keep quiet, sit still, and shoot straight if you hope to bring one home. Options like cover scent and camouflage can make life easier, but using these deducts points from your total. In a humane touch, however, using tranquilizer ammunition actually increases your score, although tranquilized dinos won't be on display in the keen 3D trophy room. You need those points to advance in rank, so that you can hunt bigger and badder dinosaurs in more challenging areas. <P>Chances are, these are going to be some of the best-looking 3D dinosaurs you've ever seen, and the best that you'll see for a while. They're big, and they look real. They go plodding about, over hills and around obstacles, stopping to graze if they like to eat plants or charging and leaping straight for your throat if they prefer meat. Shooting down the dinosaurs isn't easy and may be especially difficult against certain types that are either vulnerable only in specific regions or highly aggressive. For instance, you'll need to do better than a head shot to bring down a triceratops; you'll need to shoot him in the eye, the throat, or the back of the neck if you intend for him to fall. Meanwhile, the velociraptor demands lightning-fast reflexes and offers no second chances. If you manage to kill a target, it'll topple over dramatically, although perhaps not quite as dramatically as you might like. Shoot a dino with a tranquilizer round instead, and you can see and hear it breathing heavily as it lies paralyzed. There's quite a bit to shoot at: There are seven varieties of dinosaurs to hunt, from the meek parasaurolophus with its telltale head crest, to the small but ferocious velociraptor, to the enormous, nigh invincible tyrannosaurus rex. <P>You'll get to track these through half a dozen different environments, which look surprisingly authentic. They're mostly plains, hills, and jungles, although you also get coastal, swamp, and volcanic regions that look especially good. Everything warps underwater, and a mist hangs in the air as you trudge through the swamp, and special effects like these help make Carnivores look not just good, but great. It doesn't look perfect, though. Your field of vision isn't very far, and fleeing dinosaurs will vanish into the horizon long before they should. There's a clever use of atmospheric fog to help hide the pop-up, but it won't fool you for long. Meanwhile, you'll spot the occasional graphical glitch when a dinosaur's shadow clips through a hill, but it's nothing serious. The dinosaurs themselves will get stuck on objects once in a while, but most of the time they're every bit as smart or as stupid as you'd like to believe they were back then. There's no music in Carnivores, a decision presumably made in the interest of realism, but you get plenty of well-suited ambient sound effects to keep your ears busy. Beyond that, the dinosaurs all sound different, and although no one can be sure just what they sounded like, you'll find that their calls are both plausible and appropriate. At the same time, the three guns with which you'll shoot them sound as good as the best that first-person shooters have to offer. <P>Those guns, including a high-powered shotgun, a hi-tech crossbow, and a sniper rifle, carry varying amounts of ammunition and are ideal for specific situations. The shotgun's your best bet against small, aggressive dinosaurs, the sniper rifle's perfect for precision shooting from long range, and the X-bow is virtually silent but slow to reload, making it your best bet for stealthy kills. The weapons all look great, and they're different and effective. You'll wish, however, that there were more, and just as well wish you had even more to shoot at and more regions to explore. That's really the only shortcoming of Carnivores. Although it forces you to earn a certain number of points before you can use the sniper rifle or hunt the more advanced dinosaur species, that just seems like an artificial constraint to camouflage the game's slim content. And that'll invariably disappoint you a little, since you'll more than likely enjoy what Carnivores has to offer. <I>--Greg Kasavin </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Multiple game settings let you select such factors as your adversaries' intelligence, the size and age of the galaxy, and the level of civilization. There are multiplayer options for up to eight players. You can play using modems, a network, a hot seat, or TCP/IP. The game also includes 13 predesigned races, each with its own abilities, and the means to create your own."", ""Conquering the universe has long been a common fantasy, but it's not going to happen. At least not in our lifetime. But a virtual galaxy - that's another matter. Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares offers just such an opportunity. Be warned, however, that dominating the stars to build a galactic empire requires managing everything from scientific research to farming and mining."", 'There are many different races you can choose for this quest - even the lowly humans. Each race has its own strengths and shortcomings. If none of the offered races suit you, customize a new race by creating a profile and sets of advantages and disadvantages.', ""Master of Orion's virtual galaxy is huge, with many star systems to explore. Each system yields different types of planets. Some are very hospitable to life but lack mineral resources, others are mineral rich but toxic and void of atmosphere. You must decide which ones are worth colonizing in order to maximize the return on your investment. Some planets need the benefit of highly advanced technological breakthroughs before they reach their full potential."", 'Your scientists develop many different types of technology. Some enhance colonies, some help colonists travel faster and more efficiently, and, of course, many are militaristic in nature, helping you to better defend against (or attack) your neighbors, who also are bent on dominating the galaxy. Be careful to balance a colony and its technical advancements with a strong space fleet.', 'For combat, Master of Orion offers two options: The computer can calculate the outcome of battles based on statistical analysis, or you can take control of your own destiny using a well-detailed combat scenario. Success in the latter case requires spending a lot of time designing and outfitting ships with various systems and weapons combinations. They are ultimately customizable, allowing for a wealth of combat strategies.', ""In addition to the take-the-galaxy-by-force approach is the option of building alliances with other races through diplomacy. Establish various agreements and treaties, which, of course, may or may not be honored by one or both parties. The malicious side of diplomacy is espionage. You can send spies to other races' home worlds to steal technology or sabotage colony operations. Spies also work within your own colonies, rooting out enemy spies who have been sent by the other races."", ""Once you have colonized a good portion of the galaxy (including the legendary star system of Orion) and have defeated your enemies, you might think you've got it made. Nope. There's one last challenge before claiming victory. The Antarans (hence the name of the game) are a race of technologically advanced superbeings who were long ago banished to another dimension. During the course of the game, they find a way back into your galaxy and begin wreaking havoc everywhere they go."", 'Master of Orion has beautifully rendered graphics all around, as well as a good combat simulator and a great game concept. The star system and the scientific advances and technologies are particularly well done.', ""On the downside, it's cumbersome to keep track of which star system has which resources and buildings after you've colonized more than a few planets. Domination can quickly degenerate into micromanagement."", ""Another unfortunate aspect is the manual's lack of a getting-started chapter. There are no clues as to what the most important tasks are for building a colony or what the heck to do when you first land on a planet. The manual is merely a giant reference guide with a glut of small details to digest. The only way to figure out basic strategies is by arduous trial and error. - Wade Albright"", '<b>Good News:</b> Nice graphics. Great game concept.

Falling somewhere between the eye-bleeding complexity of games like Pax Imperia and the simplicity of Spaceward Ho!, Master of Orion was loved for the its fast-paced exploration, but beaten up by critics for its simplistic economic model, its repetitive and basic combat system, and its lack of multiplayer options. Now, four years later, SimTex has returned, like the protagonist in a Charles Atlas ad, pumped up with the gameplay equivalent of steroids, to deliver a title that no one would dare call simple. In the creatively named Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares, players will be introduced to a new level of economical, sociological, and military control - a fact that will please almost every veteran, but is almost certain to alienate new players entirely.', 'To put it bluntly, Master of Orion II is complex. Almost every aspect of the original game has been expanded, improved, and detailed to an almost unreasonable degree. One can almost picture an angry programmer muttering to himself, ""They want more gameplay options, eh? Well, they\'re going to get them. Oh yes, they\'re going to get them."" Instead of just adding three entirely new alien races to the game, the designers have gone an extra step, allowing players to design their own races, weighing advantages and disadvantages - like large home world, fantastic traders, trans-dimensional, and repulsive - to create the ultimate alien menace. Players who remember the simplistic nature of exploration in the original title (one star has one planet) will be stunned by the multiplanet star systems of MOO II. A single system can hold many colonies, each on its own planet, and often players will find themselves sharing a system with an opponent if they aren\'t thorough about colonizing ALL the planets in an area. And what about the new combat options? Ship-to-ship combat with all the extras: plenty of weapons, plenty of shields, plenty of new gizmos (including the Stellar Converter, which lets you destroy a planet!), and marines that can board your enemy\'s craft if their shields are down. Unreal. Did I mention that you can blow up entire planets?', ""Oh, and this time there's a story here too. Players will encounter the amazingly annoying Antareans, a extra-dimensional band of aliens who pop in, randomly blow the hell out of fleets and colonies, and then disappear back to their mysterious realm. To fight back, you must first defeat all of your opponents in your own galaxy and find a portal that will enable you to take your ships to another dimension. There's a plotline that explains why you're supposed to be after these little bastards, but after an entire game of suffering random losses to them, you'll want to destroy anything that even sounds Antarean. Fortunately, the Antareans are a selectable plot device, and if you get tired of losing battles in their chaotic attacks, play a game without them. By the way, you can blow up entire planets if you want."", ""In the end though, it's the multiplayer options that make this game shine. Players can go head-to-head with each other via hot-seat (up to eight players), modem (head-to-head), serial link (head-to-head), or network (up to eight again). The game plays pretty much as it did before, but with the customizable alien choices and TEN linkup capability, it can be played over and over again without losing its allure. As the sequel to a game that many gamers played for over a year anyway, MOO II begins to look like one of the season's best values."", ""Players who love strategy games will go nuts for Master of Orion II. Its detailed play options, random encounters, multiplayer options, and customizing capabilities are everything that the hard-core veteran dreams of. Unfortunately, this same complexity of design is more than most beginners will be able to tackle without becoming frustrated and confused. If you've got the tools (the game runs pretty slow on anything but a Pentium), and you've got the talent, this is the title you've been waiting for. Oh, and by the way, you can also blow up planets. <i>--Trent C. Ward</i> <br /> <i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Prepare to go to Riven--a world unlike any you\'ve ever known.', ""Myst, at more than 3.5 million units sold, is the world's most popular PC entertainment title, and after four years is still riding the top of the charts. This fact remains, despite a significant number of players who never get past the game's first tough puzzle: the rotating lighthouse."", ""For whatever reasons that Myst was such a success, Riven has a lot of the same. You'll see the same click/move/slide-show interface, along with similar mechanical and navigational puzzles and the now familiar wander and wonder gameplay. Riven's markedly improved graphics and sound further enhance the ambiance and make Riven even more immersive than its predecessor. The puzzles and problems are more cohesive, and there is more of a storyline, but in the end, Riven is only an evolutionary improvement over Myst."", 'You begin where Myst left off. Atrus (played once again by Rand Miller), the father of the two feuding sons in Myst, has another task for you: Rescue his wife from the evil clutches of Atrus\'s father Gehn, then permanently imprison Gehn in one of those ""trap"" books from Myst.', 'Your quest takes place in Riven, a fanciful world created by Gehn in the tradition of his ancestors - by simply imagining it and writing about it. Riven (from the ancient English word ""rive,"" which means ""to rip apart"") is a collection of small islands connected with catwalks, aerial trams, and a minisubmarine. You will expend much of your effort just figuring out how to get around. In many instances you\'ll find a switch in an obscure location, then take a circuitous route to the gate it opens.', ""Unlike Myst, these islands have human inhabitants, although you'll be hard-pressed to actually see any. There are plenty of spherical, earthen huts and occasional fleeting human encounters, but there is no interaction or dialogue. The oblique storyline is played out in the islands' objects and the implications you can draw from them, such as a disturbing kid's toy, a Wizard of Oz-like throne, and a frog trap. And if these are too obtuse you can always arduously pore through the voluminous journals you'll acquire."", ""Riven's two major puzzles require solving several miniproblems that in turn require close observation of Riven's denizens, colors, and unique numbering system. Gathering those elements becomes routine but just as you get comfortable with the concept there is a clever extra challenge tossed in - a missing color, a broken device, an obtusely revealed animal. Much of Riven's prerelease PR emphasized the environment as a source of clues and puzzle solutions. It is, but not to the large extent and subtle degree you may expect."", ""There are no technological breakthroughs but plenty of high-quality production values. The QuickTime animations - doors opening, levers moving, drawbridges dropping - are larger and blend well with the backgrounds, but that's principally a reflection of improvements in that display method. The sound effects are perfect and worth the price of high-end speakers, but there is no support of newer 3D audio technology. The graphics are superbly, even fanatically, detailed but that's more an aesthetic decision than a technical achievement."", ""For a game that has low-tech system demands, it consumes an inordinate amount of hard drive space - 140MB. Plus, if you play it for an extended period of time, you may encounter audio lapses. I missed a critical end-game aural clue, but after rebooting, and replaying that scene, it played just fine. Riven ships on five discs, but you can start saved games with only one of them and must click slowly through four animations before you can load a game [editor's note: This is not the only way to restore games - but it is the only intuitive way]."", ""With a walk-through in hand, Riven took only about four hours. Without it, I'd still be at it, doing a lot of wandering, mapping, and recording of my observations. And just like Myst, that's what Riven is all about: exploring a new world full of unique beings, organic machines, and family intrigue. There is no inventory, no need to combine mysterious potions, and no board game puzzles with little connection to Riven's world. Rather, it's a leisurely paced, all-encompassing, mentally challenging experience. If you enjoyed Myst, you'll thoroughly enjoy Riven. -- Jeff Sengstack <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Might and Magic VI: Mandate of Heaven,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The Ironfist Dynasty is tottering on the brink of ruin. As endless calamities plague the kingdom of Enroth, evil doomsday cultists plan to overthrow child Prince Nicolai and claim the throne for their charismatic leader. Fear grips the land and the people wonder if their sovereign has lost the Mandate of Heaven--the divine right to rule. The enemies of reason are at the gate and only extraordinary heroes can stem the tide of darkness. Will you answer the call?<P> From the depths of the deepest dungeons to the intrigues of the royal court, you lead a band of adventurers on a dangerous journey of amazing depth and intelligence. With a completely new 3-D graphics engine and a sophisticated nonlinear adventure system, <I>Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven</I> brings to life an intense role-playing experience.', 'New World Computing\'s classic Might and Magic games helped to define the subgenre that grizzled old RPG grognards now affectionately refer to as ""traditional style"" role-playing games. All of the previous Might and Magic role-playing games were set in expansive gaming worlds, filled with exotic locations, tomes of spells, armies of enemy types, and hoards of magic items. But during the past couple of years, such traditional role-playing games have been rarer than orcs in Denver. <P>The game takes place in the world of Enroth, a setting that will be familiar to veterans of the Heroes of Might and Magic spin-off strategy games. Good King Roland was apparently victorious in his battles with evil old Archibald, only to have his united lands fall prey to the ravages of an invasion of devils. When the King disappears after encountering the devilish horde, the ineffectual child prince Nicolai assumes control of the Kingdom. Your humble party of four adventurers has the onerous task of gaining the gratitude of the Kingdom\'s regional leaders, parlaying with a cryptic, omniscient Oracle in order to unravel the mystery behind Roland\'s disappearance and, along the way, carving a destructive path through a hellish legion of enemies. Welcome to the medieval jungle. <P>As with previous games in the series, Might and Magic VI is a first-person-perspective party-based game. In a minor break from Might and Magic tradition, all of your characters are human (elves need not apply), and there are only six available character classes. <P>Far more interesting is the game\'s character development system. Stomping monsters and completing quests will net your characters experience points. Gain enough experience points, and you\'ll be able to raise the levels of your characters, provided that you hook up with a capable trainer and have a few spare coins. With each increase in level, a character will gain a handful of points that can be used to increase that character\'s skills. Gain enough expertise in a particular skill, and you can train to become an expert and then a master in that skill, acquiring additional abilities in the process. <P>The graphics in Might and Magic VI are the best yet seen in a 3D first-person-perspective role-playing game. At one point in the game\'s development, hardware support for 3D graphics cards was contemplated, which certainly would have been welcome. But even without 3D acceleration, the graphics are generally crisp and clear, with a minimum of pixelation. Like prior games in the series, the graphics are also very colorful, which takes a while to get used to for those of us accustomed to somewhat more realistic, but considerably more dreary, depictions of our fantasy gaming worlds. <P>One of the best things about Might and Magic VI is that Enroth was clearly crafted with a lot of care and attention to detail. Although the game is huge, taking well over 100 hours to complete, each of the towns and dungeons was individually designed. There are tons of other little details that make Might and Magic VI special. You can fly like a Spitfire through the air and fire arrows at packs of monsters - miss them as they run by a stream, and your arrows will splash into the water. Go into a few too many shops without purchasing or selling anything, and you\'ll start to be rebuked by their keepers: ""See ya, tightwad!"" Walk into the right thieves\' guild, and you\'ll be confronted with a Monty Python-esque ""nudge, nudge, know what I mean, know what I mean...."" knowing glance from the trainer. A big metallic-looking guy loaded with vicious-looking swords who looks like a walking Ginsu knife is appropriately labeled a Cuisinart. There are some excellent sound effects as well - shoot a harpy out of the sky, and you\'ll be treated to the sound of it falling like a crumpled bird. Gargoyles shatter into pebbles. The sound of your footsteps reflects the nature of the ground you\'re walking on, whether it\'s hardened rock, fresh snow, or a damp beach. Music isn\'t used a great deal in the game, but it works well when it appears. <P>There are a few other minor disappointments. The interface is non-customizable, so you\'re stuck using the default key settings even if you find them inconvenient. Although it is basically a keyboard-controlled game, you still have to occasionally use the mouse, which is a bit cumbersome. The different geographical regions in the game don\'t quite integrate fully, meaning you\'ll occasionally be unable to loot the bodies of enemies that wandered outside of your current region. The main window for depicting the 3D gaming world is quite small, and even though there are hotkeys for all of the functions you need, there is surprisingly no ""full screen"" mode. The cutscene introduction is well done, but it feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the game, and the introductory dialogue seems like it was scripted after the cutscene was already completed. Your interaction with the nonplayer characters wandering around town is quite limited, although you can get such NPCs to tag along to grant your party additional abilities, but such NPCs won\'t otherwise directly participate in the game. You might also be disappointed with the digitized character portraits, which sometimes don\'t seem to fit in with the other animated graphics. The voice acting of your characters is also of mixed quality, although I generally enjoyed it. Each of the characters has his own distinct expressions (""Chalk up another for the big guy!""), which is another nice touch. <P>There are also a few bugs and graphical quirks. There are occasional clipping errors, which allow you to see, or even interact with, objects through walls. Certain spells, like Meteor Shower will occasionally not complete their animations if they are cast on an enemy who is on sloped terrain, causing the game to hang. Switch the game from real-time mode to turn-based while your characters are on inclined terrain, and you\'ll gradually trickle down the incline (as will monsters similarly placed). Some spells don\'t seem to work as intended - I was never able to even momentarily ""Stun"" the most ineffectual of enemies. <P>But such quirks and bugs are really quite trivial. Overall, Might and Magic VI is a remarkably stable game - one of the most bug-free role-playing games in years. Even more importantly, it\'s tremendously addictive. There always seems to be one more quest you just have to complete, one more skill you have to elevate to mastery, one more region to explore... one more night to forget to sleep before dragging yourself to work. It\'s been a long time since a Might and Magic role-playing game was released, and many gamers questioned whether or not New World Computing could recapture the magic of past games in the series. We shouldn\'t have worried. Might and Magic VI is a classically designed role-playing game that features both a huge gaming world and lots of attention to detail. It\'s a standout game in what should be a great year for role-playing game fans. Might and Magic is back, and it\'s better than ever. <I>--Desslock </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Frogger,,"['Variety of stages', 'two player alternating gameplay', 'based on the original arcade game']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Game Boy Color', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Roads and rivers can be dangerous places when you're a little amphibian trying to get home! The original arcade hit FROGGER comes to Game Boy Color. You must guide the little green guy across a street, over a river, and into the safety of his home. But you're crossing a highway in the middle of rush hour, so you'd better watch out for speedy cars and trucks that look to flatten you. Once you cross the street, you'll have to get across the river, which is filled with floating logs. Some of those logs are crocodiles though, so be careful you don't end up as someone's midday snack. You'll also have to look out for snakes and turtles, which can also ruin your day. Along the way, you can gobble up some flies and rescue other frogs to earn some extra points. As the game progresses traffic moves faster, the river rages harder, and everything gets a lot more dangerous! FROGGER is compatible with all existing Game Boy systems."", 'Why has it taken this long for Frogger to hit the Game Boy? You would think that with all the other old arcade conversions to have come out, Frogger would have been given the Game Boy treatment ages ago. Some would say that good things come to those who wait, while others would argue that things that are almost 20 years old aren\'t good anymore. Frogger is one of those gaming archetypes that has remained basically unaltered since it made its coin-op debut, which, as last year\'s unsuccessful PC and PlayStation remix proved, is for a reason. The aim of the game is to get five frogs to their homes at the top of the screen within a specified time limit. In between you and your goal is a highway full of speeding motor vehicles and a river that contains moving logs, turtles, and nasty crocodiles. You must navigate your way to the top of the screen without getting run over by cars, bitten by snakes, drowning in the water (how? can\'t frogs swim?), or otherwise coming to harm. Bonuses are awarded for collecting other frogs that are stranded on logs, collecting butterflies, and getting your frog home with plenty of time remaining. Once all the frog homes are filled, the level is complete, and you\'re whisked away to the next stage, which is mainly identical except the difficulty level increases slightly. And that\'s Frogger, basically. While it\'s good to see the original gameplay intact, it\'s a bit much to ask Game Boy owners to shell out money for what is basically an above-average conversion of an ancient arcade game. Admittedly, the good use of color makes Frogger look pretty close to the original, but you can\'t escape the nagging feeling that more could have been done with the graphics. Sprites lack animation, and the presentation is minimal at best, with drab title screens and incredibly sparse music pieces, which are note-for-note renditions of the coin-op\'s soundtrack. This sensation of disappointment extends to the levels, which don\'t offer much in the way of variation - just the same highway/river layout over and over again, with increasingly fast objects and new unfriendly creatures. Not straying from the original design is one thing, but a complete lack of imagination is another. Sure, Frogger is still immensely playable. It\'s one of those games that you get a little bit further into each time, and each session teaches small strategies and tips that make getting your name on the high-score table easier. The sheer addictiveness of the game makes it very easy to fall into the ""just one more game"" trap, while the simple design lets anyone play for five minutes while waiting for the bus. Those two elements are the hallmarks of a classic Game Boy game and make Frogger, despite some drawbacks, a recommended purchase. <I>--Cameron Davis </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Alice in Wonderland,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Game Boy Color', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Based on Disney\'s 1951 animated feature <a href=""/exec/obidos/asin/B00004R99K/${0}"">film</a> (which was itself based upon the 1865 Lewis Carroll story), <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> is a side-scrolling, platform-style action game that will take you through more than 20 surreal levels. You play as Alice, of course, and you\'ll start by chasing the illusive white rabbit down a hole into Wonderland, where you\'ll avoid all sorts of obstacles as you fall. You\'ll need to find the right shrinking and growth potions to allow you access to further levels, and, following the film\'s arc closely, you\'ll eventually meet the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Queen of Hearts, and her army of playing-card soldiers.', ""Almost fifty years ago, Walt Disney brought Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland to life on the big screen. Featuring an outlandish story and visuals to match, it is no wonder that - even by today's standards - Alice remains one the most beautiful animated films of all time. Out of all the consoles on the market, one might think that a console such as the Game Boy Color would be the least technologically capable of re-creating the lush world of Wonderland. The developer Digital Eclipse is out to prove anyone who thinks that is the case wrong. In execution, Alice offers some of the best graphics and gameplay ever seen on a portable system. In recent years, many Disney films have found their way to home consoles, single-handedly creating a genre of their own - the Disney platformer. Alice takes this formula a step further by not only offering simple side-scrolling action, but also an isometric view that kicks in once Alice reaches the main Wonderland area. In addition to single-player action, you can team up with a friend to take turns searching for the mysterious White Rabbit or use the optional Game Boy Printer to use Alice's Art Gallery, where you can arrange pictures of characters from the game and print them out."", ""Utilizing detailed cutscenes to carry the story along, this game follows the film's story to perfection. Beginning with Alice's descent down the rabbit hole, young and old alike will have no problem jumping right into the simple gameplay. While some sequences may prove to be frustrating at times, anyone with a small amount of patience should be able to enjoy the game all the way through."", 'During the course of the game, Alice will meet up with all of the major characters from the movie on the overhead-view Wonderland map. For the most part, these familiar faces have lost an item, and upon talking to them, Alice will volunteer her services to find what they are looking for. During these side-scrolling adventures, Alice is on the lookout for not only these hidden items, but the also the obligatory keys to open locked doors and, of course, magic mushrooms to shrink her down to tiny proportions so she can squeeze through small passageways.', ""Graphically, Alice is one of the most impressive Game Boy games of all time. Digital Eclipse has outdone itself in immersing the gamer in a world exactly like the movie, and it has pushed the hardware to its fullest, offering animated backgrounds and nearly every color in the handheld's palette. To add to the stunning visuals of the game, Alice and her Wonderland friends and enemies are also wonderfully animated, and they move almost exactly like they do in the film."", ""While Alice may be visually outstanding, the sound leaves a little to be desired. Most of the in-game music is kept simple and to the point. It gets the job done, but it's not nearly as impressive as the lush visuals of the game. It should be noted that this leaves only a small smudge on the game itself."", 'On the whole, Alice in Wonderland is an amazing Game Boy game. It offers some of the best graphics and animation ever for this system and should not be missed. Players running the gamut from novice to expert should thoroughly enjoy the game. In fact, it stands to leave a lasting impression, much like the film itself.<i>--Tim Tracy</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Tarzan,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['cartridge only', 'Several months after Sony shipped Tarzan for the PlayStation, Activision released the same game to Nintendo 64 owners, perhaps in an attempt to satisfy those N64 fans who might have heard that the earlier Disney animated-film-to-game translation actually fared quite well. In both versions, gameplay is fun, diverse, and not just a cross-media no-brainier licensing affair. However, the N64 game does fall short of the previous version, in a couple of areas that do not necessarily impair the overall quality of the game. But first, on to the details. The single-player platform game follows the recently released animated film\'s plot exactly, and that\'s a very good thing, as the movie\'s pacing is conducive to the challenges you expect from a video game. Actually, what Tarzan captures, surprisingly, is the simplicity (with challenge) found in classic games. You play as Tarzan most of the time, first as the young ape-man in training and then later as the perpetually ""prime of life"" Tarzan. When you\'re not playing as Tarzan, you\'re running through the jungle as Jane, in a Victorian dress, attempting to flee a pack of baboons, or you\'re tearing up the campsite as Terk, Tarzan\'s she-ape companion.  There are 14 levels in all, and, surprisingly, each level and the objective therein is strikingly different from one another. Sure, there are conventions that reoccur in some levels, such as swinging on vines or sliding along fallen trees. However, these consistent features contribute to your overall grasp of the gameplay and become more demanding as you proceed (yes, demanding, on anything other than the ""easy"" setting, which is insanely novice, yet good for beginning gamers, no doubt). About half the levels are composed of standard 2D platform jumping, while you grab items and avoid animals until you reach the end. The rest of the levels take advantage of action scenes in the movie. In the Stampede level, for example, you control Tarzan as he runs ahead of a pack of elephants Crash Bandicoot- or Herc\'s Adventures-style. You move from side to side and jump when necessary. This parallels the stampede scene in the movie. In the SaborAttacks level, you fight the leopard, Sabor, with a spear and with tricky jumping moves a number of times until you conquer him, just as in the film. The aforementioned event with Jane is the Baboon Chase level, which follows the movie so closely that it has Tarzan swinging in to save you, hence navigating the chase at that point. Bonus levels exist as well. To earn one, you must collect four pieces of Jane\'s baboon drawings scattered around the environment. If you do so, you\'ll glide down a stream on a raft, grabbing tokens and fruits until the timer runs out, or you\'ll ride through the jungle on a stork, doing the same, or you\'ll slide along the fallen trees in the style of Crystal Dynamics\' Pandemonium, ducking limbs and jumping over others. What\'s the point of tokens and fruit? It\'s all pretty intuitive. The tokens, in lots of 100, give you an extra life, and the fruits (yellow, purple, red, and blue of varying strengths and availability), are for you to lob at animals that get in your way. You\'ll also pick up other objects, such as a stone blade, to use against close-range predators. Bananas are used to increase your health meter and are pretty readily available throughout the game. If you collect all the letters in Tarzan\'s name (also scattered throughout each level), you open up movies that move the game forward. Worthy of mentioning, too, is the fact that you can go back and replay saved levels, should you want to find all the tokens, drawing pieces, or letters to gain extra lives (necessary for some of the later levels) or acquire a better ending score. One problem with the N64 Tarzan is that the controls aren\'t the greatest. The PlayStation version was moderately plagued by similar shortcomings, yet the N64 stick does not respond well to climbing, swinging, or fighting tigers. In fact, the analog offers entirely too much freedom - a feature that Tarzan gameplay doesn\'t require. Stick with the D-pad or nothing, for the most part, through most of this game. You\'ll usually deal with the animals (sometimes your enemies, sometimes there to give you a lift) immediately, but if you don\'t, you\'ll discover fairly quickly that the AI isn\'t too swift. In most cases, the animals are predictable and can be dispelled with fruit bombs or avoided altogether with little effort - with the exception of the evil, evil birds. We also noticed that the collision is occasionally laughable. Several times we managed to use our knife, which is more of a handheld stone blade, to dispose of pesky animals without even making contact with them. But this wasn\'t a repeated offense, so it\'s forgivable, considering the game\'s strong points.  In the sensory areas, Tarzan doesn\'t really look too fantastic on the N64. The PlayStation version (all hail the disc!) offers animated cutscenes from the movie to progress the plot along, while the N64 version tosses you into the gameplay, so as a result the N64 game doesn\'t have the same degree of plot coherence. Some slowdown is apparent if too much action is happening on the screen, which can be annoying on levels such as the Baboon Chase, wherein you\'re trying to knock apes out of your way as you run from baboons and avoid other obstacles. In a word, consistency in speed is mandatory to get through such challenges successfully. Also, the N64 cart doesn\'t support the rich sound you expect. It\'s somewhat muddled-sounding.  However, all in all, Tarzan on the N64 is a pleasant surprise that rises from its rough spots with a fair amount of success. While the game is not particularly mind-stumping or sophisticated, it is challenging and does require a good amount of skill, whether in jumping from place to place, knowing where hidden items might be, or fighting belligerent leopards who lunge a lot. Even if movie-license games turn you off, this game is an exception and worth taking a look at. If you can\'t stand Disney and have no interest in the franchise, this game is still worth looking at.   <I>--Lauren Fielder </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Bomberman Hero,,['Classic Bomberman game for N64!!'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"[""Let's face it. Hudson Soft's been on a tear recently with its Bomberman franchise. First it was Saturn Bomberman, then it was the rendered/isometric Bomberman World on the PlayStation, followed by Bomberman 64, Bomberman Fight for the Saturn, and Bomberman Wars for the Saturn and PlayStation. Now, Hudson's back again with yet another game featuring its explosive mascot, this one for the N64."", 'Making its appearance surprisingly soon after the release of Bomberman 64, Bomberman Hero once again places our bombastic buddy in the role of platform protagonist. Your duty is to rescue the Princess So and So (sound familiar?) from the clutches of the evil blah blah blah and to restore peace to such and such (actually Queen Millie Ann, Nitoros, and BomberWorld, in that order). Bomberman Hero spans five distinct worlds, separated into sections, each designed to test your platforming abilities.', ""Despite the uninspired plotline, Bomberman Hero is a rather surprising success. In a departure from Bomberman 64, Bomberman Hero boasts a number of new gameplay features that make this a completely new Bomberman game. In a move that will shock and perhaps even alienate hard-core Bomberman fans, Bomberman Hero has absolutely no multiplayer feature, and after Bomberman 64's lackluster attempt, that might not be such a bad thing. For those not so concerned with Bomberman's legacy, they get a solid, if unoriginal platformer to wrestle with. If anything, it almost comes off as a cross between Sonic 3D Blast and Crash Bandicoot 2. As it turns out, Bomberman Hero is one part platformer and one part adventure game, and with it comes a host of new moves to help Bomberman save the Queen. For instance, Bomberman can now jump. In addition to jumping, he can also grab and hang from ledges, which comes in handy after a badly timed jump or an unfortunate fall off a cliff. Bomberman has also inherited a life bar. No more one-hit deaths. During the course of the game, a number of levels will appear requiring Bomberman to utilize special attachments suited to the stage at hand. These devices include the BomberCopter, BomberJet, BomberMarine, and BomberSlider as well as an appearance by Lui the Kangaroo. Each has its own feel and style of control."", ""Nevertheless, it wouldn't be Bomberman if he wasn't throwing bombs, and throw he does. All kinds of bombs in fact. In addition to merely throwing bombs, you can increase the amount of bombs thrown (up to four) as well as the diameter of the explosion. For the intrepid explorer, various power-ups lie in wait, such as the remote bomb, freeze bomb, salt bomb (for slugs), and power glove. Depending on the enemy and its elevation, Bomberman will be required to either throw or kick the bombs at his foe. In a situation where more than one enemy approaches, by holding down the attack button, Bomberman will slowly begin to wind up his arm until it resembles a windmill at full speed and then release up to four bombs in one throw. It's this variety of new (for Bomberman) features that refreshes and invigorates what would have been overly stale gameplay. How many people wish that Mega Man could simply duck?"", ""Visually, Bomberman Hero is everything you could expect it to be. All platformers should look this good. Bomberman himself is fully rendered in polygons and animated beautifully, as are the numerous enemies and boss characters. The backgrounds have been thoughtfully designed and are solidly constructed, glitch-free, and graphically lush. Even explosions look great as shock waves litter the screen with each bomb thrown. Hudson Soft has managed to create a crisp and vibrant world, saturated with detail and gorgeous effects, all while avoiding the overly blurry look associated with most N64 games. Cutscenes, which reveal the storyline, have a hi-res look to them that complements the game nicely. The expressions on Bomberman's face are worth the price of admission alone."", ""Musically, Bomberman Hero's soundtrack is reminiscent of the one found on Saturn Bomberman, a mix comprising assorted techno and drum n' bass tracks. Sound effects, while not setting any new sonic benchmarks, are also well represented."", ""Unfortunately, even with a game that does as many things right as Bomberman Hero does, there are still bound to be problems. Camera control, unlike Bomberman 64, cannot be rotated 360 degrees. Instead, Bomberman Hero uses a fixed camera position, which can be tilted slightly. Too slight, regrettably, to be of any use. The camera angle also presents some mild problems in aligning platform jumps. This can be especially tricky when jumping onto a moving platform when coupled with the sensitive analog control. The game also experiences slowdown, which can lead to awkward timing during those same tricky jumps. However, most of these are technical issues that tend to disappear once you learn to compensate. The thing that won't disappear so easily is the distinct lack of challenge. Enemies are usually nothing more than obstacles waiting to be blown up. The only time the game gets even remotely difficult is when facing the bosses, and even that's not so difficult. More formality than formidable. Another sensation that's hard to escape, despite the graphical triumphs and the ease of the gameplay, is a certain feeling of pointlessness. The weak premise merely seems like a crappy excuse to put some levels together and have the gamer go through the motions. Run through levels, trigger switches, find exit, rescue Queen. Whatever. Once completed, you'd be hard-pressed to pick up the game for another go."", ""In the end, what Hudson Soft has come up with this time is truly a mixed blessing. If you can get past the fact that Bomberman Hero is an above average platform game and nothing else, you'll probably have a pretty good time. It's good looking, easy to play, and perversely satisfying. Who doesn't get a kick out of blowing up everything in sight? Add to that the fact that Bomberman just looks so cool in 3D, and you might have a winner. However, if you're the kind of gamer who wants a little meat with his potatoes, you might want to pass. Super Mario this is not. Maybe Hudson Soft should slow down a little. With Bomberman Hero, it was on to a good thing, but you just can't shake the feeling that given a little more time, Hudson Soft could have taken something good and turned it into something great. Maybe next time. --James Mielke <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Beyond that, well... it\'s not a bad game, it just comes up a little short of our expectations. Its primary flaw is oversimplicity on all fronts. In an era when the best RPGs offer complex plotlines with flashbacks and time skips, betrayals and new alliances, Quest 64\'s plot seems skeletal and obvious. Though rendered in 3D, gameplay adheres to a very linear model that takes little advantage of 3D\'s inherent ""explorability."" Quest 64 falls short of both Mario 64\'s expansive 3D play and Final Fantasy VII\'s compelling twists and turns.', ""Like any good fantasy story, Quest 64's once-great-and-peaceful land is now in peril.

It's your quest to find it and him. Along the way, you'll fight monsters and gain prowess at wielding the powers of earth, air, fire, and water - nothing terrifically new here, but a fair enough premise."", ""The game runs into trouble with the rigid way it adheres to its goal. We watch Brian go from town to town, without straying too far from the (single) road. He doesn't because he can't, since the surrounding terrain usually only goes back about 20 feet. Mario 64's environments were much more adept in their utilization of 3D, not just as an immediate spatial reality - gee whiz I can walk around stuff instead of through it - but as a model for gameplay. Mario's levels were large open spaces that encouraged and rewarded exploration rather than connect-the-dots pathways with sporadic secret areas. Exploration is much more enticing in a game that really makes use of the potential of 3D. Unfortunately, we're still waiting for a true RPG application of this concept for the N64."", 'Quest 64\'s individual puzzles and challenges are similarly straightforward. Go to Town #1.

Your reward? Unique Elemental Magic Item #1, which happens to be an Earth Talisman, with the implication of three more like it. While it\'s not entirely that simple, that\'s not too far off from the truth either, so be prepared for a lot of towns with ten rooms, five of which will be empty, and mazes about as labyrinthine as a bridge.', ""Quest 64 does look and sound pretty good. Not quite up to Mario standards, but the graphics are clean and fast and there's a fair share of nice texture mapping. The light sourcing in the forests and caves makes for some visually spooky moments. Unfortunately, the town scenes are plagued by wall clipping. And in combat, the trees are always getting in the way. Sure there's a Rotate View button, but in combat mode it returns to the default view when you let go, and you can't simultaneously rotate your view and perform another action. The only thing to be done is to peek, memorize, and take blind stabs at your foes. The game's music is varied throughout the game. It's of the cutesy music box variety for the most part, again raising demographic questions about the N64."", ""These days, we've come to demand fast-paced action from an RPG's combat system. Aside from some problems with view, Quest 64's turn-based combat control is terrific. It's smooth, simple, and easy to learn. The game makes great use of the C-buttons as the four elements, which correspond to four separate schools of magic, with ten-plus spells in each once you gain some experience, all available with a minimum of button pushing. Oddly, regardless of the size of the enemy party, it's only allowed one attack for each of your attacks. Thus five monsters only pose the tactical threat of one big one. For that matter, they're actually easier to kill, since the monsters attack in turns - regardless of proximity, range of attack, or power level, they just rotate through their roster. By keeping the weak ones alive until the end of a fight, you effectively cripple their offense."", ""A lot of people were hoping that Quest 64 was going to be the N64's answer to Final Fantasy VII, but it falls short of that lofty achievement. On close inspection, FFVII possesses similar linear game dynamics and rail-like motion control - there are large open spaces, sure, but many individual areas are just fancy-looking straightaways. So why is Square's giant seller so much better? For one, the cutscenes. Three disks' worth. Admit it, they're gorgeous, and they suck you right into the amazing plotline. Mystery, evil, betrayal, hope, and a certain morbid fascination - think of the two-plus million jaws that must've dropped worldwide when the falling platform destroyed the Midgar slum. Quest 64 is just way too familiar and straight-ahead. Plus, FFVII is replete with side plots and red herrings to distract you from your primary goal. In Quest 64 you just keep on truckin', for better or for worse. While part of this could be blamed on the restrictions of the cart format, Quest 64 manages to fall short in almost every possible way. --Josh Smith <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Just remember: this game will be king of Nintendo's jungle for quite a while and, with a few million rabid fans, could enter the ranks of classic Nintendo 64 games. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", 'If Mario is Nintendo\'s Luke Skywalker, then it\'s safe to say that Donkey Kong is Nintendo\'s Darth Vader. Originally cast as the primate villain in the Donkey Kong arcade game back in the early \'80s, Kong and his many descendants have stepped away from the ""dark side"" and become forces for good. While it\'s genetically unlikely that Kong is Mario\'s father, it\'s been well documented that Kong and company have been enlisted to rescue Nintendo in times of trouble. Remember when the Super NES was ""threatened"" by Sega\'s 32-bit/CD add-on hype? A game called Donkey Kong Country came out, featuring prerendered graphics never before seen on a home console. Not only did it breathe new life into the Super NES\' sales, it spawned a profitable series that kept Nintendo\'s 16-bit scene alive for years to come. Fast forward to 1999. Sega and Sony again threaten the Nintendo 64 with superior game consoles, and once again Nintendo calls on Kong\'s descendants to breathe new life into its 64-bit system with Donkey Kong 64. While this much-anticipated 3D adventure game has high-quality gameplay and plenty of variety to fuel Nintendo\'s sales this holiday season, it lacks enough ""wow factor"" to exert the revolutionary influence that Donkey Kong Country had. Donkey Kong 64 starts with a well-worn storyline: Donkey Kong\'s isle of paradise faces destruction by an invading K.Rool and his crocodile Kremlings. Donkey now has four friends to help him defeat K.Rool: Diddy Kong, his perennial sidekick; Lanky Kong, an ape with super-stretchy limbs; Tiny Kong, a teenybopper who can shrink to fit into small holes; and Chunky Kong, a muscle-bound lunkhead who can lift boulders and smash down doors. Veterans of the Donkey Kong series will also note the return of old-timers like Cranky, Funky, and Candy, all of whom upgrade the Kongs with new abilities, hints, shooting weapons, and musical instruments that help unlock hidden areas. For the most part, Donkey Kong 64 is an explore-and-collect adventure. Those who obtain perverse pleasure from collecting every last coin and item in this type of game will be titillated - and those who don\'t will be frustrated. The main thrust is to find 200 golden bananas in the main world and in the seemingly standard individual stages: an underwater level, a forest level, a jungle level, an industrial level, etc. As expected, almost none of these bananas are in plain view - multipart puzzles and obstacles impede the way to these treasures. However, there\'s plenty more to collect: regular bananas, fairies (which you must take pictures of with a camera), banana medals, super-secret Rareware coins, blueprint pieces (found by defeating certain enemies), crowns (to unlock multiplayer games) and boss keys (to unlock new areas on the island). Now, factor in that each of the five characters must find some of these items individually: Devoted gamers will see this as added replay value, while others will see it as a royal pain in the Donkey derriere. If that weren\'t enough, it seems the developers threw every gameplay style they could think of into the mix. This gameplay variety is perhaps this title\'s main strength, although the quality of the games varies. For starters, the game has a separate two-to four-player mode, with games such as a battle arena, where Kongs can beat up each other in a circular ring, or a GoldenEye-type shooting game. In the adventure mode, you earn golden bananas by completing mini-bonus games. Some are true games in their own right, such as a racing track, race-boat water course, or mine-cart roller coaster - all of which look impressive in 3D. Some of these games are less visually impressive but are entertaining nevertheless, such as a maze where the Kong must avoid enemy detection, or a bug splattering stage. The remaining games - such as a simple target-shooting session or a slot machine - are either run-of-the-mill or too easy to sustain long-term interest. Finally, a couple of bonus games are direct translations of old-school titles, including a partial version of the original Donkey Kong arcade game that\'ll bring back memories for some. Since the Kongs learn unique abilities as the game progresses, some Kongs have special stages, as well. Remember the barrel-blast levels in the 16-bit games? Donkey now plays them in 3D with a target sight. As the barrel moves, you can shoot Donkey out to other barrels. Diddy gets a jet pack that lets him complete some flying stages, while the other three characters learn other impressive skills, such as shrinking (Tiny), climbing up steep slopes (Lanky), and lifting or breaking heavy objects (Chunky). If that weren\'t enough, some characters can transform into animals, such as a rhino or a swordfish, to break into boxes or secret areas and kill bothersome enemies.<i>--Nelson Taruc</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Bomberman 64,,['One of the great N64 games'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['One of the great N64 games', 'Bomberman is easily the most prolific character in video game history, having appeared in titles for every major system since the original NES - and with multiple versions on quite a few. And yet with so many installations, every game until now (with the dubious exception of Panic Bomber on the Virtual Boy) has maintained the same premise: The player plays as a little robot who tries to be the bomb he throws. The robot character drops bombs to clear his way through the playing field\'s blockades and obstacles, attempting to blow up his enemies all the while. But if he doesn\'t run like hell to get away from the blast, he\'ll go up in smoke as well. Besides obviously clearing pathways, the advantage to blowing up obstacles is that power-up items appear from within the wreckage that either help or hinder him. These power-ups include the kick boot (to propel the bomb forward), the glove (to chuck the bombs airborne), fire (to expand their blast radius), extra bombs (the more the merrier), or the dreaded skull icon, which grants the formidable Bomberhea (which is kind of like red kryptonite to Superman, giving a different disruptive effect with each exposure).  <P>Since the introduction of the multiplayer battle mode (wherein you and all the way up to nine of your friends can face off against each other), the game hasn\'t changed much over the years. Not many fans have minded though, since multiplayer challenges have been so incredibly addictive that the arrival of a new version of the game probably let them finally put their old system (and game) into the closet. Now the latest Bomberman game has arrived for the Nintendo 64, and it\'s found many old fans fearing change. <P>Visually, the game is a Super Mario 64 3D face-lift of the series, though the theme of the one-player scenario is much the same. Bomberman attempts four different elemental worlds (each with its own sub-boss), before going after the main baddie who threatens the overall Planet Bomber - though now the game fields are wide-open SM64-like spaces instead of the once closely confined quarters. Besides the perspective and control change, the bomb dynamic has been altered as well. Instead of starting with a single ""drop bomb"" move, you have the loaded Bomberman model, as he can now immediately kick, throw, or power up bombs into huge bombs, without the need for obtained power-ups. But since hardly anyone really played single-player Bomberman games before anyway, these changes aren\'t likely to raise anyone\'s hackles. Especially since the single-player mode is pretty improved over past games now that it\'s made the leap to 3D.  <P>But the multiplayer mode has gone through a few changes as well, and therein lies the rub. In previous titles, you and your opponents would begin each round cornered into different areas of the play field. You\'d then drop bombs to clear your way through to your enemies, hopefully coming across a few power-ups on the trail. In Bomberman 64, the arenas are wide open, and you can begin attacking opponents from the get-go. There are far fewer power-ups to be had, though they\'re pretty unnecessary since most of them are built-in (the kick boot used to be a coveted item, now everyone\'s wearing them). Now, the game dynamic seems to be that instead of cornering your opponents with a bomb (now impossible due to the large, open playing field), you must stun them momentarily by directly hitting them with a bomb, hoping it will explode nearby while they\'re still passed out. Another change is that once you ""die,"" you turn into a ghost (kind of like being a mobile bomb in the multiplayer arena mode of Super Mario Kart 64). You can then hop onto the surviving opponents, slowing them down for a few moments and possibly getting them killed by a blast in the process. An explosive multiplayer take on capture-the-flag has also been included, which is worth mentioning, but only in passing. <P>Of course, change in and of itself isn\'t bad. The most important meter is the fun, so the question remains, is the game still fun? Well, the single-player mode is passably entertaining, but it\'s still a stretch away from being ""must-play TV."" And while it may look a bit like Super Mario 64 (with all the perspective problems that entails), it\'s clearly no Mario. The multiplayer mode is... sort of fun, though it\'s certainly lost all the addictive charm that so positively defined the series. And sadly, because of that, the game just doesn\'t seem like Bomberman anymore. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Doom 64,,['Game Cartridge Only.'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['slight damage to front label', 'Doom set the standard for first-person shooters when it hit PCs in 1993. Since then, we\'ve seen versions for every system that could handle it, from Sony\'s PlayStation to Sega\'s ill-conceived 32X add-on, with varying results. While most would argue that Doom is finally dead, Midway is attempting to keep the series alive with its latest release, Doom 64 for the N64. While it\'s probably the best version to date, it pales in comparison to id Software\'s follow-up, Quake, which currently looms on the console horizon. <P>Doom 64 picks up where all the other Doom games left off. After tearing through space, hell, and wherever else your Space Marine was sent, you thought that the threat of the demons was finally past. Of course, one survived, and it is currently reanimating all of the fallen monsters in a last-ditch attempt to revitalize their evil mission. Your task is to finally rid the universe of all the crazy hellions - from the dead guy with the pistol to the rocket-spewing Cyberdemon. <P>Of all the changes made for the N64 version, the upgraded graphics are perhaps the most striking. There are new images and texture maps for every weapon, monster, and wall. Every character looks crisp and maintains his sharpness at close range - finally removing the pixelation that previous versions have suffered from. True lightsourcing has also been added, so colored lights and shadows permeate the game\'s 30-plus levels. The sound has also been tweaked and now boasts a few new death screams and a hauntingly ambient soundtrack. Thrown in (seemingly) as an afterthought is a new weapon, the laser, which proves to be next to useless and is nowhere near as cool as it\'s made out to be. <P>The basic rules have been adjusted as well. Some changes are major - the switch system is no longer a ""flip once"" process - some are now used for multiple openings and must be returned to more than once. Several items teleport in now, making it much harder to find keys and other power-ups integral to completing the game. The minor changes, while not noticeable to everyone, will surely bother hard-core Doom fans. For instance, now that the engine is true 3-D, rooms can exist on top of each other - gone are the gratuitous staircases and ramps that dominated the original. It\'s almost as if the design team set out to make people re-think what Doom was capable of doing. While no one could argue that this is an unworthy ambition, if the team was prepared to make minor, annoying changes to the game, then why couldn\'t they throw in completely new features like jumping or the ability to look up and down. Better yet - why not just make an entirely new game instead? Play control remains the same in Doom 64 but seems somewhat restrictive when compared to that of the PC version. The analog stick enables you to force your Marine along at several different speeds - but it never feels quite right. In fact, this sense of being \'wrong\' permeates the entire title. On paper, Doom 64 sounds better than the original could ever hope to be, but the end result feels more like a bastardization of the original. <P>Uninitiated or casual Doom players may get a kick out of Doom 64 - the graphics are fairly impressive and the game still has a spooky atmosphere. But anyone who has downloaded custom WADs for the PC with new levels, graphics, and sounds has already seen greater things from the world of Doom. Sigh... yet another mediocre N64 game. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Now there are three ways to play it. Locate and destroy the enemy while real-time video displays your hits and misses. Take charge of naval fleets equipped with cruise missiles, torpedoes, and NAVCOM surveillance systems in advanced play. Your radar blinks. Think fast! The survival of your fleet hangs in the balance.', '""You sank my battleship!"" Ah, the sounds of childhood Saturday afternoons and a really memorable ad campaign. Dense blue plastic, knobby little red and white pieces (which the dog always tried to eat), and really strategic guesswork. Now that was fun. <P> Rather than simply relying on nostalgia to sell games, Hasbro develops, tweaks, adds, and replots the game until you have not only the standard Battleship, but also World Domination mode, air warfare, naval warfare, helicopters to fly, islands to defend, oil rigs to protect, and enemy submarines to torpedo. Some great visuals accompany an intuitive interface and suddenly the game of childhood afternoons becomes the one of I-really-should-be-working adult afternoons. This is a strategic, real-time wargame, and one thoughtful enough to include both host and guest CDs so you\'ll always be able to attack your friends. <P> While there can be no doubt that Hasbro has added extraordinary depth to this game, there is one big, fundamental flaw: the ""Classic"" game. This is the game you\'d expect - the direct translation of the Battleship you grew up with to the PC screen. Fire missiles into enemy waters and hope you hit your opponent\'s aircraft carrier; little gridded squares turn white when you miss and red when you hit. And when you hit, you\'re treated to a cutscene with a dramatic explosion of your weapon of destruction hitting the enemy ship.  <P> However, the Classic game springs a serious leak: no strategy. Not an intensely complicated game with intricate strategic developments to begin with, it\'s now just a guess-fest. The reason for this? You can\'t turn your boats lengthwise. Try as you might, you just can\'t. Sure, you can move your boat from one end of the grid to the other, but only horizontally. Try to flip it around vertically and you\'ll find yourself frustrated. And if that wasn\'t bad enough, those dramatic cutscenes also show you which of your opponent\'s boats you just hit. So when you fire your first missile and see it hit the aircraft carrier squarely in the middle, you know you have to hit it exactly four more times to make it sink. Same thing holds true for the submarine, the battleship, and the rest. <P> The Classic game, though, serves as training for the meat of this modern Battleship - which is a simple real-time war game. You construct fleets and send them out to accomplish a particular goal, and you must stop your opponent from doing the same. It works pretty much like the Classic game (aim and fire) but it\'s in real-time (meaning you don\'t take turns). There are several variations on this theme, but it\'s all pretty much a super-vamped version of the classic board game.  <P> One thing that is noticeably lacking is a detailed and complete manual. Granted, serious wargamers will be able to catch on to the premise pretty quickly, but lots of the folks who buy this game are old-school, plastic playing board game folks, and a little extra help couldn\'t hurt. <P> Hasbro Interactive\'s Battleship HITS with depth and strategy (and a cool opening sequence), but MISSES on the classic level. <i>--Moira Muldoon</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

On the surface, it looks just like the side-scrolling platform games of the 16-bit era. You\'ll find the requisite jumps, attacks, tricks of timing, and monsters (evil pigs, no less!).  <P>But Tomba adds to this tried-and-true formula. There are numerous ""events"" Tomba must complete in order to advance through the game. For instance, near the beginning of the game, you learn that you must clear some fog in order to move forward. It\'s up to you to find out how to complete this task; it takes a bit of exploration to figure this puzzle out. Once you\'ve gotten rid of the fog, you have ""cleared"" an event, and you can move on. Not all events are so straightforward; some tasks are downright cryptic, and you can have several events to clear at any one time, so playing Tomba requires some concentration.  <P>Tomba sports fresh, very cheerful graphics, decent sound and music appropriate for a platform game, and smooth controls. There\'s a lot of moves to master, but signposts along the way teach you how to use your controller as you progress through the game. Some areas of the game allow you to explore the foreground and the background of the level as separate areas, but don\'t let that fool you: Tomba is at heart a 2D game. <P>The only real drawback to playing Tomba is the limited ability to save your progress. In order to save a game, you must find one of the special signposts scattered throughout the levels; it\'s a chore to save your game when you want to. A much more logical option would have allowed you to save your progress whenever you cleared an event. <P>But that\'s just a minor complaint.

Disc may have minor scratches but nothing that affects gameplay. All ClassicGameStore games are fully tested before being placed into inventory.', ""In the world of video games, there are three great truths: Eating food you find on the ground makes you healthier, criminal masterminds leave plenty of loaded weapons lying around, and games based on movies suck. Small Soldiers is no exception. <P>Loosely based on last summer's equally disappointing movie, Electronic Arts' Small Soldiers casts you in the role of Archer, a peace-loving creature who must defend his homeworld of Gorgon from Chip Hazard and his band of GI Joes from hell, better known as the Commandos. As you journey through the game's 15+ levels, you'll find ten deadly weapons, controllable war machines, and a few friendly faces from the film, who can be called upon for assistance. There's also a two-player mode that lets you and a friend slug it out mano a mano. <P>Just as side-scrolling platform games were during the 8- and 16-bit eras, the 3D action-adventure has become the genre of choice for quickie movie adaptations in the age of 32 bits. More often than not, this one-size-fits-all approach leads to disaster (Acclaim's Batman and Robin). Such is the case with Small Soldiers. Since the movie is about a legion of toys that ransack a quiet suburb, why not create a comical, kid-friendly real-time strategy game? Instead, developer DreamWorks Interactive delivers a lackluster 3D action/shooter with sloppy control, mindless puzzles (green key opens green door, red key opens red door...), and unimaginative level design. Toss in subpar artificial intelligence and an extremely shallow depth of view, and not even an orchestral soundtrack and the voice talents of Tommy Lee Jones are enough to keep this soldier from going AWOL. --Gary Mollohan <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Jersey Devil,,['Disc plus hard plastic protective replacement case only. Disc condition ranges from flawless to scratched but is guaranteed to work.'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""The sinister Dr. Knarf has plans for world domination. And he's created an army of nasty mutant vegetables to carry out his doomsday plot. That is until he encounters the fiendish charms of Jersey Devil.... hmmm - if he only knew what he was getting into!"", 'Every so often a title comes along that, for whatever reason, you really want to like. A game that you think could\'ve been something special. But there are things that keep it from being just that. Little nagging things, big itches that just refuse to be scratched. Eventually the title that held such promise leaves you feeling exasperated, not because it was so far from its goal, but because it was so close. Jersey Devil is one of those games. In Jersey Devil you\'re waging war against Dr. Knarf and his legion of mutant vegetables as they attempt to take over Jersey City. It\'s your job, naturally, to put a stop to the Doctor\'s plans and return the city to its former glory. <P>Originally previewed at 1997\'s E3, Jersey Devil was a game that held a great deal of potential for the action-platforming genre. The main character looks something like a rabbit in a Batman suit, with a little Green Hornet thrown in for good measure. He wears a purple mask and suit, complete with double-breasted jacket, cravat, and elbow-high black gloves. The Jersey Devil is not only stylin\', but is less contrived a mascot than Sony\'s main man Crash Bandicoot. In fact, there was a sufficient buzz surrounding the character to prompt a small-scale bidding war over the publishing rights to Jersey Devil. Eventually Sony itself picked up the contract and delayed the release so that it wouldn\'t compete with Crash 2. Not that it would have mattered, because in the end, while certainly a substantial effort, Jersey Devil pales in direct contrast to Crash\'s superior graphics and playability. While it seems almost unfair to continually refer to the mighty marsupial\'s track record for comparison, the similarities between the two games practically necessitate it. Here\'s why. <P>Over the course of six large levels you must collect five tokens that spell out the letters K-N-A-R-F. These letters are strewn about the levels, sometimes requiring you to perform certain objectives in order to reach letters seemingly out of range. Once collected, you receive a golden ""K"" that lets you access secret areas. Along the way you\'re also required to smash green nitro boxes, illogically marked ""K,"" in order to increase your nitro power. Fortunately for you, Jersey Devil is a scrappy kind of guy. Practically an amalgamation of console mascots everywhere, JD can punch (Mario 64), do a tail-spin (Crash), jump (everyone), duck (Yoshi), and glide (umm...). Surprisingly, there is no butt-bounce. As is a staple of platform games everywhere, there are lots of boxes lying around just waiting to be smashed open. Inside these boxes are pumpkins; if you collect 100 pumpkins you get an extra (surprise!) Jersey Devil. Also scattered around the game are Devil\'s tails that award you with an extra try should you happen to find one. <P>During the game, JD is required to perform all sorts of feats, such as climbing up flagpoles, pushing boxes, throwing switches, and swinging from ropes. While you\'re attempting to do your chores, there are dozens of Knarf\'s minions attempting to put a dent in your day. Maniacal mutated pumpkins chase you around throwing bombs in your direction. Irradiated carrots, ill-tempered cavemen, and bad-mannered pterodactyls, among others, populate the stages with the single intent of putting you out of business. Additionally, each of the six huge levels has three subsections that must be completed, with bosses to meet along the way. While some of the bosses are nothing more than a nuisance, others can be extremely difficult, with unpredictable patterns and a fairly crafty AI. <P>This wouldn\'t be so bad if the controls were up to snuff, but they\'re not. This makes performing even the most rudimentary tasks a tiresome exercise in frustration. Digital control is way too touchy to navigate some of the precarious environments you\'ll find yourself in, while analog control (think Gex: Enter the Gecko) is often too loose for those very same situations. Granted, analog has a much better feel, especially when coupled with dual-shock vibrations, but it still doesn\'t help too much considering the collision-detection is just plain bad. Enemies will come from all over, and you\'d be lucky to land a solid punch while they have no problems landing theirs. Timing the spinning tail-whip is no easy feat either, since you must first jump in order to execute it. Maybe the developers did it to differentiate it from Crash. <P>Another problem that seems to plague just about every 3D platformer is the camera. While the camera is, for the most part, adjusted by the gamer, it can only be done on a horizontal axis. You cannot look up or down, and the problem with this is that the fixed perspective is situated at a slightly overhead angle, which limits how far ahead you can see. It also makes it difficult to see any items that may be above ground level (and there are many). Also, whenever Jersey Devil gets too close to a wall, the camera moves to a complete overhead position, which, at the wrong times (like in a fight) makes for some severely disorienting moments. <P>Other problems include a complete disregard for Z-buffering. What this means is that things pop up from behind closed doors, solid objects disappear even if JD is standing behind them, walls pop out, etc. Even little things that shouldn\'t happen, happen. For example, there are fountains everywhere in Jersey City, if JD runs into the fountain it will shoot him up so that he can reach the objects usually ""hidden"" at the top of the stream. The interesting thing to watch is his shadow floating right along with him; even when he jumps the shadow floats right in the middle of the streamPolygon draw-in is apparent but not horrible. In fact the environments are fairly well designed, which serves to disguise some of that pop-up. Which leads us to Jersey Devil\'s strong points. <P>Jersey City and all of its dungeons, cityscapes, and palatial vistas are surprisingly well designed. It seems as if the designers were inspired by the old Tex Avery cartoons. It\'s actually a shame that the camera and control don\'t do the rest of the game justice, because otherwise it might have been an enjoyable platform experience. The environments really require you to do a fair amount of exploring, and, often, you will return to previously explored areas to find secret paths that weren\'t available before. The frame rate never drops from a respectable 25-30fps, which is fairly impressive considering the size of the environments. Most of the characters, JD included, are nicely animated and make you feel like you\'re watching some sick, twisted cartoon. Speaking of cartoons, the opening movie is a poorly animated introduction depicting the origin of the Jersey Devil. Once you\'ve seen it you\'ll never need to watch it again. The last thing worth mentioning is the music. While the sound effects are all perfectly suited to a Looney Tunes game of this kind, the music is almost too good for the game. It\'s a dramatic score that wouldn\'t be out of place in an Indiana Jones movie. It\'s so good it could almost pass for a John Barry soundtrack. Unfortunately, that isn\'t enough to save the game. <P>While Jersey Devil had all the right elements in place, it didn\'t have the proper tuning to make the whole thing work. What remains is a game with an irrefutable charm that at the same time is just plain exasperating to play. With a few minor adjustments, despite its derivative nature, Jersey Devil could have carved a respectable place for itself in the hearts of gamers everywhere. Instead, it\'s just a glimpse of what could have been. It\'s not as if the developers didn\'t have the time. Hopefully the Devil will be back, though, because for all the Bubsys and Blastos, this time we had a mascot worth latching on to. Too bad we didn\'t have the game. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

While some people may have a tough time conceptualizing how to get through an entire game without a weapon, those who\'ve played Oddysee know that you bank on your ability to communicate, rather than terminate. And the old ""shoot first; ask questions later"" doesn\'t get you anywhere in Exoddus either. In addition to the reappearance of the somewhat simple roster of commands you had in the first gam - Hello, Follow Me, Work, etc. - your duty is now more complicated, as the Mudokons (that\'s your race) get angry, crazy, blitzed on Soulstorm Brew (a wicked but addictive concoction of Mudokon tears and bones), and so forth, and you\'ve got to talk them down frequently and systematically with the use of a whole handful of new commands. Naturally, as a friendly fart can\'t always solve more advanced communications conundrums, the developers have now given you the ability to apologize, slap unruly Mudokons into submission, and lead the blind.\n\nAlong the same premise as the first game, the Mudokons you\'re trying to rescue in Exoddus are much more complex than the original assembly. Besides the occasional drunk, blind, or just generally resistant creature, they all emote like mood rings, showing red skin when angry and an off-color greenish yellow and pale tone when sick. You have to find healing rings from Shaman Mudokons and apologize and shoulder-pat to make angry ones happy again so they\'ll follow you to safety. And blind Mudokons have a tendency to walk into drills and off of ledges if you don\'t guide them properly with verbal cues. On a positive note, you can use their blindness to your benefit.', 'If you haven\'t played a lot of Oddworld Inhabitant\'s first game, Oddworld: Abe\'s Oddysee, the transition from the original title to the next game in the line, Oddworld: Abe\'s Exoddus, may at first appear subtler than it actually is. Yet even though the Exoddus gameplay is essentially more of the same, it\'s more of a good thing, and the modifications are excellent. <P>We\'ve gone through the whole ""Exoddus is not a sequel but rather an offshoot of the first game"" rigmarole about 50 times by now. So, just know that Abe, the absinthe-skinned main character known as a Mudokon in the first game, is back in this title and is still trying to foil the plans of The Man, or the Glukkons for the sake of Oddworld Inhabitant\'s well-spun fiction. <P>The storyline is layers deep, but perhaps the most noteworthy feature of the Oddworld games is the gamespeak function. While some people may have a tough time conceptualizing how to get through an entire game without a weapon, those who\'ve played Oddysee know that you bank on your ability to communicate, rather than terminate.

Besides the occasional drunk, blind, or just generally resistant creature, they all emote like mood rings, showing red skin when angry and an off-color greenish yellow and pale tone when sick. You have to find healing rings from Shaman Mudokons and apologize and shoulder-pat to make angry ones happy again so they\'ll follow you to safety. And blind Mudokons have a tendency to walk into drills and off of ledges if you don\'t guide them properly with verbal cues. On a positive note, you can use their blindness to your benefit. For example, if a blind Mudokon is on the level below you, notably the one with the lever you need to pull but can\'t get to, you can stand on the side of the screen you want the blind guy to walk toward, prompt him to follow you, and then tell him to ""work"" in order to turn the crank or pull the lever that allows you access to another level. Another excellent function is being able to guide more than one Mudokon at a time. In the first game, you had to rescue one Mudokon, then come back and get the other one. In Exoddus, you have an ""All o\' ya"" command that captures the attention of anyone present. At points, you\'ll have a gaggle trailing behind you - sneaking, running, or jumping into the bird teleporters.  <P>But perhaps even better than the hammed-up gamespeak is the fact that the developers fixed what could easily be called the number one problem with the first game: the inability to save the game wherever you wanted. Not only was Abe\'s Oddysee a tough game, you spent a lot of time redoing what you\'d done because of the need to learn the hard way. Many of the puzzles in the original required some testing before you made it through, and when you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the path each time you fail, it\'s hard to stay inspired to push forward. In Exoddus, you have an incredibly welcomed quick-save option that allows you to quickly save your progress, anywhere in the game as many times as you want. And when you\'re ready to quit playing, you simply save to the memory card instead of a quick save, and you\'re set. This introduces an interesting dilemma, as the quick save certainly makes Exoddus seem easier, in a sense, but the game itself is actually even more difficult than the first one - it\'s just that now you finally have hope. And just when you think hope\'s lost, something wonderful like an invisibility power-up appears when you free Mudokon spirits. <P>Graphically, Abe\'s Exoddus is the same 2D visual wonder, much like the original or, moreover, Interplay\'s Heart of Darkness. Yet the graphics seem much more brilliant, as there are more environments with greater diversity in design. And the cutscenes are not only gorgeous, they\'re entertaining and (can I say it?) funny. No, really. Besides that, the game is quite large, and the environments are expansive. You\'ll have to rescue the spirits of Mudokons past; battle the typical, yet enhanced cast of Sligs, Scrabs, and the excruciatingly annoying Fleeches (long live the quick save), among others; as well as roll through the mines in mine carts and such. And sound-wise, you really can\'t get much better without being downright distracting. The voices of all the characters are incredible, and the effects, from getting blown up by a mine to the echoey sound of falling to your death, really can\'t be beat.  <P>Abe\'s Exoddus also has a two-player mode. While the Exoddus mainstay is clearly the single-player game, the two-player co-op mode does have charm, as you and another player take turns working your way through. When you die, your partner picks up where you left off and so forth. A bit of advice? Pick a crummy partner, and you might have some fun with this. Otherwise, the waiting game just doesn\'t parallel the egocentric fun of keeping this title to yourself. In all, Abe\'s Exoddus is a great example of how a game can stay true to its conceptual pursuit while still improving upon the original, all while keeping its soul intact. If you loved the first one, you\'ll like this game more. If you didn\'t play the first one, you can start here. If you hated the first one, it\'s likely because of the lack of save points, so you should definitely consider giving this series another try. --Lauren Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

It closely mirrors the arcade version (titled Beastorizer) but also adds new features in the process, resulting in a game that is better than its arcade counterpart. <P>Bloody Roar may look like a pretty plain fighting game at first glance, but with one tap of the Beast button, all that changes. In addition to a life meter, there is also a beast meter that slowly fills as the fight progresses. Once it gets to a certain level, characters can transform into a faster, stronger animal. Alice turns into a killer rabbit, Greg turns into a giant gorilla, and Fox turns into, well, a fox. In their beast forms, the characters can use new moves, as well as execute the characters' other moves a little faster. Unique to the PlayStation version is the Beast Rave, a fourth button that when pressed, hops the player up, allowing him to attack with almost no break in between moves. The downside of the Rave mode is that using it drains your beast meter, forcing you to fight as a human. The game's combo system keeps the game moving at a very fast pace. Most combos can be achieved through button-mashing, but if you take the time to learn the game, you'll definitely pick up some nice tricks. Toss in the special moves you gain in Beast mode, and you've got an action-packed fighting system. <P>The graphics in Bloody Roar are every bit as good as the arcade version. The game runs fast and very smoothly. The game's moves are also very dynamic, resulting in a lot of oohs and aahs as a wolf bites a chunk out of his opponent's neck and blood spurts everywhere, splattering on the ground. The music is typical fighting game fare, but the sound effects are really great. <P>Bloody Roar is one of the more original and exciting fighting games to come along this year. While it probably won't compete with the likes of Tekken 3, it's still a solidly fun fighter with an original take on the genre. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

When you run over one of these plates, you get a severe speed boost that doesn't cost you any energy (after the second lap, you get boost power that you can use at any time, but it takes away some of your energy), enabling you to blast past some of your opponents. However, they too can use these plates."", ""That's not to say that you can't dispose of your opponents though. By using the Z-button or the right shoulder button you can either crash into your opponent making his energy meter drop, causing him to explode if his meter is low enough. Or, you can try to shove him off the track if there is no barrier keeping you in. A number of play modes are available, including practice, death race, time attack, and vs. battle. However, the majority of the racing will be done in the grand prix mode, where the cup levels await. Each cup increases in difficulty, naturally, but with each additional level conquered, more and more racers are made available to you, adding replay incentive. If you make it to the final secret cup, you'll uncover a random track generator that offers you a fresh challenge every time."", ""So what's the problem with F-Zero X? For starters, with up to 30 different racers onscreen at any given point, some sacrifices had to be made in order to keep the insane frame rate so high. Polygon counts on the vehicles are very low, giving them a particularly uninspiring look. The track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it. In its defense, the tracks are cleverly designed, especially the twisty corkscrew tracks that speed by at a blazing pace. One feature that's lacking is a first-person view. If speed was truly supposed to be on display here, a cockpit view would definitely have helped, but alas, there is none to be found. Control is pretty good, although the analog stick can be kind of touchy in places, leading to a few inadvertent fender benders. The sound effects are very good and actually add to the feeling of speed in the game. Unfortunately, the music can be pretty annoying in a cheesy synthesized-metal kind of way and doesn't really add much to the whole experience."", ""As a game, F-Zero X is certainly thorough in its execution; unfortunately, there just seems to be very little in the game to keep you coming back. Sure, Nintendo incorporated all those funky characters to give it... um... character, but the game erases all that good stuff with its overwhelming blandness. Yes, the game can be fun in multiplayer, being supersonic and all that, but the game just lacks those certain intangibles that make a good game great. Practically flawless from a technical standpoint, the biggest thing missing from F-Zero X is that it lacks a soul. It's yet another stunning update to the legendary Nintendo catalog, but it's games like this that make you wonder: Where's Metroid 64 or Donkey Kong 64? Back to the drawing board it seems. --James Mielke <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

King's Field,,['Disc plus hard plastic protective replacement case only. Disc condition ranges from flawless to scratched but is guaranteed to work.'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Imagine a universe where you can travel freely - being able to look up and down climb ancient ruins traverse across oceans jump off ridges and duel enemies - all in real time non-linear play. This visual world will not only astound you but will pull you right into its universe. You will embark on a journey to an island of evil-ridden dungeons villages and castles as you seek the Moonlight Sword which had been stolen by a cult of insidious worshippers of evil.', ""Your beloved friends have drowned. Your possessions lie forever buried in the briny deep. Your honor is trampled. Your home, the prosperous kingdom of Verdite, faces annihilation at the hands of a power-hungry warlock's advancing armies. Verdite's last line of defense is the legendary Moonlight Sword, a long lost weapon of immense magical capacity. You are Alexander, royal knight and lone survivor of a perilous sea voyage to the island of Melanat, resting place of the Moonlight Sword. Your objective is all too clear: find the blade and escape. <P>This difficult, lengthy, first-person role-playing adventure thrusts you into Alexander's soaking shoes. Behold the fully-realized, seamless 3-D world that is King's Field: cold ocean laps at your ankles while stars twinkle overhead and Melanat is everything in between. Prepare for a great deal of swashbuckling and dungeon crawling. Real-time combat demands cunning and dexterity: once Alexander unleashes a full-force attack, he must regroup and gather his strength for the next strike. The same is true of casting magic spells. As expected, heavier weapons and particularly powerful enchantments require longer periods of recovery. There is little friendly discourse in the game, and the rare conversations with the handful of Melanat's kind-hearted denizens consist of passively listening to their problems and advice, along with the occasional buying and selling of goods. <P>Fully polygonal graphics with minimal texture mapping make for King's Field's clean, unpretentious look, though an overzealous use of earth tones in the visuals proves dreary and unsettling. Since the game is based on a mid-1995 Japanese release, its graphics look dated by today's high standards. However, the unfaltering polygonal consistency of King's Field is mesmerizing after extended play. Indeed, few games are this visually absorbing. <P>The game's inconsistent frame rate hovers between average and slow depending upon screen activity, while a forgettable synthesized music score detracts from the game's visual punch - though the sound effects are lush and vividly believable (most notably the guttural howls of Melanat's fauna).  <P>King's Field is very challenging, and refuses to be completed in a day, or even a week or a month. This non-linear, immersive adventure role-playing game is filled with elegant scenery, memorable monsters, and many miles of frontier to explore. While King's Field may seem unpleasantly action-oriented to the traditional role-playing gamer, and the avid adventurer might find it sluggish, open-minded gamers should be more than pleased with King's Field's execution - if only because of the sheer size and grandeur of the setting.  --Greg Kasavin <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

The series creator, Chris Carter, wrote an original story for the game and shot original footage exclusive for the game with some of the show\'s cast, namely David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Mitch Pileggi, and a few other regulars, as well. For fans of the series, the story will seem quite typical of an X-Files episode. Players who aren\'t fans of the series will find the constant references to the series trivial and unnecessary. The game starts off with the typical X-Files opening, where it shows something mysterious happening and then leads into the show\'s standard introduction. The game then starts you out as agent Craig Willmore, who gets a case involving two missing FBI agents - who, of course, happen to be Dana Scully and Fox Mulder. From there, you hook up with assistant director Walter Skinner and visit various locations, like the last place the missing agents were seen, their hotel, and so on. Along the way, you find clues and information that lead you to other locations, with other clues, and other people to interact with. The interaction is limited to asking them various questions that you select from a topic window. While the characters certainly respond with appropriate answers, it\'s not really an interactive conversation, since, in most cases, you simply ask them about everything that\'s listed on the topic window. The same is true when searching environments for clues, you basically check everything you possibly can, take everything you can, and go everywhere the game lets you go.  The only skill, other than finding everything and asking all of the questions, that\'s involved while playing is during the game\'s ""action"" sequences. These sections mostly involve you placing crosshairs over FMV bad guys and shooting them before they shoot you. Very reminiscent in look and style to the old Sega CD classics, the shooting sequences involve a bad guy who steps out from behind a suspicious-looking pile of boxes. You shoot him, and then another bad guy steps out from behind a pole. You also shoot him. Other action sequences aren\'t as obvious - for some you must you use your head and your inventory at the appropriate time, like taking a picture of a fleeing car to get its license plate number. The game can be rather fun when you\'re playing through these action sequences, figuring out what to do next, and moving the story along. Unfortunately, it\'s horribly frustrating when you\'re not moving along briskly, mostly because you know exactly what you need to do but can\'t find a way to do it. The constant problem that X-Files suffers from is the way it hides objects. For instance, you\'ll be standing in a bedroom, looking at the bed. If you look to the right, you\'ll see the dresser. If you look to the left, you\'ll see the nightstand. If you spin around in a circle, all you can see are those three screens. But if you walk forward while looking at the bed and then turn around, you can see there is something on the dresser behind you. Why couldn\'t you see that when you turned around before? This happens throughout the game. Even with the game\'s sixth sense help icon turned on (which gives you visual clues about where you\'re supposed to go next), it\'s occasionally very frustrating.  One other major problem occurs toward the end. During most of the action sequences, you can put the crosshairs anywhere on the bad guy\'s body and shoot him. But there\'s one generic guard near the end of the game whom you must shoot - before he shoots you. We tried to accomplish this simple task ten times. We tried shooting the guard in the face, the legs, torso, everywhere. It just simply wouldn\'t work. Then, finally, we shot right at the center of the guard\'s chest, a place we all swore we had attempted to shoot several times before. This time, for whatever magical reason, he went down. It\'s this kind of random behavior that really cripples the game. Visually, the game looks very sharp. Half of the game is composed of FMV sequences that look surprisingly nice, and the other half of the game is Myst-style stills of the environments you are in. The camera angles and lighting give the game a striking resemblance to the series. The game also does a nice job of recreating the atmosphere of the series with ominous music and sound effects. The quality of the voices and music is also very good.   In the end, if you\'re a fan of the series, the game\'s worth renting. If you find that the game\'s storyline hooks you, and you don\'t mind the interface, keep it for a couple of extra days and beat it, since the game only takes about ten hours to complete. However, if you\'re not a fan of the series, you shouldn\'t even really bother.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Due to the team's fantastic success with defusing major terrorist incidents, the international community has come to depend on RAINBOW as the main force secretly protecting citizens worldwide. Thus, the story continues in Rogue Spear, with the team's initial missions being business as usual: a hostage situation at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an airplane hijacking. However, the team soon discovers that these crisis situations are actually related to the nefarious plots of not one, but two antagonists: the Russian Mafia and a Middle Eastern terrorist organization--groups who have, until now, been able to escape the jaws of international justice. Through a series of increasingly difficult missions, RAINBOW uncovers the terrorists' deadly master plan, just in the nick of time--to save the world again. Players have new weapons at their disposal as well as sniper specialists to properly take out deadly foes from afar, and with more than four hundred new motion capture moves, terrorists and hostages react even more realistically to you and your team. The frozen breaths of team members can be seen puffing from their mouths in snowy conditions while footprints are left behind. Guide your team with a joystick, add more terrorists with the mission editor, and send your friends a copy of your greatest attack with the cinematic replay feature. All of this and more will make Rogue Spear the greatest action/strategy game you've ever played. Just remember, if you fail, the game isn't over--the world is.""]","by

Cosmetic Condition:Good Condition Notes: - The box has some minor to moderate shelf-wear - The instruction booklet has several creases and folds as well as some whitening of the spine."", 'There was a moment when I first began playing Shadows of the Empire when I actually believed I was a living, breathing participant in the Star Wars universe. The game\'s glorious first level (in which you take the controls of a snowspeeder in a gallant attempt to destroy evil Imperial Walkers, droids, and other machines on the ice planet of Hoth), is a flawlessly executed piece of video gaming: clear mission objectives, silky smooth controls, outstanding graphics, fantastic sound effects, and a true sensation of flight. I stared at the screen in awe as I made my first approach toward an Imperial Walker. Laser fire screamed past my ship as I angled to connect a tow cable to a Walker and wrap it tightly around its legs. And then it happened: The lumbering monstrosity seized up, its legs buckled, and the beast crashed to the ground in a huge fireball. I felt like jumping out of my chair and shouting to the world: ""Yes! Yes! This is what video games should be! This is what I\'ve been waiting for!"" <P>Unfortunately, the remaining nine levels never even come close to matching the quality of the first. And perhaps it is the game\'s stunning first level that makes the rest of Shadows of the Empire such a letdown.  <P>On the Star Wars timeline, Shadows of the Empire takes place during and after the events of The Empire Strikes Back. You play the role of Dash Rendar, a mercenary for hire who decides to take up the cause of the Rebellion. In a storyline that is never particularly engaging (due in large part to the rendering of the plot with still-life pictures and lines of text oddly reminiscent of the 16-bit gaming era), Dash finds himself knee-deep in the search for the frozen Han Solo, and in the company of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. Dash\'s ultimate mission is to unseat the Dark Prince Xizor, who is determined to murder Luke. While playing Shadows of the Empire, you control Dash as he struggles through ten levels of play, which encompass piloting a snowspeeder, doing battle in the Outrider (a ship resembling the Millennium Falcon), cruising on a speederbike, and running on foot through several levels of Doom-style, first-person shooting. <P>On the surface, Shadows of the Empire looks like a sure winner. But the game simply doesn\'t deliver the goods. It is difficult to control Dash\'s movements. The Nintendo\'s analog controller, so well-suited to Mario 64, does not perform well for the many levels of first-person action. Because it\'s difficult to move in a straight line, you constantly have to worry about falling off ledges or small platforms. Combine this faulty movement feature with the game\'s aggravating save system (like other LucasArts games, save points are few and far between), and losing a life from walking off a cliff becomes especially frustrating. <P>The camera angles are also a nagging problem. Four fixed views are available, though none of them is fully satisfying. The first-person view offers the best gameplay, but it limits your field of view; the second-person behind view offers a better view, but Dash\'s body squarely blocks your line of sight; the view from above has limited utility; and the view from in front of Dash is a throwaway. Finally, beating the game\'s several bosses ranges from difficult to nearly impossible, thanks in large part to the game\'s auto-save system. Being forced to begin a level from the beginning when a boss brings you down can turn the game into a tiresome chore. <P>In all fairness, Shadows of the Empire certainly excels in some areas. The game\'s ambiance is often remarkable; at times you truly feel you are lurking in the bowels of the Empire\'s darkest corners. Confronting lifelike Stormtroopers is a treat. The graphics, while at times oddly sterile (monotone gray hallways and endless sand-colored canyons abound), are still generally convincing. Many of the sound effects, such as ships\' engines, laser fire, and explosions, are perfect. Moreover, the gameplay is varied - few games offer flying, driving, swimming, and first-person shooting all in one package. <P>If Shadows of the Empire had lived up to its first inspiring level, it would certainly have been in the running for game of the year. As it stands, the control, camera angles, and frustrating save feature keep it from reaching its full potential. Programming for the Nintendo 64 is reportedly a daunting challenge, and perfecting the use of a true 3-D environment and analog controller will certainly take some time. Hopefully, the next Star Wars title for the Nintendo 64 will come closer to what Shadows of the Empire aspires to be. --John Broady <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Command &amp; Conquer - PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['NO GAME - Case and manual only. Both in good shape but may have minor flaws', 'When Command & Conquer for the Saturn came out, people at our sister site, GameSpot, thought I shouldn\'t be allowed to review it. Why? Because being the ""console boy"" I am, they assumed I would give a two-dimensional PC strategy conversion a low rating for not measuring up to my ""3D polygonal ass-whooping standards."" Guess what? I played Command & Conquer all the way through and awarded it with the highest rating of any game on our site - it occupied every free hour I had (at work and home) for the better part of a month. Needless to say I was very enthusiastic about the PlayStation version rolling across my desk. For those who don\'t know, Command & Conquer is one of the best-selling PC games of all time. Taking place in the near future, players choose between two forces battling for world domination - the peacekeeping Global Defense Initiative (GDI) or the world terrorist organization, Brotherhood of Nod. As GDI, your typical mission involves establishing a base, increasing funds (by harvesting a dangerous mineral called Tiberium), and generating enough manpower (in the form of commandos, tanks, engineers, etc.) to accomplish your objective, whether that\'s destroying a key weapon, taking out enemy defense posts, or leveling enemy bases. Your skills are tested throughout each mission as you try to accomplish your objective while defending your base against attacks. What about playing as Nod? Well, chances are you\'re roughing up the civilians and making life tough for GDI forces while watching your back for the inevitable retaliation. Command & Conquer on the PlayStation looks really good. The graphics have more detail than you\'d expect from a strategy game, and the between-mission cinematics are quite entertaining (especially Nod\'s). If you\'re used to the PC version, the lower resolution and control changes might scare you off, but the interface here works well and is simple to use once you get used to it (all point-and-click with a pop-up control window). The soundtrack stands out as one of the best ever included in a video game, and from start to finish, the tunes are simply awesome - featuring techno-pop that pulses along with the game. Graphics and sound aside, what makes Command & Conquer fun is the challenge it delivers. Each mission is tough: Towards the end of the game it can take hours, if not days, to complete a single task. With fifteen GDI and thirteen NOD missions, C&C has plenty of long-term play value. On top of that, there are fifteen Covert Operations missions (from the PC add-on pack), and five new missions exclusive to the PlayStation. It\'s no wonder this game comes on two discs. If you haven\'t played any other version of C&C, all of this will be great, but if you\'ve checked out the PC or Saturn versions, prepare for a slight let-down. This game moves almost twice as fast as the Saturn version, and this is not necessarily a good thing. New players may thrive on the speed (no other strategy game goes as fast), but purists will be annoyed that even using the ""slow cursor"" option does nothing to slow the game down. Also sorely lacking is a two-player option that could have easily been accomplished with the PlayStation link cable (anyone who has played C&C two-player over a modem or network knows that this is the ultimate way to play this title). Overall Command & Conquer is a great strategy game and easily the best available on the PlayStation. If you\'re dying for intense strategy, you can\'t go wrong. C&C purists may want to wait until later this year, however, when Westwood releases Command & Conquer\'s sequel, Red Alert. <I>--Glenn Rubenstein </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Those familiar with King's Field will instantly feel at home in this second installment of the slow-moving, 3-D fantasy role-playing adventure. <P>Our story takes place fifteen years after the events of the first King's Field. Without warning, a terrible storm decimates the kingdom of Verdite, spiriting away the protective Moonlight Sword and the King's very soul in the process. Only Lyle, the son of the possessed King, has the ability to locate the source of the evil tempest and retrieve the Moonlight Sword and restore the kingdom. <P>The game's leisurely pace remains wholly intact, as do its fighting and role-playing elements. To progress through King's Field II, however, players must rely more on communication with friendly characters (vs. the hack-and-slash original). Unfortunately, the conversations remain entirely noninteractive and are presented through onscreen text, not speech. However, King's Field II makes up for this shortcoming with striking, ambient sound effects and a respectable music score. <P>Virtually every object in King's Field II is expertly rendered in three dimensions. The fully polygonal graphics move at a relatively slow frame rate, much like the first game, but improved texture mapping, more vibrant colors, and an eye-popping menagerie of wicked beasts make the overall visual presentation considerably more appealing. Combat proves to be considerably more challenging and enjoyable this time around. The enemies better cover their flanks and recoil only from Lyle's most powerful attacks, although their increased abilities are offset by the treasure trove of new weapons and awesome magic spells available to the player. <P>Ultimately, King's Field II does not surpass the original sufficiently enough in terms of aesthetics or gameplay to make it a truly remarkable offering. The graphics and soundtracks, though better than before, lack new style or direction. Certain problems with the previous title are also retained, like an inability to quickly center the view after looking up or down. Nonetheless, players hoping for more of the same in King's Field II won't be disappointed. <P>The first King's Field was an excellent game, and its like-minded sequel is even better. This is an exciting, non-linear journey filled to the brim with swords, sorcery, and secrets. It is also a captivating, challenging, and lengthy role-playing game, and fans of role-playing adventurers should take it for a spin. --Greg Kasavin <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

With a colossal arsenal of high-tech, all-new weapons and more Nukem attitude and humor than ever before, Duke Nukem: Time To Kill gives you more of what you crave. More hard-core action! More exploration! More shooter mayhem! More of the King of Carnage!', 'Play against all new alien hoards in multiple time zones, using weapons designed specifically for that time period, and using clothing and outfits for that time period.', 'Features:', '', ""3D Realms' trash-talking strongman Duke Nukem first appeared in side-scrolling platform games before switching to first-person shooters, making this current leap into the 3D adventure genre a not too huge or unheard of leap. Yes, this latest Duke title, Duke Nukem: Time to Kill, places our boy in a Tomb Raider-style world, where players control him from a behind-the-back perspective as he runs, jumps, climbs, and flips switches much the same as any old Lara Croft would."", ""In fact, the graphics and control of Time to Kill are so much like Tomb Raider that it's impossible to not think about when Atari sued Magnavox over KC Munchkin's similarity to Pac-Man. (Perhaps Duke's joking gibes at Lara will keep the creators protected under the auspices of parody. Or something.) That's not to say that there aren't any differences in the gameplay. In fact, there are two large improvements over the Tomb Raider-style camera alone. The first is the game's look function, which allows you to turn all the way around when stopping to view your surroundings, and its center sight also doubles for weapon crosshairs. Duke also turns translucent whenever he's in the way of anything you could possibly want to see. These two things all but eliminate the 3D camera problems found in this genre of games."", 'Another plus that Time to Kill holds over the Tomb Raider line is the area of gunplay. Lack of enemies to shoot has been a major complaint of that series, something which the complainers will have nothing to gripe about here. There are tons of familiar aliens to shoot, and nearly all the weapons from the earlier Duke Nukem games (from pipe bombs to the RPG and a few new ones thrown in for good measure) are here to wipe them out with. The rampant destruction and gore found here are a lot of fun and make for a good payoff.', ""Those who enjoyed the difficult running-jumping-climbing-grabbing puzzles of the Tomb Raider series may be a little disappointed with Time to Kill because compared with the tougher levels of those titles this game is a cakewalk. However, those who found those levels to be a pain in the head will be glad that the puzzles aren't nearly so mind-numbing but should still feel they could have been a bit harder. All in all, a better midpoint between too easy and too hard could've been met by Duke Nukem: Time to Kill. As it is, it's a bit on the simple side."", ""Because of the ease of the puzzles, rampant number of power-ups, weak sister bosses, and the fact that there just aren't that many levels, you can carve your way through the game pretty quickly. A two-player split-screen mode exists, apparently to add to the game's value, but since there are no computer-controlled Dukes to join in the fray, it ends up being little more than playing a video game version of tag, just like Midway's deathmatch mode in Quake for the Nintendo 64. In the end, it's a fun enough title that fans of both Tomb Raider and Duke Nukem will definitely enjoy, but they'll also walk away feeling like Duke could've handled a tougher, or at least longer, game. --Steven Garrett <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Thankfully, basketball hero Michael Jordan steps in to save the day. However, despite the use of much-loved Warner Bros. cartoon characters, Space Jam fails miserably in every category. <P>Space Jam takes the basic play mechanics of NBA Jam and combines them with some poorly executed cartoon-based sub-games. For the basketball action, players can choose between two teams, the Tunesquad or the Monstars, and select two modes of gameplay (two-on-two and three-on-three). The sub-games consist of searching for hidden items (in locker and trophy rooms), and a pathetic excuse for a space race with Speedy Gonzales. Successful completion of these sub-games can improve an on-court character's attributes: shooting, speed, and rebounding.  <P>At best, the graphics in Space Jam look 16-bit.

Rather than clone PaRappa's feel-good style and use button presses to play music, Bust A Groove has you pushing buttons to control one of several dancers in an all-out dance-off. <P>The gameplay is pretty basic. Two dancers attempt to outdance each other with a large variety of different moves. You pull off moves via a series of onscreen controller commands. The dances branch out into different patterns, and you must sometimes choose one of two possible dance paths. If you perform your moves on time and in sync with the beat, you'll do well. Miss a beat, and your dancer stutters, unable to perform his move. A meter at the bottom of the screen lets you know how both dancers are doing, and whoever has a higher meter at the end of a song wins. <P>The characters are, essentially, clean versions of the club kids you keep seeing pop up on various daytime talk shows. You've got girls in cat suits, a disco dancer, and a gun-toting lunatic named Strike. A few changes have been made in this domestic release. Strike, while he still manages to sneak two pistols past the doorman, must have had his flask confiscated at the door, 'cause he now packs a can of soda in the small of his back. Also, that pesky no-smoking law has kept Hiro's habit from appearing in the US version. <P>Graphically, Bust A Groove is great. The characters and backgrounds are varied and extremely colorful. But the real showstopper here is the motion capture. The dancers move extremely well, better than any motion-captured movement I can remember. The music in the game is also varied, ranging from house to disco and just about everything in between. A few songs may be a bit annoying, but they all provide an interesting take on a different musical style. <P>Bust A Groove won't draw nongamers in like PaRappa did, but it's still quite a bit of fun. The great music and graphics go a long way, and again, the motion capture is really terrific. If PaRappa left you wanting more games in that vein, Bust A Groove makes for a good follow-up. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Mega Man X4,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['A new army of Reploids known as the Repliforce is accused of crashing the Sky Lagoon. Now they are classified as Mavericks and are on the run. X and Zero must hunt them down while getting to the bottom of the crash. In Mega Man X4, 8 more evil robots are on the loose and only you can stop them. Each character is unique with strengths and weaknesses.', 'Some video games the masses can enjoy, and some video games cater to the hard-core fanatic of a specific genre. Flight sims are a good example, as are most golf games. What many don\'t realize, though, is that even a genre as innocuous as the simple platform shooter has a hard-core fan base - a league of players that can run faster, shoot longer, and generally destroy any side scroller in one sitting. These blister-thumbed few need something better, faster, harder. Mega Man X4 was created for them. <P>First, you must be a fan of the motif to even understand this game. By motif, I\'m talking about anime and all the Speed Racer-esque backgrounds, bizarre character names, and recycled sound effects that go along with it. In addition to the game\'s general aesthetics, all the cinematic scenes are 100 percent anime, right down to the shamefully bad voice acting. The first scene introduces you, by means of a frantic music video, to all the games major characters. From there, you are thrust into the action of the game\'s first two-stage level that serves as a teaser to the rest of the story. <P>Through much in-game exposition, we learn that General and Colonel (great names!), under instruction from the evil Sigma, have incited Repliforce, an army of reploids formerly allied with our heroes, the Maverick Hunters, to riot. Following Sigma\'s plans to destroy the human race that created them, they have demolished a Maverick Hunter base and promise to continue the destruction until their final weapon is complete, and the earth is vaporized, or something like that. It is, of course, up to Mega Man X and his faithful partner, Zero, to foil their plans and save the earth from destruction. <P>Inventive it is not, but this latest installment in the extensive Mega Man series does sport enhanced graphics, a new soundtrack, gigantic bosses, and one other notable enhancement - this is the first of the series that lets you play as X or Zero. Capcom is hyping this feature as providing ""two separate adventures."" While it does increase the game\'s replay value, it\'s decidedly not two separate adventures. The game follows one scenario with a few differences, such as sidekick and dialogue, depending on the character you choose - much like Sonic and Knuckles or Resident Evil. <P>The real difference between characters lies in how the game plays. Play as X, and the gameplay is very similar to the other Mega Man X games. You run around and shoot things, collecting armor from Dr. Light and new weapons from your fallen adversaries. If you choose Zero, the story doesn\'t change much, but you must alter the tactics used to fight attackers and overcome obstacles. Zero is armed with a Z-Saber instead of X\'s Arm Cannon making it necessary to fight up close. No armor is provided for Zero, and instead of looting his enemies for new weapons, Zero learns a new fighting tactic when he slays an opponent. This introduces an element of head-to-head-fighter gameplay into the mix and makes it necessary for you to learn button combos to pull off each move. Needless to say, playing as Zero increases the difficulty level a bit. <P>No matter which character is used, though, this is one tough game to beat. Challenging gameplay, as in all previous Mega Man titles, is the key here. Each level, with few exceptions, is designed to include little secrets and interesting terrain. Each new weapon or fighting move learned requires practice to master. The various baddies are quite illusive and hard to eliminate. The real challenge waits at the end of the level - another Mega Man trademark. Providing formidable bosses has always been Capcom\'s strong suit. The true side-scroller fan is separated from the rest. It is a real test of will to sit in front of a TV and blast away at the same massive robotic bad guy for hours straight. Some find it tedious to the point of delirium; others love the challenge. I found it tedious. I tend to enjoy a few more puzzles in the levels themselves and a tad less adversity at the end of them. Fortunately, MM X4 is executed just well enough to make the monotony bearable. <P>The control layout is intuitive, and the reaction time is unsurpassed. The soundtrack, while incredibly typical, is filled with the Japanese video-game synth-pop hooks we all hate to love, and the cutscene dialogue, though pitiful, is a definite improvement over Mega Man 8. The graphics, unlike previous Mega Man titles, take full advantage of the PlayStation\'s 16-bit color palette and alpha-channel transparency, lending the game a decidedly 32-bit look. The multiple-parallax backgrounds are flawlessly rendered and cause no discernable slowdown in the frame rate. A few more 3D effects would have been nice, but the decision to stick with a true 2D environment is bold, if somewhat outmoded. Aesthetically, Mega Man X4 is a sizeable improvement over its predecessors, but you must remember that it\'s only a side scroller. Seventy or 80 similar games are out there that are just as good. If you\'re looking for something new, look elsewhere. If you\'re one of those weirdo platformer fans, though, Mega Man X4 is what you crave. --Mark East <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Now you get both titles in one collection."", 'Considered by many to be the finest shooter series in existence, R-Types also has the dubious distinction of being one of the hardest family of shooters ever designed - a bold statement, considering the heavy competition back in the days of Salamander, Darius, Gradius, and so on. The thing that separates R-Types eternally from its brethren, is its sheer difficulty, which is not a result of the maddening amounts of gunfire cascading all around, but of your having to memorize exactly where every enemy, shot, and obstacle will appear. There aren\'t a lot of fireworks in the R-Type world. Just inconceivably difficult level designs.  <P>In ASCII\'s R-Types collection, you get two classic 16-bit shooters, R-Type and R-Type II. Kindly, both games let you enter as many ""coins"" as you want, for endless continues, which you\'ll surely need. Simply getting past the first level is a challenge, and anyone who can witness the end of either of these games can truly consider himself a hard-core gamer. Pixel for pixel, the games are faithful reproductions of the originals, with extra enhancements thrown in for good measure. As usual with the R-Type control setup, there\'s a rapid-fire button (presumably to save your thumbs) and a single-fire button, which can be held down longer to charge up a power shot. Lastly, there\'s something called the force button, which lets you summon or release your force ball once you\'ve attained it by destroying the appropriate enemy. The force ball is the great equalizer in R-Types, as it acts as both an independent satellite when released and a partial shield that absorbs enemy shots. Throughout the game are other power-ups that increase your speed, add missile-firing capabilities, power up your force ball, and equip you with shields. Good thing, because you\'ll need everything you can get. Should you get blown out of the sky (and you will), you won\'t continue as you would in other shooters. Instead, whenever you die, you must restart from the beginning of whatever section you were playing, making the challenge even harder than usual. This is the true definition of hard-core. For greater success, try playing with a friend. <P>As far as appearances go, this R-Type collection does no one any favors. It came from the old school and it looks old school. A nicely rendered CG intro aside, this is as basic as you get. Fortunately, there are some additions for the R-Type fan, such as a history chart, ship details, and schematics. There\'s even a polygonal gallery of all the ships in R-Types.  <P>The downside is that, aside from R-Type fans, the casual gamer might find this game too hard and with not enough reward. For the collector, this is simply OK. Sadly missing is the inclusion of the Super Nintendo classic, Super R-Type. Surely there was enough space on the CD, no? In any case, while thin on the options (Dual-Shock compatibility not withstanding), R-Types offers plenty of gaming time, considering the sheer difficulty. For gamers less enamored of the past, you\'ll definitely want to rent before you buy. Those very same gamers may want to skip the process entirely and wait, instead, for the upcoming R-Type Delta, to be published by ASCII later this year. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

The latter mode has you selecting one of 12 initially available vehicles, ranging from a 4x4 to an ATV, and competing against nine rivals on series of 15 courses. ""Championship"" offers an abbreviated version of each course on a choice of three difficulty levels, where you\'ll be able to perform stunts for a chance to improve your vehicle\'s top speed or color scheme. Cruis\'n World also features four-player racing via split-screen display and support for the Rumble Pak accessory. Finish the point-to-point courses within a target time to unlock up to 13 bonus vehicles.', ""Cruis'n World is an arcade translation and the sequel to one of the first N64 games to hit shelves, Cruis'n USA. As you might imagine, no longer are you confined to the continental US in your races. Now you take your car around the world, visiting exotic locales like China, Russia, Germany, and France. Some improvements have been made over the previous game, but it's the same game at heart. <P>The graphics have moved forward, resulting in a reasonably manageable amount of pop-up, even in the four-player split-screen mode. The music and sound are significantly better than the original (which probably still is the low-water mark for music on the N64), but most of the tracks still come across in an incredibly annoying way. <P>Cruis'n World has a few different modes. In the standard arcade mode, you can just pick one track and race, or you can cruise the world one track at a time. In championship mode, you race over just a few tracks, but you do multiple laps on each track. Beating this mode is the key to unlocking the game's additional cars. A practice mode allows you to take on the tracks all alone, with no traffic to stand in your way, but since the game's difficulty comes from the opposing racers and not the track on its own, this mode isn't terribly useful or interesting. Multiplayer allows up to four players to select cars and race the tracks against each other. <P>All in all, Cruis'n World isn't a bad game, but it certainly isn't very good, either. Most of the time spent with this game will be centered around driving in first place, only to have it robbed from you by the CPU-controlled cars at the very last second. There's no room for error in your driving if you want to win, and that's perhaps what makes this such an annoying game. Rent this one, but it really isn't worth purchasing. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Einhander,,['Squresoft Shooter'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Brand new factory sealed', ""There's no denying that the space shooter isn't what it used to be. The once-thriving genre, championed by such classics as Gradius and Raiden, has boiled down to more of a nostalgic pastime. People just aren't as jazzed about blowing away hordes of alien space ships and racking up billions of points like before. While the occasional shooter still shows up every now and then, it seems like it'd take a miracle for a company to produce one that would rejuvenate the genre and renew public interest. Leave it to Squaresoft to accept the challenge. And while the fruit of its efforts may not be the miracle this genre needs for a complete revival, it's just about as good as shooters get. <P>Einhander isn't particularly long, but shooters almost never are. The half dozen or so stages are seamlessly interconnected and demand just over an hour to plow through in total. Each stage - in fact, each part of each stage - grows progressively more difficult, such that you'll constantly face new challenges in the form of smarter, meaner enemies and more of them. Likewise, the mid and end-level bosses will constantly keep you guessing, as they tend to be both unpredictable and versatile in their attack styles. Even shooter veterans will have their hands full with Einhander, though multiple difficulty settings make the game accessible and enjoyable even for those whose hand-eye coordination isn't what it used to be. <P>You star as an enigma who hails from the moon and swoops down upon Earth's powerful defenses, seeking to eliminate them single-handedly. You have a choice of three different superpowered spacecraft to fly, with two more hidden ships waiting to be discovered. Any of these handles beautifully, and you can adjust its velocity at a whim. All come standard with a typical peashooter that doesn't do much damage but gets the job done when you're dealing with lots of weak enemies. Some of the bigger flying vehicles and robots that'll come gunning for you will demand considerably more attention, but as reward for your effort, you can snatch their weapons from them as they convulse in explosive death throes. Over a dozen special weapons are available for your destructive whim. These include a vicious bullet-spewing Vulcan machine gun and its bigger, much nastier brother the Juno; the massive Cannon, capable of tearing through multiple opponents with a single slug; and the Wasp missile launcher that fires swarms of seeking rockets. Less typical weapons in the arsenal include the Blade, a short-range but powerful laser sword that can swirl around the hull of your ship to vaporize anything in your vicinity; and the Riot, a lightning gun that grows more powerful the longer you charge up its energy. <P>Each of these weapons can be swiveled between two positions, both having equivalent strategic importance. Further complicating the situation, these special weapons pack limited ammunition, meaning you need to make your shots count. Unfortunately, outside of all these great weapons, there are no power-ups or bonuses to be found anywhere. And you'll need all the help you can get out there, since one direct hit to your ship spells destruction and a trip back to the last continue point. <P>Finely tuned play mechanics aside, it must be said that a shooter doesn't add up to much if it doesn't look good. Ideally, you want to see as much detailed destruction crammed onto one screen as possible, without any irritating slowdown. Einhander delivers all that and more in full polygonal glory. The game flies by at a furious, consistently smooth frame rate, and everything onscreen down to the dinkiest enemy fighter is a carefully crafted polygon with moving parts, flickering lights, and plenty of style and attitude. Meanwhile, the background scenery is simply gorgeous. Countless levels of scrolling, complete with colored lighting and other impressive effects, make such settings as a futuristic downtown and a watery robotics facility really look alive. There's attention to detail all over the place, from undulating reflections in the water, to flickering neon signs advertising hi-tech nonsense. You'll fight any number of crafty enemy opponents along the way, and while the little guys explode in a blaze of glory, the bigger ones get shot apart piece by piece. But nothing compares to running into some of Einhander's boss robots for the first time. Your ship may look pretty slick, but it's nothing but a flea compared with the hulking, fully animated steel monstrosities you'll face at the middle and conclusion of each level in the game. These bad boys are as mean as they come and aim at you with blistering beam weapons, machine guns, and just about anything else you can think of. And should you defeat them, they really go out in style, with full-screen cataclysms, enough to make you avert your eyes. <P>Einhander sounds good, but not quite so striking as it looks. If anything, the musical score is a little subdued. Though the first stage opens with orchestral chords and an operatic soprano, all music thereafter is your typical rhythmic, ambient techno fare. It keeps the adrenaline going, but doesn't hold up too well in light of Einhander's graphics. Sound effects here are likewise in the typical shooter style, with high-pitched explosions piercing the soundtrack every inch of the way. Your ship's standard-issue gun sounds disappointingly '80s, though the special weapons you'll find along the way are appropriately deafening. Strangely (or perhaps predictably) enough, Einhander is also riddled with bits of German speech - usually shouted at you by the end-level bosses. <P>Though there are some hidden areas in the game, for the most part Einhander follows a set linear course. To help keep things fresh, you can look out for secret weapons and ships, and you can examine your performance once the dust has settled, with Einhander's keen player ranking system. The various difficulty settings and challenging bosses likewise lend Einhander much more play life than your typical shooter, and on top of all that, the game even sports a fascinating plot (fully revealed only in the last stages of the game). It's an excellent game that boasts all the assets that the best of its genre have to offer, as well as many of their inherent shortcomings. With that in mind, it probably won't make you a fan if you don't like this type of game in the first place. But rest assured, if you like shooters, you'll love Einhander. --Greg Kasavin <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Either the computerized version no longer plays anything like the original board game, or there\'s not enough difference to even warrant a computerized release. Fortunately, the sequel to the strategist\'s strategy game is something of an exception to the rule, as it not only stays faithful to the original gameplay, but it also presents some pleasant new spins on the classic Risk formula. <P> Risk II now comes in three different variations of Parker Brother\'s classic board game. There\'s the classic mode, which you play using the rulebook of the board game; the same-time mode, which eliminates individual player turns and instead determines the results of all players\' attacks simultaneously; and a tournament mode, which is a series of both classic and same-time games that awards points for completing certain objectives. <P> The same-time mode is essentially a brand-new game. While the mode uses only a slightly different map and set of rules, its differences and subtle nuances are enough to throw off even the most brilliant of Risk strategists. Instead of having individual player turns, same-time Risk is now split into phases. Each phase lets you set up your armies and attacks, then the conflict begins once everyone has submitted their battle orders. During this period of time, armies on the offensive that have yet to attack are considered en route to the country they will be invading and cannot defend their home country. Thus, attacking armies have to be considered carefully, as sending your whole army on an attack leaves your country vulnerable to an attack from a neighbor. In addition, multiple neighbors can now attack one country, giving an advantage to the player who owns the most of any country. <P> Same-time Risk doesn\'t use the classic six-sided dice; instead, it uses a completely new die rule - the attacker and defender each gets one 12-sided die that has a certain amount of number values on it, depending on the size of the army. There are five ranks of the 12-sided dice, called ""battle dice"", from white to black. The white die rolls an average of 2.6, while the black die rolls an average of 4.5, making it easier for larger armies to destroy smaller ones. Not only does the color of the battle dice determine how strong your roll will probably be, but it also determines how many armies you\'ll lose upon the outcome of the roll. While this new system is certainly interesting, it\'s somewhat one-sided, and it completely eliminates the infamous ""Rambo"" scenario in which your single defending army successfully repels an attack, even though it\'s hopelessly outnumbered. The advantage is now definitely with the attacker, as the defender no longer wins a tie in same-time Risk. To make up for this, same-time Risk sports a rule that limits exactly how many armies you can use to fortify certain territories. Unfortunately, this rule is frustrating, as you\'ll often find yourself with more reinforcements than you can spend on your border territories, making you waste those armies on a country that\'s not at immediate risk. With all these variables, same-time Risk is a quicker, more ruthless game than the classic version, and it couldn\'t possibly exist without the assistance of a computer to keep track of all the details. <BR>--<I>Ben Stahl</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc.

Unfortunately, Masters of Teras Kasi fails on many levels, resulting in a game that could have been incredible but instead is filled with disappointment. <P>The storyline is a bit thrown together, but that's acceptable considering that the Star Wars universe isn't exactly a perfect story for a fighting game.

The fighters' joints aren't smooth, and their movement is jerky. The stages look terrific, ranging from the swamps of Dagobah to the ice planet of Hoth. Some backgrounds feature a lot of movement, including flying snowspeeders and walking AT-ATs. The game's sound is very good, but that's no surprise, considering they used preexisting music and sound effects. <P>The game itself plays like it's stuck in slow motion. The characters don't move very well, the moves and combos are sluggish and uninteresting, and the force powers make the game very unbalanced. One of Luke's force powers is to throw his light saber at his opponent, which jacks the victim up for around half of his life bar. The move is also unblockable and unavoidable. So if you're fighting a fully charged Luke, you have to stay close at all times, or else you can just kiss half of your life goodbye.

Disc condition ranges from flawless to scratched but is guaranteed to work.']",{},"[""The perfect halfway mark between Sega's too simple Virtual On and Activision's too complex MechWarrior 2, Armored Core is a mech game that carries over arcade-style action while still retaining the ability to configure a vehicle that is at once your weapon and ride. Quite simply, it's worth getting and worth getting excited over. <P>You take on the role of a mercenary pilot of a large robot who can be hired out for missions varying from straight-out assaults and guarding convoys to bug extermination and classic one-on-one mech duels. These all take place within or above a number of terrains, such as underground installations, desert bases, downtown cityscapes, helicarriers up in the clouds, and space stations up even higher still. Nearly all are knee-deep in fun, and they culminate in a super hard final stage in which the developers at From Software really used their game designing skills for evil: You must pilot your mech to the top of a skyscraper-high complex via 3D floating cubes armed with guns mounted on both top and bottom - and that's just the tip of the iceberg. <P>Almost as charming as the gameplay are the upgradable options for the mech, which you'll be able to afford after successfully completing a few operations with the rig you start out with. These options include different functioning heads, cores (or chest units, thus the game's name), arms, legs, arm weapons, back weapons, radar, boosters, generators, chipsets, and more, all of which must be balanced out with armor class, weight, energy drain, and several other functions. A test stage is available to test out your mech after it has been assembled in the garage, to make sure that you're happy with the new setup. If you're not, the shop buys back used parts at full price. Different patterns and a custom palette are also available to paint your wagon with, allowing for everything from camo to plaid to your own personal shades of neon. <P>The game's basic controls are very intuitive, and even the advanced techniques are easy to grasp relatively quickly. As in Super Mario 64, you don't need to know every move early on, but the game gives you the chance to get them all down by the time they're absolutely necessary. Its graphics and soundtracks are fitting and workable. <P>All in all, Armored Core is a good, solid title that will eat up many hours of playtime for most gamers. Hopefully Armored Core Phantasma, From Software's Japanese release add-on to the game, will make its way out to the States in time for when they're through. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Monster Rancher,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""This is the first Monster Morphing game for the PlayStation. Breed raise and train your own personal fighting protege then enter him into the fight of his life. Use your own music CD's to create monsters!"", 'There are usually one or two games per year that defy classification. These original games sometimes break through and do very well, although more often than not, they fade into the background and slide into the category of ""sleeper hit."" Monster Rancher most definitely falls into this group of games. <P>The premise of Monster Rancher is simple. Picture that old Barcode Battler toy merged with a Tamagotchi, except instead of cutting out and saving barcodes to generate monsters, Monster Rancher reads a small segment of any CD and uses the data to generate a fighting monster. Some CDs will yield giant golems or dragons, while others will give you palsy little eye creatures and other not-so-impressive beasts. After creating a monster, you must train it to fight in the ring. You control every aspect of the monster\'s training from diet to what stats it will be striving to increase. Monsters can be frozen for later use, or even combined with other monsters to form hybrid beasts with multiple powers. The point of the game is to become the greatest monster breeder around, and there are rankings and other stats that will clue you in as to how well you\'re doing. <P>Most of Monster Rancher is menu-based, with the exception of the fights themselves. There are two different options for fighting, each with its own benefits. Beginning players will want to let the monster fight all by himself, with no input from the player. This makes the game more stat-based, with a liberal amount of luck sprinkled on. If you choose to control the monster, fighting can be very difficult, but it\'s also possible to win fights against higher-class monsters, if you get good at it. The control in the fights is a bit flaky and not quite what you\'d expect. The L1 and R1 buttons move your monster back and forth in the ring. The D-pad and buttons are used to select attacks from a menu in real time. <P>Graphically, Monster Rancher is pretty good. The monsters are very animated, showing pain, joy, and confusion. The sound is decent, but the looks and sounds of Monster Rancher are easily overshadowed by its superaddictive gameplay. If it sucks you in, you\'ll lose weeks of time. You\'ll actually feel a loss if (and when) your star monster passes on. You might start to relate better to your monster than to actual people. <P>Monster Rancher isn\'t for everyone. If you\'ve got a large collection of CDs, and the patience to sift through them, trying to find a worthy beast, then run out and buy MR right this second. If you like a little more action in your gaming, then you might want to skip Monster Rancher. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The only time the game pauses, thus giving the player control over how long the game lasts, is during boss battles. The player has a small degree of control, being allowed to move about the x and y-axis, but the overall direction of travel is uncontrollable.\n\nThe player has a full, 360-degree field of view, and can quickly look left, right, forward, and behind the dragon. Enemies will come from all directions and vary in size and health.\n\nThe player has two weapons, the hand gun held by the rider which can fired with a single button press, and the homing laser fired by the dragon which is controlled by holding down the fire button and highlighting enemies with the aiming reticle.\n\nThe game is set out over six levels and a final boss battle.

With new tracks, weapons, and ships, and improved graphics, Wipeout XL is one of the top second generation titles for the Playstation this quarter. Wipeout XL has six all-new tracks and two hidden bonus tracks. There are fifteen ships, seven more than the original game. Each ship\'s strengths and weaknesses appear right on screen: top speed, turning ability, shield level, energy level, thrust, and aerodynamics. Wipeout XL\'s turning has been fine tuned, making it much tighter, yielding superior control and ""road hugging."" The weapons in the original Wipeout slowed the opponent down but yielded little satisfaction. In the sequel, it is possible to completely eliminate a weak opponent from the race. The earthquake weapon is unspeakably awesome. The graphics in Wipeout XL show the benefits of a year\'s efforts. The tracks are more detailed, with parrots flying through the lush vegetation of the South American track and monorails cruising along beside the hovercars. The background visuals are elaborate to the point of distraction. The weapons are visually spectacular, and seeing the light trails behind the hovercars is just plain cool. The sound effects are an improvement over those in the original, offering sonic details of everything from the laying of mines, to the explosion of a direct missile hit. The music soundtrack features a mix of techno and ambient house tracks that perfectly matches the pace of the game. The artificial intelligence has been tweaked up a few notches and will aggressively attempt to eliminate players right from the start. Wipeout XL is linkable, providing head-to-head racing action for two Playstations. Wipeout fans, this is a must buy.

Box is in rough shape with heavy wear on edges and corners. cartridge and label is also in rough shape. box and cartridge have blockbuster labels on them. All games are tested before being placed into our inventory!', 'From mid-1996 through most of 1997, there was no other game that got me in more trouble than id Software\'s PC version of Quake. Whether I was losing sleep because of repeated late-night adventures among the game\'s single-player dungeons or wantonly deathmatching even when urgent deadlines were pending in the real world, I didn\'t care: The game was that good. Naturally, Quake\'s arrival on my favorite console platform was good news to me. But being such an adamant fan of the original, I was skeptical of another console version. <P>As I found, I had reason to be. First, the subtle control combinations allowed by the mouse and keyboard had to be reconciled with Nintendo\'s three-pronged analog controller. Luckily, configuring the Nintendo pad as one would with GoldenEye seemed to provide an acceptable level of control, though aiming up or down proved to be a bit tricky. Also the frame rate, while definitely smooth by N64 standards, is slightly slower on the draw than my Pentium at home.  <P>Fortunately, none of this sent my mind too far off track in my revisit to the classic levels originally authored by id\'s masterful design team. Each medieval room and hallway and each surprise monster or trap were engaging in the same way their PC predecessors were. Unforgettable moments such as a Fiend lunging out from darkness to attack or a Shambler lumbering down a corridor in hot pursuit or even an army of zombies appearing suddenly in a graveyard all had the same spine-chilling effect. It\'s just too bad that a few of my favorite levels, such as Hell\'s Atrium, were sadly omitted from this cartridge version.  <P>Once the single-player levels have been pillaged, most gamers will probably wind up popping their Quake cartridges in only if a deathmatch is at hand. The game offers two-player onscreen mano-a-mano battles in any of the original deathmatch levels, including a seventh brand-new level. While the level design here is far more interesting than any of the DM levels found in GoldenEye, the somewhat sketchy controls and frame rate proved to be more than a little distracting. Also, some of the levels are markedly underpopulated with only two players in the game. However, you just can\'t beat the convenience the Nintendo offers of being able to set up a quick grudge match the minute after the challenge has been posed. <P>Part of the allure of PC Quake was the exhaustive amount of ""mods"" (independent hacks such as new levels, weapons, themes, and automated players or ""bots"") that seemed to reinvent id\'s masterpiece weekly. If Quake 64 had followed the Duke Nukem 64 model and included bots to deathmatch against, gameplay and value scores would have been raised a notch. <P>Still, N64 owners are lucky that they don\'t have to mess around with any extra hardware to get close-to-3Dfx-quality acceleration in Quake. The Nintendo\'s processor is a descendant of Silicon Graphics, the company that developed the GL technology enabling incredible texturing in 3D games. Hence, Quake\'s masonry environments and gangly monsters seem right at home in N64 territory. This ready-packed near-GL-quality plus the quick and easy deathmatch setup are really the only advantages over the original game. If Quake is a game experience you don\'t want to miss, and if a Nintendo is all you have, then Quake 64 is your ticket. --Tim Soete <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

All of the solid level design,  inspired baddies, and engrossing gameplay elements of the Turok games are here, with new weapons,  power-ups, and incredibly smart bots (computer opponents). The only difference is this  game is a pure action free-for-all in which good aim and fast feet are the keys to  success."", ""<i>Rage Wars</i> offers a variety of opponent and map options. Play with up to four  other humans or a combination of humans and bots on more than 36 maps. Don't worry about  identifying the bots as the buggy opponents are running in place in a corner with guns  blazing at the floor--the computerized gunners of <I>Rage Wars</I> are perhaps smarter than the flesh- and-bones variety of opponent. The arsenal of weapons range from the familiar to the  entirely unique. Turok favorites include the crossbow, mag pistol, flare gun, and scorpion  launcher. In addition, a freeze gun chills enemies into blocks of party ice, an inflator gun  turns players into waddling weather balloons before popping (remember <I>Dig  Dug</I>?), and the Chestburster--well, let's just say that it lives up to its name. <i>--Eric  Twelker</i>"", ""Turok: Rage Wars is following in the footsteps of the current PC first-person shooting trend. Rather than have separate single-player and multiplayer games, the single-player mode in Turok: Rage Wars plays more like a training session for your multiplayer games. To be effective as a training scenario, the single-player missions need artificial intelligence that looks, acts, and plays as a human would. But unless the humans you play against are trying to play without looking at the screen, you'll notice that the AI-controlled bots in Turok: Rage Wars can't put up a fight, even on the game's most difficult setting. <P>The multiplayer mode will hold up to four players, be they human or computer-controlled. You can fight free-for-all battles, team battles, tag battles (where one player turns into a monkey and must change himself back at a switching station before he gets smoked by one of the other players), and capture the flag. Unlike most versions of capture the flag, this one features only one flag and one capture point. You'll pick a character (only a few are available at first - the rest must be unlocked in the trial mode), select which five weapons you want to carry, and then get dumped into one of the game's many arenas. There are a lot of different levels for each type of game. Most of them get the job done, but there are a few levels in there that are just plain bad. The single-player mode is meant mostly to facilitate the unlocking of secret skins and hidden characters. It puts you through all the game's modes on a variety of maps, challenging you to complete tasks like scoring ten kills before you have died ten times, capturing the flag five times, or tagging the monkey three times. <P>The game has a ton of weapons, each with a secondary firing mode, but only a few of the weapons are truly useful. Many of them, like the inflator, emaciator, and freeze gun, are neat ideas, but they don't really perform too well in actual use. Thankfully, you can configure each of your character's five weapon slots, so you won't be stuck with any weapons that you may find lame. Since you'll be choosing weapons before the match actually starts, there aren't any guns lying around the arenas. Instead, you'll be grabbing ammo, which respawns rather quickly. This causes a bit of a camping problem in some levels, since you can just sit near the explosive rounds and shoot rockets at anyone who comes near you. You'll also score some limited-use weapons, like bear claw traps, turrets, and mines. Finally, there are power-ups that deliver random effects, like invulnerability, invisibility, vampire, speed burst, and many, many more. <P>Speaking of the speed burst, that's what this entire game needs. The combatants just move way too slowly, yet they turn fast enough to keep any running character in their sights. So dodging shots isn't as useful as it could be, and the result is four characters, standing around, shooting at each other until someone dies. Tossing bots into the mix doesn't really help things. Even on the most difficult setting, the bot AI can't stand up to any steady-handed human player. The bots will do all sorts of dumb things, like run right past you without firing, wander past ammo and power-ups without picking them up, and, in team games, run into one of its AI-controlled teammates while walking through a door and getting stuck on each other until you get them loose with a shot or two. <P>Rage Wars supports the 4MB expansion pak, which enables a hi-res mode and a hi-res letterboxed mode. The standard lo-res mode looks mushy and really quite ugly, but it runs at a tolerable frame rate. The hi-res modes look pretty good, with crisp, clean textures and well-defined models, but the frame rate takes a nosedive, and this only adds to the overall sluggish feeling the game already has. Also, it should be noted that the game's sound is an extremely annoying composition of grunts, yelps, and explosions. If you didn't occasionally need to hear where things were coming from, you'd really want to just turn the sound all the way down and try to forget about it. <P>There is some fun to be had with Turok: Rage Wars. It has plenty of maps, lots of modes, and enough hidden stuff to keep you playing for quite some time, provided you can stay interested in the game for more than three days. But given the game's slow speed and the general lack of intelligent computer opponents, you're really better off sticking with another first-person shooter. GoldenEye 007 comes to mind, of course, as does Quake II. Both are still very good at putting together an enjoyable four-player experience, as well as providing a meaningful single-player mode. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.
