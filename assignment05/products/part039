Summoner,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['From the creators of the award-winning Descent and FreeSpace series comes <i>Summoner</i>, an original, graphically brilliant role-playing game. <i>Summoner</i> crafts a unique look and complex story in an intriguing fantasy setting. Summoners have toppled empires and challenged gods. They are venerated as saviors and feared as destroyers. With rings crafted by the ancient Khosani, the gifted can call forth demons, dragons, and elementals, but only the strongest can hope to control the forces they unleash.', ""The player takes the role of Joseph, who has yet to embrace or control his power as one of the last remaining Summoners. To save his kingdom from annihilation, Joseph and his reluctant companions must journey to the lost empire of Ikaemos, the island monastery of Iona, and the forest labyrinth of Liangshan. Their quest for the Summoner's rings is the only hope for salvation."", ""Summoning is an ability unique to Joseph. As you progress through the game, Joseph will find ancient rings that can harness his summoning ability. Each of these rings has a specific property (darkness, flame, light, etc.). When used by themselves, or in combinations, they have the power of summoning a creature to Joseph's side. In multiplayer mode, <i>Summoner</i> is a party-based hack-and-slash type of game. The players can travel from level to level, killing monsters and collecting items and experience. Along their journey, players will also complete short quests."", 'After they finished up <I>Descent: FreeSpace</I>, the game designers at Volition had one desire: to make an incredible roleplaying game. Well, <I>FreeSpace 2</I> was too tempting, and half of the team went off to work on the incredible space combat simulation, while the other half started working on some RPG ideas. Now, under the publishing banner of THQ, Volition has started to show early builds of the upcoming <I>Summoner</I>, and we have to say it elicits bucketfuls of drool.<P>The story centers on Joseph, a young man who had an unfortunate accident -- he wiped out his entire village. Granted, it wasn\'t really his fault -- the village was under attack, and he used some unique fledgling powers to summon a demon to combat the invading force. It worked, too -- except for the fact that after dispatching the last of the invaders, the demon turned and started bashing up the village and killing people left and right. Ostracized and haunted by his deed, Joseph heads out into a world filled with fun and adventure. <P>The engine looks fabulous. While many aspects of how it\'ll work are still up in the air, what we saw showed a 3rd person view of four-character party. The camera is movable, although Volition is still debating whether or not to keep the camera fixed at a high or low angle, or let it be free-form. The angle of the camera will affect how the artists create the artwork, however, so it\'ll likely be fixed, and more than likely that it\'ll be fixed at a isometric view very similar to <I>Baldur\'s Gate</I>.<P>The similarity to <I>Baldur\'s Gate</I> is an apt one, as the team has taken several ideas from the hit RPG of last year. One such quality is the instant-pause mode -- hitting the spacebar freezes the game and lets players input commands to their party. Hitting the spacebar again executes the given commands. It\'s a system that works well, and should be used in more games, as far as we\'re concerned.<P>Each of the characters is rendered in loving detail, and even light maps on different items and weapons look impressive. Capes flow and move when a character runs, including tassels and ponytails. Volition used the hardware available to them extensively, and might even add more cool effects as new hardware accelerators are released onto the market. The unoptimized engine ran smooth as silk as Joseph and company ran through the countryside and through cities.<P>The game will contain most of the usual roleplaying conventions, although characters and places have a decidedly feudal Japanese influence, as well as the typical fantasy-esque Middle Ages European feel. While Joseph, since he\'s the main character, can be just about any profession from sorcerer to fighter, other characters to join your party will have pre-determined professions. The game will have hand-to-hand fighting, magic spells, and bountiful mini-quests and sub-plots to pursue.<P>However, it\'s good to know that some of the normal conventions are modified and updated. For example, while hand-to-hand combat will work just like most games (pick a target, choose ""Attack,"" and watch the action), the modeling of the characters is so accurate that the designers can create choreographed battles, with thrusts, parries, and dodges for each character. As a test, they even examined the <I>Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace</I> trailer and re-created the fight scene between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon using the game\'s engine! They project that as characters grow more experienced in fighting, the moves will become more diverse, so players won\'t watch the same combat animations again and again. Plus, should the party encounter a low-level character, you\'ll actually be able to see a fighter decapitate the creature with a swing, while parries and thrusts will be traded between more equal opponents.<P>The spell system will follow suit with some amazing spell effects that make full use of the 3D environment. Currently, the team has about 40 spells planned, and their goal is to make sure that each one is actually useful. Rather than use the typical cop-out of creating several different versions of the same spell, they want to make sure that each one makes sense, and grows in power as the character raise their levels higher. <P>The real unique aspect of the game is Joseph, however. Because he is the Summoner, he can do just what his title implies -- Summon creatures. He\'ll be able to bring forth elementals, demons, and a variety of other entities. While they\'re not sure how many different creatures he can summon, Volition will make sure that it\'s plenty to keep players busy. The trick is that the summoned creature only sticks around for a certain period of time. Furthermore, Joseph can only control the creature for so long. If he\'s too weak to control a nasty demon, the rest of the party could fall to the same fate as his hometown. <P>With their incredible 3D engine and some marvelous innovations in how RPGs look and feel, Volition has a hit on their hands. We can\'t wait to see more of this game come Fall 2000, and we\'ll certainly keep you updated on any progress the game makes. Until then, however, we\'ll just have to keep drooling in anticipation. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>']","by

But the Freedom Guard must master a new species of semi-intelligent animals and battle a force of the Imperium's secret intelligence organization to succeed."", 'Whatever else may be said about Quake II, one thing is certain: It is the only first-person shooter to render the original Quake entirely obsolete. Within moments of starting the game, it is safe to say that all but the most irrationally loyal players will acknowledge that Quake II is better than the original in every respect, and that no one who can afford to upgrade will have any reason to ever load Quake again. Considering the countless hours invested by countless players in the game, that\'s a remarkable achievement. <P> It\'s also significant because since Quake shipped 18 months ago, we have seen a steady stream of challengers, games that have been trumpeted by press and players alike as the successors to the first-person throne. But none of these games has actually come through on that count - not Hexen II, not Jedi Knight, and certainly not any of the half-dozen ""Quake Killers"" that have yet to make it out of alphaland and onto store shelves. But Quake II does come through, delivering at least incremental and occasionally monumental improvements over its predecessor. <P> Many gamers describe playing Quake II in semireligious terms, and when immersed in the 3Dfx version of the game, it\'s easy to understand why. The visual effects are awesome, as in awe-inspiring. The masterful weaving of subtle graphic effects - colored hues that blend seamlessly into one another, intricate textures cast over complex and beautiful architectural features, and realistic transitions between light and shadow - creates a graphic environment that is without peer on the PC. Of course, Quake II supports many graphics modes and 3D cards (it utilizes OpenGL), and players will surely find a combination that works well on their system (even if it\'s a now-ancient Pentium 150). But none approaches the 3Dfx version, and it is the only way through which one can fully appreciate the technological achievement of the game. <P> There are gameplay achievements, as well. Most notable, of course, is the inclusion of a well-crafted, mission-driven single-player game. As players of its previous titles know, id has never been much for storylines, and while Quake II won\'t win any interactive fiction awards, it does make a credible effort to pull you into the game emotionally as well as viscerally. As you advance through Quake II\'s multisection levels, an increasingly ominous sense of purpose takes hold. And by the time the prison doors are opened and the factory is breached, it is difficult not to experience a certain tinge of horror, and perhaps even fear - both of which spur you on in a way altogether different from the deathmatch adrenaline rush that made the original Quake so famous. <P> Not to worry - the deathmatch rush is still there. And although the territory is now quite familiar to most players, Quake II offers a compelling multiplayer experience, due in large measure to a much-needed recasting of available weapons. No more does the player with the rocket launcher hold all the cards in deathmatch levels. Devastating alternatives now exist, especially in the form of a new electromagnetic rail gun and more versatile grenades, which may be picked up and thrown in addition to being used with a launcher. Realistic machine and chain guns also pack a powerful punch, with the latter capable of cutting an opponent to shreds within a second or two. The weapons have also been more acutely balanced, making more powerful weapons more difficult to use. For instance, the deadly rail gun takes nearly full second to power up and fire, and requires precise aim. The damage done by rockets has been lessened, and the rocket launcher takes a few moments to reload between shots. <P> The deathmatch experience also benefits from always interesting and occasionally ingenious level design. Not only are the levels tremendously varied in terms of architectural composition, style, and setting, they include boundless opportunities for ambush, sniping, and close-quarter encounters. The omission of a cooperative multiplayer mode is notable and puzzling (especially in light of the enhanced in-game communication capabilities). This issue will surely be addressed in the very near future, if not by id itself, then by any number of aspiring Quake II mod designers. <P> Other aspects of the game are more subtlety improved and fall short of being state-of-the-art. The sound effects, especially when set to the high-quality mode, are superb - so good, in fact, so as to render the rather monotonous musical soundtrack irrelevant (if not downright annoying) by comparison. But the sound effects of the original Quake were also first-class, and one might have hoped for the employment of more advanced technology, such as surround or even positional sound in the sequel. Enemy animations are much better (taking a clear cue from the N64 shooter Turok: Dinosaur Hunter), but in general the base character designs are somewhat nondescript and certainly not a match for those of rivals such as Hexen II. And while the enemy AI often delivers what id promised, and creates opponents that are more tenacious and more cunning than before, there is still something very mechanistic about their movements, almost like if one could look closely enough, the strings connecting them to some cosmic puppeteer might be seen glinting in the light. <P> But none of these are substantial criticisms. Given all of the strengths outlined above, one must conclude that Quake II is nothing less than a remarkable game, and we recommend it without hesitation. Compared with the original, everything in Quake II is better, nothing is worse. But still... there is a lingering sense - especially after spending dozens of hours with the game - that something is missing, that somehow things aren\'t quite right. What\'s missing, in fact what is altogether absent - the sense of true surprise, novelty, and even fun that once existed in the first-person shooter. Or to put it another way: Although it\'s never been done better, it\'s all been done before, and that casts a shadow on the experience that no amount of technology can hope to penetrate.<i>--Vince Broady</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

You play as Mouse, a poet and songwriter with a talking guitar named Pachimo. You've received an incitation to play an original song at the wedding of a princess on a distant island, and you have but five days to complete the tune. Once you arrive on the Island of Pandureu, you discover that the land has been placed under a time-loop spell that causes the same day to repeat over and over again. What's worse is that the hex has been cast by the princess' fianci, Zerphapolis. You try to defeat the evil Zerphapolis at the wedding, but you fail. Luckily, the time loop allows you to repeat the wedding day over and over again, making allies and collecting valuable items for the next time around. All of the battles take place in real time, giving the game a perfect balance of intriguing story, tough puzzles, and fast-paced action. With such original gameplay, EPHEMERAL FANTASIA is a one-of-a-kind."", ""Konami made a very strange decision when it chose to release this game  in the U.S. While the selection of role-playing games for the PS2 is currently  limited, Konami could have selected from a number of strong RPGs it has  published in Japan.

Instead you follow the  adventures of a bard named Mouse. Some of Mouse's occupation-related tasks  include composing songs and playing rhythm games similar to Konami's <i>Guitar  Freaks</i>. Most of the game has Mouse reliving the same day over and over  (think <i>Groundhog Day</i>).

LOTS OF FUN. GAMEBOY ADVANCE VERSION. BOMBERMAN TOURNAMENT. GAMEBOY ADVANCE VIDEO GAME. MADE BY ACTIVISION. GREAT COLLECTOR\'S ITEM. A MUST BUY. ALL-TIME CLASSIC. HOURS OF GREAT SUPER FUN. HIGH REPLAY VALUE. GREAT FOR ALL AGES. HERE IS SOME MINOR INFO ON THE GAME.There are three certainties in life: death, taxes, and Bomberman. Every major console and handheld since 1990 has been host to at least one, if not five, of Hudson\'s wildly addictive Bomberman games. The latest is Bomberman Tournament for the Game Boy Advance, released here in North America by Activision. Although longtime fans will bemoan the absence of costume choices and ""Louie"" partners in the game\'s multiplayer battle mode, the immensely satisfying premise of ""bomb or be bombed"" remains well intact.\n\nStraying from a recent trend in Bomberman games, the Game Boy Advance release of Bomberman Tournament contains a fully realized multiplayer battle mode in addition to its single-player quest. With the aid of a couple of link cables, you and up to three friends can duke it out in any of the game\'s eight multiplayer battle arenas--each of which has its own unique gameplay twist. Whether you\'re avoiding buried explosives in the land mine stage, hashing it out with full power in the hi-power stadium, or just keeping it simple in the standard arena, the variety of locations offers something for everyone. The game supports both multi- and single-cartridge multiplayer options, although the load times for single-cartridge hosting are somewhat excessive.\n\nThe joy of Bomberman lies in its simplicity. Stuck in an arena with three opponents, you need to lay time bombs in order to trap and obliterate the competition. The last person remaining is the winner. As you vanquish foes and clear away obstacles, a variety of power-up tiles appear. Randomly selected from a pool of 10 different items, these tiles can do all sorts of mischief.', 'In <I>Bomberman Tournament</I>, players take the original Bomberman on a rescue mission for Bomberman Max, who has fallen out of communication since being dispatched to the planet Phantarion to answer an SOS call. The popular Bomberman series comes to the Game Boy Advance system with 10 types of weapons and power-ups, eight four-player maps, and more than 200 room-based puzzles.']",Activision,"['>#65,228 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#694 in Video Games > More Systems > Game Boy Advance > Games']",$64.95,Video Games,B00005LOY9

While most of the titles Will Wright has worked on have garnered a respectable following, <i>The Sims</i> has appeal across seemingly all walks of life -- from casual, part-time game players to hardcore fanatics. Its broad appeal makes expansion packs a no-brainer, and the first expansion, <i>Livin' Large</i>, has done enormously well."", 'So what\'s going to make <i>House Party</i> just as successful as the first expansion? ""The idea behind this expansion was to make social interaction more accessible and easier to maintain,"" said Tim LeTourneau, Producer for the game. (We interviewed Tim just a few weeks ago. Read that interview <NO_LINKS=""http://www.dailyradar.com/features/game_feature_page_2399_1.html"" target=""_new"" title=""House Party Interview"">here</a> for even more House Party news.) ""It used to be that the only thing players could use to get Sims to interact in groups was the hot tub, and that just wasn\'t right.""', ""Interaction is everywhere in House Party, with all sorts of new ways to entertain large groups of guests at a time. Dance floors (complete with lighted tiles), giant cakes with dancers in them and campfires where Sims gather to sing and tell ghost stories are just a few of the new items. New NPCs include a caterer that makes sure the food doesn't run out and the plates don't pile up -- and there's even a mime that, much like many real-life mimes, is not appreciated. In fact, we saw him perform a short act for a Sim; the Sim booed him, and then the mime did a another short act, this time of committing <i>hara-kiri</i>. His well-being meters took a hit as well."", 'Not everything is here to help the player along, though. ""See that guy?"" said Tim, pointing to the screen. ""He\'s a party crasher. He\'ll show up when a party\'s going well, only to eat a ton of food and then clog the toilets."" Sounds like a few people we know. ""Speaking of toilets,"" he continued, ""players will need a lot of them. If you\'ve got 25 Sims at your house, you don\'t want a line that\'s 24 Sims long."" Additionally, the people that can jump out of the cakes are flirts. ""They will specifically target couples that are in love and hit on them. In one scenario, we opened up two cakes at once, one with a male and the other a female. Both targeted the same couple, which led to a major slapping fight and a big break-up.""', 'And that\'s one of the goals of this expansion pack. House Party, which will land on store shelves on March 28, is about getting a lot of Sims together and watching what happens, more so than about managing the life of one Sim. ""<i>House Party</i> is an entirely new piece to the Sims world. Where <i>Livin\' Large</i> added a certain sense of chaos and uncertainty, this expansion captures the social and more fun aspects of everyday life."" This expansion will work with or without the <i>Livin\' Large</i> expansion, and everything blends into the Sims universe seamlessly. Tim was particularly happy about the new kitchen table. ""Instead of needing a kitchen table the size of Connecticut, a single tile table will now seat four.""', ""Additional new items include a costume chest with over 500 new skins in it; a bubble blower that looks remarkably like a hookah; dance cages; vented windows; themes such as disco, western and luau; and a whole lot more. Luckily, fans of the series don't have too long to wait -- and judging by everything we saw and played today, the wait will be worth it. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>""]","by

The racer with the highest point total at the end of the tournament wins the event.

Players can span the ages from 1804 to beyond 2000 while establishing transportation empires and outmaneuvering robber barons. Scenarios allow for worldwide exploration and expansion. A sophisticated economy and stock market let players test their entrepreneurial prowess. <P> <I>Railroad Tycoon 2</I> is based upon PopTop's proprietary S3D engine, which allows for highly detailed 3-D graphics and renderings. The game was developed exclusively for 1024 x 768 resolution in either 16-bit or 8-bit color."", 'In an industry now thriving on ""me too"" games, it defies belief that there have been so few previous entries in the ""build and manage"" genre started by the original Railroad Tycoon. At least half of these have come from Maxis. <P> Railroad Tycoon II by PopTop Software puts you in charge of a vast railroad empire in the persona of one of the legendary tycoons or government figures of the day. The train and station limits from Railroad Tycoon are gone. You can build stations and buy trains to your heart\'s content without bumping into an artificial limit. To the best of my knowledge, no one has exceeded the train/station limit, if there is one, relieving one of the most frustrating features of the original Railroad Tycoon when playing on large maps.<P> The graphics are wonderful. At high levels of zoom the trains look photo-realistic. As time passes, the various cars (passenger, mail, coal, etc.) change their appearance to match the era. Stations have architectural styles to match the geographic area. Smoke belches from the engines, trails from homes, shoots out of steel mills. Visually, trains remain straight and level instead of following the track uphill or around a tight curve, which takes some getting used to, but watching a 4-8-8-4 Big Boy running at full steam is a glorious experience. <P> The sound effects are equally stunning. Each structure has its own sound set. Zoom in to hear the cattle lowing at a ranch; zoom out and the sounds blend together from different buildings giving each region a distinctive personality. Train crashes sound appropriately apocalyptic. Sell some stock and a chorus of voices echoes your actions. <P> The manual does an adequate job of explaining most of the details and concepts of the game, but there are annoying lapses. Gone are the train descriptions of Railroad Tycoon II\'s ancestor. Instead we get a bare list of trains according to their availability. On the other hand, a large foldout full-color cardboard playing aid shows all the cars, with full details on their weights in different periods, an industry flowchart with all the interrelationships depicted, and lists of buildings, station improvements, and hotkeys. <P> The train model has been simplified to some extent. There are no signal towers, though you can set the priority of a train (express, normal, slow, and stop) and tell it to go, wait until half full, or wait until full of cargo. You cannot drop off cargo at one station to be picked up by another train; one of the few steps back from Railroad Tycoon. <P> The business model is much more complex than Railroad Tycoon. When playing in expert mode you can buy on margin or sell short, giving you and the computer players all the tools to be all the ruthless robber baron you can be. <P> If business bores you, you can turn off some or all of the economic model. In addition to three canned difficulty levels, you can mix and match to create your own custom difficulty settings. Or chuck the whole thing, load a map, and play in ""sandbox"" mode where the only restriction is your imagination. <P> While Railroad Tycoon II is a real-time game, as was the original, you can pause the game at any time and continue to work in the game. This is especially recommended when manipulating stock; the computer players are ruthless and will gut you if given the chance. It is as easy to gain or lose a fortune in Railroad Tycoon II as it was in the golden age of robber barons. <P> Competing with other railroads is more indirect than in Railroad Tycoon. There are no rate wars. Instead, you can run trains on other railroads\' tracks and use their stations, and they can use yours. For this privilege you pay a hefty price that can exceed the actual return, if your stay on their lines is long enough. The computer players manage their rail lines adequately though not on par with a good human player. <P> The various displays for trains, cargo, stations, and your company make setting up and managing a railroad much easier than before. The map supports multiple levels of zoom, and you can toggle on and off different cargoes\' supply/demand, train grades, station displays (having these available on the map makes setting up new routes much easier), and other features that are legible at all zoom levels. <P> Real life also intrudes more than it used to. Wars, international borders, and economic events have to be dealt with and aren\'t the pro forma nuisance notices they were in Railroad Tycoon. To run trains through several countries requires obtaining the rights (read: mucho dinero). <P> There are more than 60 trains and 31 different cargoes as well as a dining car and caboose. There are three station sizes, and the station orientation can be hard-set to one of eight choices or left to the computer. Track layouts can be contorted to ridiculous extremes so that expanding an established rail network is no longer the headache it was in Railroad Tycoon. <P> There are complex cargo relationships. Iron and coal must both be taken to steel mills to get steel. Rubber goes to tire plants, but both steel and tires must be provided for automobile plants to produce their precious load. <P> Playing Railroad Tycoon II with all options on is an immersive experience. You can get lost in the details of stocks, bonds, and mergers or setting up routes and consists. Railroad Tycoon II never becomes a click fest. Sometimes considerable periods can pass without the need for intervention so you can watch your creation at work. <P> There are a few flaws. The most glaring is that there is no undo option when laying track. Laying track on large maps with lots of trains even when paused can be tricky. The program doesn\'t always keep up with your mouse movements, so saving before track work becomes a necessity. <P> There are also no long bridges or tunnels. They have been ""incorporated"" into the track-laying process without any visual representation. Instead, when laying track there is a certain self-leveling process that takes place to reduce grades. Some sort of additional grade reduction mechanism would be a good addition. On the upside, there is a greater appreciation for long-haul trains like the Mikado or the Big Boys. <P> Trains crash and breakdown more often than one might like, even when all maintenance options are used. If a crash occurs when you are short of funds there is no way to save the route for a later time when coffers are full nor to directly replace a named train that has crashed. However, Phil Steinmeyer, the developer, is an active participant in the comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.strategic newsgroup, and one patch has already been issued. So this point isn\'t moot yet. <P> PopTop has made the difficult look easy. It produced a sequel that eclipses the original in nearly all aspects. Playing Railroad Tycoon II is an emotional experience bringing back memories of Lionel trains and Christmas mornings long past and staring at Lionel catalogs and dreaming. No more arguments with Mom or your spouse over how much of the house has been taken over by your dream layout or how much money you\'ve wasted. With Railroad Tycoon II, all those dreams of childhood can be realized at last. <i>--Samuel Brown Baker</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

LucasArts Archive Series: Escape From Monkey Island - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<I>Escape from Monkey Island</I> continues in the hilarious tradition of its critically hailed and award-winning predecessors, <I>The Secret of Monkey Island</I>, <I>Monkey Island 2: Le Chuck's Revenge</I>, and <I>The Curse of Monkey Island</I>. Developed by the team who created LucasArts's irreverent classic <I>Sam and Max Hit the Road</I>, <I>Escape</I> features an original cinematic story full of drama, intrigue, and of course, sidesplitting humor. The game is highlighted by hundreds of challenging puzzles, set amidst dozens of rich and brilliantly rendered backgrounds."", ""The day fast approaches when Guybrush Threepwood, Elaine Marley-Threepwood, Stan of Stan's Previously Owned Vessels, and the other bizarre characters from the beloved, anachronistic <I>Monkey</I> series come back to PC shores."", ""In contrast to most LucasArts adventures, the Monkey Island games have always been really over the top. Whereas games like Full Throttle and Grim Fandango emphasized character and story, the Monkey Island games have increasingly leaned toward trying to make you laugh by means of an endless barrage of puns and pop-culture references. This is true of Escape from Monkey Island, the fourth game in the series. Much of it is funny, although a lot of it isn't. This inconsistency winds through the whole game, from the puzzles to the interface. When it's good, Escape from Monkey Island is very, very good. But the game's missteps do detract from the overall experience."", ""In this chapter of Guybrush Threepwood's adventures, the self-proclaimed mighty pirate and his new bride, Governor Elaine Marley, have returned from their honeymoon only to find that Elaine has been declared dead. This incorrect declaration has ended her lifetime term as governor, so she must now run against Charles L. Charles, a foppish glad-hander with a dark secret. What adds to the political intrigue is that the pirate hangouts in the Tri-Island area are being bought up and made into tourist-friendly venues like StarBuccaneer's and Planet Threepwood, thanks to an Australian land developer named Ozzie Mandrill. To top it all off, everyone seems to be looking for a voodoo artifact called the Ultimate Insult. These events aren't as unrelated as they may seem, and Guybrush must help Elaine stop the gentrification of his stomping grounds and find the Ultimate Insult before it falls into the wrong hands."", ""To reach these ends, Guybrush must once again explore the strange Caribbean Islands that surround his home, Melee Island. He'll visit Jambalaya Island (the island most affected by Mandrill's takeover) and Lucre Island and once again return to the titular Monkey Island itself. Many of the locales will be familiar to longtime fans of the series, as will a number of the characters. LeChuck, Murray the skull, Herman Toothrot, Otis, Carla, Meathook, and many, many others make guest appearances. In fact, there may even be too many cameos by old favorites."", ""There's an old joke. A guy walks into a bar and notices people keep yelling out numbers, and everyone in the bar busts up laughing. He asks the bartender what's going on. The bartender tells him that the regulars have told the same jokes for so long that now they just refer to them by number. Much of the humor in Escape from Monkey Island is like this. Many jokes allude to earlier events in the series, and they're only funny if you're familiar with the references. For instance, the fact that Otis the pirate likes flowers is a gag from the first game, and here it seems like the designers are simply pointing it out, hoping you'll remember how funny it was the first time around."", ""It's true that Escape from Monkey Island does have plenty of new gags and characters, and many of them are really funny. The talking figurehead on Guybrush's new ship is particularly amusing, as are characters like Pegnose Pete; Marco de Pollo, the world's greatest cliff diver; and Miss Rivers, the teacher at the pirate reformation academy. The humor is enhanced by the universally excellent voice work. But some of the new characters aren't quite as interesting. Ozzie Mandrill, the evil real estate developer, is only funny if you think simply being Australian is funny - although his particular way of talking does lend itself to a very surreal match of Insult Sword Fighting, one of the more humorous sequences in the game."", ""The bout with Ozzie is the only appearance of the preferred dueling technique in the Tri-Island area. This time, you'll learn Insult Arm Wrestling and Monkey Kombat, a variation on the Insult competition and a parody of the fighting game Mortal Kombat. The concept is funny, but unfortunately Monkey Kombat may be the single biggest problem with Escape from Monkey Island. You must learn to trade barbs in the monkey language, and it all builds up to a really funny parody of Mortal Kombat's famous opening. But the art of Monkey Kombat itself is a frustrating one."", 'Monkey Kombat is a more complicated version of rock-paper-scissors - it features five fighting stances, each of which beats two other stances. You must say three of the four monkey words (""eek,"" ""ooop,"" ""chee,"" ""ack"") in a certain order to change stances, and each transition is unique. So, Drunken Monkey to Anxious Ape (and vice versa) might be ""ack eek oop,"" while Charging Chimp to Anxious Ape might be ""eek chee ack."" These only ""might be"" the right combinations, because the combinations and hierarchy are randomized with each new game. The only way to learn the art is through trial and error and copious note taking, and it becomes tiresome quickly. However, Monkey Kombat plays a principal part in the entire last third of the game.', ""The biggest change in Escape from Monkey Island from previous installments is that it uses a modified version of the Grim Fandango engine and interface. Grim Fandango was the first LucasArts game to use fully 3D characters on 2D prerendered backgrounds. It also featured a fully integrated keyboard interface that was designed to keep you firmly rooted in the reality of the game. Like Grim Fandango, Escape from Monkey Island uses 3D characters and 2D backgrounds, and it's a testament to the great artistic design that the game manages both to evoke and to improve upon the surreal pirate world that made its predecessor, Curse of Monkey Island, such a beautiful-looking game. The characters themselves fare a bit worse in Escape from Monkey Island, if only because they seem less expressive in 3D, but they still look great."", ""The only problem with the use of the Grim Fandango engine is the interface. Escape from Monkey Island dispenses with the basic concept of Grim Fandango's simple, text-free interface and instead reverts to making you choose from a series of text options and sort your inventory using a more conventional menu. Cycling through the possible actions in any location is a bit cumbersome, and at times it seems like the game would have been much easier to control with a standard mouse interface - though the designers did add some funny bits that you'll discover when you're sorting through your inventory in front of other characters."", ""You'll be cycling through your inventory often. The puzzles in Escape from Monkey Island primarily involve using objects in your inventory in creative ways, and many of these puzzles are good. But there are a few that make no sense at all, even in the bizarre world of the game. Finding Pegnose Pete's hideout requires a leap of logic that is baffling, and even after you finally locate the hideout, the solution makes little sense. But just as LucasArts was the first adventure-game maker to ensure that players would never die in a game, the company seems to be taking an equally strong stance against players getting stuck. Clues abound throughout the game, and a full walk-through is even included in the box - a bonus that seems as cynical as it is helpful."", ""Escape from Monkey Island is a great game that can be frustrating. At times it'll seem as if there were simply too many designers working on it and everyone wanted their ideas included. The puzzles are hit and miss, and so are the jokes. This is best illustrated by the traditional LucasArts post-credits joke, in this case a string of pop-culture references that goes on and on, as if no one could decide which of them were funny so they just decided to leave them all. But in most cases, the game can be a real pleasure to play, because enough of the puzzles are good and enough of the jokes are amusing. As such, veterans of the Monkey Island series will surely enjoy the game in spite of its occasional problems. However, players who're new to the Monkey Island series may get the sense while playing the game that they're watching a bunch of old friends regale each other with old in-jokes; it's easy to feel as if you're being left out of the fun if you don't catch the references. So while new players should approach the game with caution, if you're a fan of the previous installments, then Escape from Monkey Island is highly recommended.<i>--Ron Dulin </i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc.

It pits you against cyberorganic creatures and nightmarish fiends as you blast your way through 24 levels.

The game features multiplayer support through the Game Boy Advance Game Link cable. Two to four players can test their mettle through all of the single-player levels and an additional eight dedicated multiplayer levels. Or two players can team up to blast their way through single-player levels in cooperative mode.', 'If you don\'t know what <I>Doom</I> is, you must be one of those weirdoes  who had something better to do with their time in the summer of 1993 than play  PC games. <I>Doom</I> is one of the most influential games of all time,  popularizing the whole first-person shoot-\'em-up genre, and is thus the  spiritual granddaddy of classics like  <I><a href=""/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=videogames&field- keywords=Quake&field-title=-pelican/${0}"">Quake</a></I>,  <I><a href=""/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=videogames&field- keywords=half%20life/${0}"">Half-Life</a></I>,  <I><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000DMAT/${0}"">GoldenEye 007</a></I>, and even  the more recent <I><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NZ1G/${0}"">Halo</a></I>.  Indeed, the major draw for this portable version of <I>Doom</I> is the cloying  wave of nostalgia it brings to hard-core gamers as they set about fighting the  hordes of hell with a shotgun and a chainsaw. This is an almost perfect  conversion of the original (or at least the original running on an average-speed  PC of the time) that even manages to include a four-player deathmatch and a  cooperative two-player mode.', ""The music is the same, the level design is the same, and, best of all, the  gameplay is the same (strafing works surprisingly well on the GBA's shoulder  buttons).

Settings and storylines are reminiscent of early James Bond films, with a healthy dose of Get Smart and Austin Powers thrown in for good measure. In designing the game world for No One Lives Forever, great effort was devoted to finding the proper balance of 1960s post-modern kitsch and full-on, gut wrenching action. Think of the easy charm and deadly influence of the beautiful Modesty Blaise. Consider the quick wit and quiet precision of the Avenger\'s Emma Peel. Confident, understated, highly dangerous, and loaded with sex appeal, these heroines were surely an inspiration for Cate Archer, ""the Operative"" in No One Lives Forever. As Cate Archer the player will need to make her way through diverse 3D environments, populated by wary guards and unique enemy bosses. As a top operative of the super-secret international anti-terrorist group UNITY, Cate has lots of weapons and gadgets at her disposal. She can gain access to at least 30 different weapons, many of which have four or five different settings or modes of fire. Cate\'s spy gadgets include a cigarette lighter that doubles as a welding torch, several shades of exploding lipstick, and even a robotic poodle. Hopefully this will be enough, as Cate will need all the help she can get as she investigates the latest catastrophe to hit UNITY. It seems that nearly half of the active UNITY operatives have been eliminated in just one short week and rival underground organization H.A.R.M. is bound to be involved somehow. This could mean a face-to-face confrontation with infamous H.A.R.M. operatives like Armstrong, the boxing Scotsman, or Inga, the neurotic tone-deaf opera diva. This could mean trouble for Cate Archer.', '<I>No One Lives Forever</I> is a story-driven, first-person adventure delivering over-the-top action, tense subterfuge, outrageous villains, and wry humor in the tradition of the great 1960s spy films and TV shows. Players assume the role of Agent Archer, an operative working for a covert anticrime organization. Armed with an assortment of conventional and experimental weaponry and gadgets, players explore exotic locales and contend with deadly agents as they evade traps, unravel mysteries, and become entangled in a cleverly constructed conspiracy that threatens the entire free world.']","by

More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How   did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an   onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console   systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of   games that consistently made the most of the hardware's   limitations, smart power management that extended battery life,   and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's   ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games   around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids   and adults alike."", ""Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling   it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back   in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around   the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program   instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is   more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen,   and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of   old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized   stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even   network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the   communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared   cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and   each unit had to have its own copy of the game."", ""What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game   Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is   backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful   games--including such launch titles as Super Mario Advance,   F-Zero: Maximum Velocity, Army Men Advance, High Heat Major   League Baseball 2002, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and Ready 2 Rumble   Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games   that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems   (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their   smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the   shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen.   We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition of Tony   Hawk's Pro Skater 2 and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to   see."", ""When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how   lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger   than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt   pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a   wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left   and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout   should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen   orientation makes it easy to see."", ""Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat   darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is   outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color,   the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to   play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your   neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection   of the light bulb in your screen.""]",Nintendo,"['>#35,535 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#32 in Video Games > More Systems > Game Boy Advance > Consoles']",$108.24,Video Games,B00005U8VD

The player must balance a good infrastructure, resources, diplomatic and trading skills, technological advancement, city and empire management, culture, and military power to succeed.""]","by

Though the premise--choosing a unique alien race and then leading it in a galactic quest for glory--isn't new, there is something about the series that draws people back. Is it the original take on the diplomatic, economic, military, and exploratory components of galactic conquest? Is it the intrigue of the Antarans, an ancient and predatory race that always seems to pop out of hyperspace to attack at just the wrong time? Is it the sense of accomplishment that comes from building a functioning interstellar empire? Frankly, I don't know. But for whatever reason, these games are notorious for creating a bad case of Just One More Turn syndrome."", '<I>Master of Orion 3</I>, then, has large shoes to fill. Appropriately, ""bigger"" is one of the best adjectives that can be used to describe this third installment. Fans of micromanagement are in for a treat, as the most noticeable new feature is the vast number of options available. The level of control is nice, but can be overwhelming--you\'ll sometimes find yourself swimming in a sea of menus, interconnected sliders, and check boxes. The array of empire management tools are all used to advance along one of three paths to victory: dominating your enemies militarily, getting elected as president of the Orion senate, or finding all five hidden artifacts.', ""Each planet in your empire has many components that must be managed individually--including taxes, build queues, regional zoning, terraforming, resource collection, economic infrastructure development, and military versus planetary spending limits. Successful management leads to a productive planet; mismanagement results in revolt and unrest. A vital addition to the game is an AI viceroy for each planet. Viceroys will carry out mundane work based on empire-wide policies you can set, but don't expect them to do exactly what you want very often. And even with the help of viceroys, the galactic scale is no less daunting. You must manage not only a galactic budget and research, but also diplomatic relations, spy infiltration, and military development and deployment. The manner in which the player interacts with the Orion senate is new to <I>MoO3</I>. You can now become a member of the senate and use it to impose sanctions or declare war on other alien races."", 'When diplomatic negotiations fail, space and ground combat become necessary. You assign task forces mission types that include long-range attack, short-range attack, point-defense, indirect fire, and reconnaissance. Ground forces are likewise grouped into task forces based on their size and strength. Once in combat, you can opt to control things directly or sit back and let the computer take care of everything. You can even skip combat altogether and jump right to the outcome--the fastest and easiest way to manage battles.', 'In the end, <I>Masters of Orion 3</I> succeeds with compelling gameplay that will leave you engrossed for hours (or days) at a time. Thanks to the strategic depth of the game, vast number of management options, diverse and interesting alien races, a randomly generated universe, and a sprawling technology tree, no two games will be alike. Though dense and complex, the payoff is well worth the effort. <I>MoO3</I> is a fantastic title perfect for anyone who enjoys strategy games. <I>--Jon ""Safety Monkey"" Grover</I>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Engaging and immersive gameplay <li>More depth, longer games, and greater diversity <li>Addictive--expect to dump eight hours into a single session <li>Multiplayer includes a turn-limits option and financial benefits for brief turns </ul>', '<b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Calling it ""graphically dated"" is being polite <li>Incredible complexity may leave a lot of gamers confused <li>Productivity, social life, family, and personal hygiene may suffer </ul>', '""Space is big. Really big."" So begins <I>The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy</I>. But like the void of space, there is a void in strategic space games. None have provided the bigness, that focus on the highest levels of grand strategy, that science-fiction epics in print, film, and television have long delivered. So, to the traditional 4-X strategy game of eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate, we have added an important new fifth X, eXperience. Through game devices that add character, story, and plot to familiar strategy play mechanics, <I>MOO3</I> delivers the grandeur and richness of an epic space opera--not in the guise of a traditional book, movie, or TV show, but in the medium of a game experience.', ""In <I>MOO3</I>, players assume the biggest role ever. No longer do players merely represent petty interplanetary dictators. In <I>MOO3</I>, players represent the controlling power behind an entire galactic civilization. The dictators, presidents, councils, and overlords that come and go are merely a player's pawns. One must use these governments and their leaders to secure the destiny of one's civilization and to manipulate its policies of freedom and oppression in both foreign and domestic arenas. It is not enough to be an able economist or a great captain to succeed in <I>Master of Orion 3</I>; considerable political, administrative, and espionage skills must be applied to craft your civilization's glorious chapter in the annals of time and space."", ""Although <I>MOO3</I> is a turn-based game and players can do anything, they can't do everything. Only a limited amount of Imperial Focus is available to each player each turn, so players must manage the ultimate resource--their own direct involvement! As players build empires, retaining able administrators becomes more important, as does watching their loyalty and ambition. Growing an empire means growing a bureaucracy and citizens can resort to voting with their feet or their pitchforks if they're not properly led."", ""It's up to players to provide direction and focus to drive their civilization to its goals. Left to its own devices, a civilization will slouch forward, but when properly led by a player, their destiny will be forever written in the stars.""]","by

The game includes 500-plus motion-captured moves modeled specifically for the high-impact, hard-core style of <i>RedCard Soccer 2003</i>. Stadiums and spectators capture the pageantry and fanatical nature of international soccer audiences (without the hooliganism!). Modes include single match and world championship. The game features multiple hidden characters, stadiums, attributes, and other secrets as you progress.', ""A football game in a truly arcade style, Midway's <i>RedCard 2003</i>  quickly abandons realism and accurate simulation in favor of exaggerated moves,  over-the-top tackles, and, at times, sheer violence. Fortunately, it's a  cocktail not without reward. Grounded in what is effectively a simple mixture of  pass, tackle, and shoot--all moves that are suitably intuitive and easy to get  to grips with--the basic game in itself is a quite enjoyable kickaround. The  difference, though, comes with the Boost button. By holding this as you tackle,  you can quite literally fly-kick your opponents off the ball. While shooting?  Get ready for a <i>Matrix</i>-style slow-motion buildup before launching an  explosive effort towards the goal. Suffice to say, there are plenty of little  moves to master, and you're going to have a lot of fun learning them."", 'Yet while this could easily turn out to be short-lived fun, Midway has injected  <i>RedCard</i> with a few extra goodies to ensure a longer play life. The World  Conquest mode, for instance, allows you to take control of a national side and  quite literally beat the best of the world, while cup tournaments and the simply  essential multiplayer mode further enhances the entertainment. Throw in extra  teams and other features to unlock and there\'s a fair challenge packed onto the  disc. So don\'t be fooled by the seemingly over-the-top approach. In the arcade  football genre, it easily beats Sega\'s tepid  <i><a href=""/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=videogames&amp;field- keywords=virtua%20striker/${0}"">Virtua Striker</a></i>, and it also gives more  mainstream titles a real run for their money.

Not only do competitors have to contend with one another, but they must also avoid crashing into the hundreds of cars scattered around each ""track.""

Each crash is also assigned a monetary value depicting the amount of damage that was caused to all vehicles involved in the accident. At the conclusion of each race, the most impressive crashes can be reviewed, with players controlling the camera, zoom, and motion blur functions.

Developed by the team who created LucasArts's irreverent classic <I>Sam and Max Hit the Road</I>, <I>Escape</I> features an original cinematic story full of drama, intrigue, and of course, sidesplitting humor. The game is highlighted by hundreds of challenging puzzles, set amidst dozens of rich and brilliantly rendered backgrounds."", ""The day fast approaches when Guybrush Threepwood, Elaine Marley-Threepwood, Stan of Stan's Previously Owned Vessels, and the other bizarre characters from the beloved, anachronistic <I>Monkey</I> series come back to PC shores."", ""In contrast to most LucasArts adventures, the Monkey Island games have always been really over the top. Whereas games like Full Throttle and Grim Fandango emphasized character and story, the Monkey Island games have increasingly leaned toward trying to make you laugh by means of an endless barrage of puns and pop-culture references. This is true of Escape from Monkey Island, the fourth game in the series. Much of it is funny, although a lot of it isn't. This inconsistency winds through the whole game, from the puzzles to the interface. When it's good, Escape from Monkey Island is very, very good. But the game's missteps do detract from the overall experience."", ""In this chapter of Guybrush Threepwood's adventures, the self-proclaimed mighty pirate and his new bride, Governor Elaine Marley, have returned from their honeymoon only to find that Elaine has been declared dead. This incorrect declaration has ended her lifetime term as governor, so she must now run against Charles L. Charles, a foppish glad-hander with a dark secret. What adds to the political intrigue is that the pirate hangouts in the Tri-Island area are being bought up and made into tourist-friendly venues like StarBuccaneer's and Planet Threepwood, thanks to an Australian land developer named Ozzie Mandrill. To top it all off, everyone seems to be looking for a voodoo artifact called the Ultimate Insult. These events aren't as unrelated as they may seem, and Guybrush must help Elaine stop the gentrification of his stomping grounds and find the Ultimate Insult before it falls into the wrong hands."", ""To reach these ends, Guybrush must once again explore the strange Caribbean Islands that surround his home, Melee Island. He'll visit Jambalaya Island (the island most affected by Mandrill's takeover) and Lucre Island and once again return to the titular Monkey Island itself. Many of the locales will be familiar to longtime fans of the series, as will a number of the characters. LeChuck, Murray the skull, Herman Toothrot, Otis, Carla, Meathook, and many, many others make guest appearances. In fact, there may even be too many cameos by old favorites."", ""There's an old joke. A guy walks into a bar and notices people keep yelling out numbers, and everyone in the bar busts up laughing. He asks the bartender what's going on. The bartender tells him that the regulars have told the same jokes for so long that now they just refer to them by number. Much of the humor in Escape from Monkey Island is like this. Many jokes allude to earlier events in the series, and they're only funny if you're familiar with the references. For instance, the fact that Otis the pirate likes flowers is a gag from the first game, and here it seems like the designers are simply pointing it out, hoping you'll remember how funny it was the first time around."", ""It's true that Escape from Monkey Island does have plenty of new gags and characters, and many of them are really funny. The talking figurehead on Guybrush's new ship is particularly amusing, as are characters like Pegnose Pete; Marco de Pollo, the world's greatest cliff diver; and Miss Rivers, the teacher at the pirate reformation academy. The humor is enhanced by the universally excellent voice work. But some of the new characters aren't quite as interesting. Ozzie Mandrill, the evil real estate developer, is only funny if you think simply being Australian is funny - although his particular way of talking does lend itself to a very surreal match of Insult Sword Fighting, one of the more humorous sequences in the game."", ""The bout with Ozzie is the only appearance of the preferred dueling technique in the Tri-Island area. This time, you'll learn Insult Arm Wrestling and Monkey Kombat, a variation on the Insult competition and a parody of the fighting game Mortal Kombat. The concept is funny, but unfortunately Monkey Kombat may be the single biggest problem with Escape from Monkey Island. You must learn to trade barbs in the monkey language, and it all builds up to a really funny parody of Mortal Kombat's famous opening. But the art of Monkey Kombat itself is a frustrating one."", 'Monkey Kombat is a more complicated version of rock-paper-scissors - it features five fighting stances, each of which beats two other stances. You must say three of the four monkey words (""eek,"" ""ooop,"" ""chee,"" ""ack"") in a certain order to change stances, and each transition is unique. So, Drunken Monkey to Anxious Ape (and vice versa) might be ""ack eek oop,"" while Charging Chimp to Anxious Ape might be ""eek chee ack."" These only ""might be"" the right combinations, because the combinations and hierarchy are randomized with each new game. The only way to learn the art is through trial and error and copious note taking, and it becomes tiresome quickly. However, Monkey Kombat plays a principal part in the entire last third of the game.', ""The biggest change in Escape from Monkey Island from previous installments is that it uses a modified version of the Grim Fandango engine and interface. Grim Fandango was the first LucasArts game to use fully 3D characters on 2D prerendered backgrounds. It also featured a fully integrated keyboard interface that was designed to keep you firmly rooted in the reality of the game. Like Grim Fandango, Escape from Monkey Island uses 3D characters and 2D backgrounds, and it's a testament to the great artistic design that the game manages both to evoke and to improve upon the surreal pirate world that made its predecessor, Curse of Monkey Island, such a beautiful-looking game. The characters themselves fare a bit worse in Escape from Monkey Island, if only because they seem less expressive in 3D, but they still look great."", ""The only problem with the use of the Grim Fandango engine is the interface. Escape from Monkey Island dispenses with the basic concept of Grim Fandango's simple, text-free interface and instead reverts to making you choose from a series of text options and sort your inventory using a more conventional menu. Cycling through the possible actions in any location is a bit cumbersome, and at times it seems like the game would have been much easier to control with a standard mouse interface - though the designers did add some funny bits that you'll discover when you're sorting through your inventory in front of other characters."", ""You'll be cycling through your inventory often. The puzzles in Escape from Monkey Island primarily involve using objects in your inventory in creative ways, and many of these puzzles are good. But there are a few that make no sense at all, even in the bizarre world of the game. Finding Pegnose Pete's hideout requires a leap of logic that is baffling, and even after you finally locate the hideout, the solution makes little sense. But just as LucasArts was the first adventure-game maker to ensure that players would never die in a game, the company seems to be taking an equally strong stance against players getting stuck. Clues abound throughout the game, and a full walk-through is even included in the box - a bonus that seems as cynical as it is helpful."", ""Escape from Monkey Island is a great game that can be frustrating. At times it'll seem as if there were simply too many designers working on it and everyone wanted their ideas included. The puzzles are hit and miss, and so are the jokes. This is best illustrated by the traditional LucasArts post-credits joke, in this case a string of pop-culture references that goes on and on, as if no one could decide which of them were funny so they just decided to leave them all. But in most cases, the game can be a real pleasure to play, because enough of the puzzles are good and enough of the jokes are amusing. As such, veterans of the Monkey Island series will surely enjoy the game in spite of its occasional problems. However, players who're new to the Monkey Island series may get the sense while playing the game that they're watching a bunch of old friends regale each other with old in-jokes; it's easy to feel as if you're being left out of the fun if you don't catch the references. So while new players should approach the game with caution, if you're a fan of the previous installments, then Escape from Monkey Island is highly recommended.<i>--Ron Dulin </i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc.

Their dreams were teased by a brief shot of an alien skull in the Predator's trophy room in <i>Predator 2</i>, indulged by several uneven pairings in comic books, and finally fulfilled in Rebellion's underrated <i>Aliens vs. Predator</i> video game. Fox Interactive, teamed this time with developer Monolith, delights these fans again with <i>Aliens vs. Predator 2</i>, and the result is easily one of the most intense 3-D shooters ever released."", 'Like in the first game, there are three distinct campaigns. One lets you play as the Predator, another as an Alien, and a third as the overconfident humans they prey upon. This time out the stories are much more detailed, even crossing over in interesting ways. The plot concerns some arrogant human scientists, a group of heroic marines, a rogue Predator, and the faceless Alien horde found on LV-1201 (the planet from the first two <i>Alien</i> films).', ""As a human, you play a fearless roughneck sent to check things out and perform missions. This generally involves rescuing fellow marines, recon work, restoring power to various systems, and trying to stay alive against fast-moving killing machines with acid for blood and nasty dispositions. You're armed with the incredible pulse rifle from the films, other weapons such as a knife and a smart gun (which automatically locks onto targets for you), a tension-inducing motion tracker, and a shoulder-mounted flashlight that casts eerie shadows. The Predator is armed with his shoulder cannon, cloaking device, spear, and his famous wrist claws."", ""The Alien campaign is the most interesting as it first casts you as the spiderlike face hugger. You've got to roam the corridors looking for a solitary victim. Once you implant a human, you play the small and snakelike chest-burster, seeking out rodents and other tiny prey so you can quickly molt and grow into a full-fledged alien. Then all hell breaks loose as the humans become your prey. You can claw, perform a head bite (which restores health), and execute a fearsome pounce attack that literally explodes the target. Aliens can also cling and climb on walls, which takes some getting used to, but the effect is exhilarating, as is the hunt."", 'The graphics are evocative of the films and feature strobe lights, flashing reds and whites, ample darkness, abandoned barricades, sputtering ruined equipment, and horrific scenes of carnage. The music rises and falls with the drama and draws heavily from the Alien films in particular. And the game is relentlessly creepy, whether or not you are the hunter or hunted. The audio is equally effective, from screaming humans to screeching alien attackers to the familiar Predator purring chuckle. The game is also filled with often amusing conversations between guards, marines, and scientists.', 'The three campaigns offer 21 missions, but the wide range of multiplayer game modes deserve special mention. The game has legs, no matter which species you prefer, and already a community has sprung up for challenges between gamers. Unfortunately, the Net code is a bit buggy: be sure to download the latest patch.', 'Monolith has created a much better game than the previous installment, mainly by pumping up the atmosphere, refining the controls, and making sure the three stories combine into a greater tale of horror and survival. Oh, and most importantly to some, the game lets you save whenever you want. Just remember this when playing the game--on the Internet, no one can hear you scream, but your neighbors can. <i>--Bob Andrews</i>', '<b>Pros:</b>', '']","by

Shogun Total War (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Japan, 1542--a country in turmoil. The last shogunate has collapsed, leaving a nation divided into numerous factions, each led by a daimyo (feudal warlord). Each daimyo is out to scheme, murder, and wage war to become supreme ruler. The emperor is powerless--a puppet of whichever faction controls Kyoto. Into this melting pot come the first European explorers, bringing guns, religion--and disease. Out of this chaos will emerge only one daimyo who will master all the varied skills that make up the art of war: politics, economics, subterfuge, strategic warfare, and battlefield tactics. Only one will become shogun.', ""Sunguko Jidai, The Age of the Country at War, the time in Japanese history when warlords dominated the entire culture, battling for control of the country so that they could be named Shogun. Perhaps only the Romans, Monguls and Spartans have created civilizations in which warfare was as dedicated a feature of life. Game designers have recreated this stretch of time repeatedly -- for a wargamer, this is a romantic time period. These are the machinations of 13-year-old boys' dreams: warlords, massive battles, ninja, shinobi, castle sieges, geisha assassins and the bushido code. Creative Assembly has tapped into that wellspring of imagination with the creation of <I>Shogun: Total War</I>, a combination 2D board game and 3D realtime strategy wargame. Despite some technical flaws and a difficult user interface, <I>Shogun</I> will please wargamers looking for a solid title.<I>Shogun</I> is mostly a 2D game; the decisions that cause conflict, build castles, assign ninja and betray alliances all take place in a two-dimensional game that mimics a board game. The pieces represent painted woodcarvings, even making a wood sound when placed on the map. During this board-game section of the game, players will control the financial, military and diplomatic aspects of the clans they choose to represent. It's turn-based board gaming here, with an easy-to-use interface, a nice-sized technology tree and good AI. Actually the AI comes in four flavors, easy to expert, and they really make a difference. On the easiest level it's possible for a good wargamer to unite Japan in under ten hours of play, but as the difficulty is increased even expert gamers will be challenged to keep their clans alive, let alone unite Japan.<P>Once a battle inevitably ensues, the player will get the option of controlling the battle in the 3D RTS part of the game or letting it resolve automatically. As it turns out, most players are going to need to control their battles until later in the game, because the automatic resolve seems to favor the computer until you reach the point of massively outnumbering the enemy. <P>The 3D RTS combat will pit your men against the enemy in various environments that range from foggy forests to flat plains divided by a river. The player will control units of soldiers as opposed to individuals; units get as large as 120 men per unit and battles can feature 16 units on the screen at the same time, which means 3,840 men fighting on the screen at one time. The 3D engine does a great job with the environment, though the men themselves are sprite-based. The camera is pulled quite a bit back and really gives an epic scale to combat. There is even a widescreen mode of play -- it's Akira Kurosawa's RAN come to life.<P>That is, if you can get it working. Beware GeForce owners; we had unplayable stability problems with the game on our PIII GeForce setup, but it was just fine with Voodoo and TNT setups. Annoyingly enough, you'd better get ready for a big footprint on your hard drive -- 1.4 gigs -- or be ready to do a lot of CD swapping. For some reason that defies explanation, the game requires disk 1 to start the game and disk 2 to begin a campaign if you don't have it fully installed. The real difficulty with the game, though, happens in the 3D realtime section of the game, specifically with the user interface. Controlling the camera and the men isn't intuitive; in fact, you'll fight the controls as much as the enemy in many cases. The tutorial, while decent as an introduction to this style of combat, isn't good enough to familiarize a player with the complexity of the interface. <P>After some coaxing, though, a veteran wargamer with some RTS skills should thoroughly enjoy the mixture of the two styles. With the levels of difficulty, seven different clans to choose from and historical battles ready to be fought, not to mention the multiplayer (3D combat only), there is a lot of replayability. This isn't for the mass market, though -- control issues and the difficulty of 3D realtime combat limit this game to genre-specific fans. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>""]","by

The story takes place in a fictional world, during an unspecified period following a war between a civilization and god-like beasts concerning the use of mana to fuel the ""Mana Fortress"", a flying warship. During this war, a hero used the power of the Mana Sword to destroy the fortress and appease the angered gods, returning peace to the world. Disobeying their Elder\'s instructions, three boys from the small Potos village trespass into a local waterfall where a treasure is said to be kept. One of the boys, the game\'s protagonist, stumbles and falls into the lake, where he finds a rusty sword embedded in a stone. Guided by a disembodied voice, he pulls the sword free, inadvertently unleashing monsters in the surrounding countryside of the village. The villagers interpret the sword\'s removal as a bad omen and banish the boy from Potos forever. An elderly knight named Jema recognizes the blade as the legendary Mana Sword, and encourages the hero to re-energize it by visiting the eight Mana Temples.']",SquareSoft,"['>#74,092 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)']",$72.26,Video Games,B000068HDC

The storyline of Strike Fighters is set during a fictional conflict between the Kingdom of Dhimar and the Empire of Paran. The story begins in 1919, when geologists discover oil in the Valley of Kerman, a place at the Dhimari-Parani border. When drilling operations begin in the oil fields, Shah Mushani of Paran sends his troops across the border, beginning a long conflict between the nations. In September 1933, Shah Mushani decides to put a halt to the conflict, following numerous attempts to capture the Mazadran oil fields. While Dhimar becomes a wealthy and economically powerful country, Paran has become poor. In February 1957, Halani Khomar, a Soviet-backed revolutionary leader, stages a bloody coup against the Mushani regime. Once in power, Khomar begins building up the Parani military forces, buying the newest fighter aircraft and tanks from the Soviet Union. King Husani Karmar al'Galbhi of Dhimar, fearing a new war, decides to approach the United States for military assistance. Tensions between the two countries culminate in two years of terrorist attacks in Dhimari border cities. In June 1959, the Dhimari ports become subject to a Parani naval blockade, stopping all shipping from and to Dhimar. Prince Fa'ad al'Galbhi, commander of the Dhimari Air Force, starts an emergency buildup of air power by creating several Special Operations Wings, manned by foreign mercenary pilots willing to fight. In July, the US dispatches US Naval and Air Force squadrons to assist their ally.""]","by

Total Annihilation: Kingdoms (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['In these epic quests, four immortal sibling monarchs are locked in a massive campaign to rule the land of Darien. Build your legions of armies, hone your magic skills, and gather your resources to wage war on an epic field of battle. Full 3-D graphics, multiplaying capabilities, and an online gaming community add to the adventure.', ""It isn't often that an upstart game company breaks through with a major hit, but when Cavedog released Total Annihilation in late 1997, that's what happened. A year and a half later, Cavedog is trying to follow suit with Total Annihilation: Kingdoms, a fantasy real-time strategy game that is an apparent effort to reclaim the interest of Total Annihilation fans. <P> You can begin to see what's wrong with it right from the start. Although the graphics in Kingdoms are more detailed than those of its science fiction-themed precedent, the jagged-edged polygonal graphic style was far better suited to the rough-hewn metallic shapes of Total Annihilation than the more organic style of Kingdoms' designs. The consequence is that it's not so easy to tell one unit from the next in Kingdoms, and while some look distinctive, such as the kingdom Veruna's massive warships and dirigibles or Zhon's squid-like krakens, many or even most others look plain at best and messy at worst.<P> The Kingdoms graphics engine, only slightly enhanced since Total Annihilation, makes limited use of 3D acceleration to accentuate certain special effects but does not take advantage of your card in order to enhance the game's frame rate or smooth the edges on the polygons. Even if you have a very fast machine, you'll still find that the game's frame rate bogs down noticeably during large-scale battles on account of the software rendering, which not only makes the game look worse than it could have, but proves to be a serious detriment during gameplay. <P> Yet while Kingdoms' graphics aren't all that bad, it's difficult to find anything nice to say about the game's sound effects. The dozens of robotic units in Total Annihilation could be easily forgiven for their plain mechanical noises, which seemed appropriate even if altogether uninspiring. But in Kingdoms, which is evidently modeled after Blizzard's character-driven real-time strategy games, the sound effects are mediocre and often downright bad and cannot be excused as easily because the game professes to have so much more context than its predecessor.<P> At other times, the sound in Kingdoms seems altogether unfinished, and events for which you'd expect audible cues, like unit construction and healing, are strangely silent. Even the game's soundtrack leaves something to be desired, and while the orchestral score is the work of the same Jeremy Soule who lent Total Annihilation its incredible soundtrack, the music in Kingdoms is a missed opportunity to play up the differences between the four warring factions. <P> The story holds up rather well, which is told as though it were a historical narrative, through the static painting montage style of documentary filmmaker Ken Burns. The single-player campaign spans nearly 50 missions, each of which is preceded by a cutscene that sets the stage for the ensuing battle. While the cutscenes are often interesting, just as often, the missions themselves are not. The Total Annihilation engine apparently isn't equipped to handle complex scripted situations, and so the missions' supposed surprises and twists tend to be underwhelming. And aside from the quirkier escort and defense missions, you're stuck with the usual formula of having to wipe out all your enemies. <P> There are few obvious problems with how Kingdoms plays but plenty of more subtle ones. While the game carries over its predecessor's sleek interface, which readily allows you to set unit waypoints and building-production queues, the game moves slowly and feels awkward. You're responsible for only a single resource, which is generated continuously when you build a lodestone on the right spot. Lodestones are fragile, and you'll almost always have to spread yourself thin setting them up, and what's more, they rarely provide you with the kind of resources you'll wish you had. In consequence, your armies must be assembled deliberately and specifically, as certain types of units on each side are simply more effective than their weaker counterparts. Why should Taros build zombies when executioners do the same job so much better? With very little base building and resource management to deal with, your goal in Kingdoms is to assemble a large army as quickly as possible. <P> When you're ready to strike, using combined arms seems neither entirely necessary nor necessarily practical; certain flying units are extremely powerful in groups and can attack without fear of retaliation from the game's more common units that carry short-range weapons. These ground units also tend to get cluttered together, and since certain spells and ballistic attacks affect a wide area, you're liable to lose a great many warriors at once as you try to storm the enemy's position. Defensive structures are very powerful, long-range ballistic weapons are very fragile, and most melee units are so slow that they get mowed down before they can get close enough to attack. Furthermore, unlike ranged units, melee units won't attack their enemies while moving, unless you expressly order them to engage a target. In practice, many of your melee units will stand idly by in combat while the front ranks take a few practice swings, rather than the lot of them surrounding their enemies en masse. <P> For all these reasons, it is difficult to mount a successful attack in Kingdoms. If you let a battle drag on for too long, it's liable to drag on even longer since resources are unlimited and defensive structures so deadly. Since you're restricted to a 250-unit limit, and there are no all-powerful melee or artillery units (nothing like Total Annihilation's Big Bertha cannon), it's easy and tempting to kick back and defend, and watch your enemy waste dozens of troops trying vainly to breach your perimeter. All the while, your defensive units rack up more and more kills, and achieve veteran status, making them even less likely to be eliminated. And should your foe waste the huge amount of time and resources to summon a holy dragon, the superunit of Kingdoms, know that just a few defensive towers placed in close proximity will be able to take it down. With these concerns in mind, it seems almost a moot point to question the play balance between the four sides in the game, which are intriguingly different but perhaps too much so in certain ways. For instance, Veruna is the only kingdom with a serious navy, making it an obvious choice for water maps while the asset goes to waste in any other situation. Then again, the game doesn't include many multiplayer maps in the first place, and there's only a single two-player map in the whole lot. And they all take a really long time to load. <P> The best thing Kingdoms has going for it is that it has no real competition right now. It's not a bad game, and if you're starving for real-time strategy, there's enough in Kingdoms to hold your interest for a while. Cavedog promises to provide new units and maps for download regularly, and the included map editor means you might find another two-player map to play on soon enough. Plus you get free online play courtesy of the Boneyards service, which means Kingdoms can indeed keep you busy if you choose to overlook its problems or find ways to work around them. But the fact is, Kingdoms is not a better game than Total Annihilation, nor does it approach the other real-time strategy games it hopes to emulate. <i>--Greg Kasavin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.
