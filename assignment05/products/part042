M.A.X. 2: Mechanized Assault &amp; Exploration,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games']",{},"[""As its name implies, M.A.X.: Mechanized Assault and Exploration is a conquer and plunder-type strategy game. The goal of M.A.X. is to colonize newly-discovered planets, controlling the resources found there, and defend your colony against other rival factions looking to literally blow you off the planet.\n\nM.A.X. is most notable for its ability to be played as a real-time or more traditional turn-based strategy game, which can significantly impact how the game is played. The length of turns is adjustable, as is game speed, so the game can be as challenging or brain-dead as the player wants. But at its core, M.A.X. is about resource-gathering, building, and tactical combat. The game offers more than 50 land, sea, and air units, most of which can be upgraded to improve their armor, speed, and range. You can play as one of eight different Factions (all of which are explained in a rather lengthy fictional introduction in the manual), either in a complete campaign or in a limitless number of custom missions.

However Willy has a habit of getting into trouble, and naturally that means it will be a challenge to get out of it.\n\nThe Adventures of Willy Beamish is a point-and-click graphical adventure. You play Willy Beamish, an eight year-old kid who is just trying to get through life without losing his lunch money. But he'll have to deal with parents, teachers, babysitters and bratty sisters. The player must solve different puzzles to ensure Willy can progress, get out of trouble and generally avoid ending up grounded.\n\nThe in-game time progresses even if no action is taken. This means many puzzles have to be solved in a certain time frame or rely on being in the right place at the right time. A special aspect of this game is a bar which shows Willy's relationship to his parents. It gets affected by the way certain situations are resolved, e.g. it increases if Willy refuses to play with his sister, and when it is full they send Willy to a military school and the game is lost.""]","by

Ground enemies usually come in large numbers and their attack strengths range from weak to strong. Enemies of the air are just zeppelins and blimps.

Their attack strength range from harmless to the most powerful of the regular enemies.', ""Instead of just fire you have other capabilities, they are water, wind, and earth. The fire breath weapon shoots fireballs that seek out their targets. The magic ability is the ability to increase the power of the fireballs so they cause explosions which kill all the enemies within the area of the explosion. The water breath weapon shoots shards of ice. When they are first shot they are only one, then they break into multiple shards. The accuracy of the attack is low but the multiple shards increase the likeliness of hitting something. A fairly weak attack. However, you can fire them almost every time you press the button. The water magic ability is reflection. You can use this to reflect projectile attacks right back to the area that it was fired from. You still have a little bit of damage inflicted, though. The air breath weapon is lightning. It can be fired very quickly and runs in a straight line. If the lightning lands close to an orc it will still electrocute it and any enemies close to the orc will also be electrocuted. Moderately accurate. The earth breath weapon is an orb of energy that runs in a straight line on the ground. It's also much faster on the ground than in the air. If it lands in the water than it will just disappear in the water. It will hit multiple enemies if they are in a line. The earth breath weapon is an attack for the strategist. The earth magic ability is armor. When armor is activated no damage will come to you. It will not reflect attacks like the water magic ability, though."", 'Gradually over the game, you will gain power that will allow you to increase your levels. Levels are the cut of a gem that increases the power or multitude of shots available. The color of the gem also determines the power you have. Red is fire. Blue is water. White is air. And green is earth. When you gain levels you can remain at that power until the end of the mission, which means that you keep the power level you are on throughout the whole mission. Even when you collect another gem, you can come back and get the the power if there is a gem. There are five levels in all. But you can only them increase by three at the most. As you get more power you can get higher levels. Every time you collect a fire gem, your fire breath weapon becomes more powerful. Each time you collect a water gem you can shoot ice shards much faster. When you get air gems your lightning breath weapon becomes more powerful. And every time you collect an earth gem, your energy sphere becomes more powerful.', 'You can also eat livestock or enemies if you need too, or eat them just for fun. Livestock includes sheep, pigs, and cattle. Orcs include anything that fits in your mouth. Cattle grants you the ability to get fury attacks for a power. You eat the cows alive, not when you roast them with fire, freeze them with water, fry them with lightning, or smash them with your earth breath weapon. Every five cows gives you one fury attack. You can get three altogether. You have a fury attack at the beginning of a mission. And your current power when you release the fury attack determines what the fury attack will be. The fire fury lets you attack with an enduring tongue of flame which is a good attack on the ground and water units. The water fury attack rains down a huge hailstorm which is probably the most powerful fury attack. Best used when fighting bosses. The air fury attack creates a lightning storm that electrocutes all enemies within the area and may spread further. Good against huge numbers. The earth fury attack unleashes an earthquake that is best used on structures. It also effects ground units. It will not effect air units, water units, or the last boss. It is the weakest fury attack.']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation 2', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Dragon Rage is a dragon shooter game, where Cael flies around breathing fire, ice, lightning, and giant rock boulders. If Cael eats 5 cows, he can earn a fury attack. The first level trains Cael and the player to use dragon powers.

The controls are simple and include barrel rolls, picking up rocks, and activating other dragon powers.']","by

Unfortunately, frustrating combat is also back, and dialogues are tedious at times. It\'s still a great game, however, and worthy of every adventurer\'s collection.']","by

Cobra Triangle,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC']",{},"[""NES NINTENDO VIDEO GAME VERSION. GREAT GAME. ALL-TIME CLASSIC. LOTS OF GREAT SUPER FUN. A MUST BUY. GREAT FOR GAMERS AND COLLECTORS. GREAT FOR ALL AGES. HERE IS SOME INFO ON THE GAME. \n\nDescription\nCobra Triangle is a single-player boat-racing game that lets you do more than race. It borrows the power-up system from the shoot 'em up genre but keeps the emphasis more on maneuvering than shooting. Since you have a health meter with a dozen bars in it, it's not that important to dodge bullets unless your health is really low, but you should try not to run into too many walls. In order to get very far you need to make use of your power-ups which are TURBO for better acceleration; FIRE for increased firepower; SPEED for increased top-speed; MISSILE for firing missiles as well as bullets; and FORCE which makes you fire tons of missiles and also makes you invincible for a limited time. You get roughly one minute to complete each level. Speaking of which, there are 7 types of levels each with a different objective:\n\n(1) Race to the Finish - Shoot other boats along the way to the finish line and avoid enemies like turrets and sharks. Some boats tow power-up pods behind them that you can collect after you shoot them. It doesn't matter when you finish, and you aren't told if you get 1st or 2nd or 3rd place... it seems that the other boats are only there to get in your way. Watch for the fork in the river; choosing alternate paths takes you to the same levels of the game but in a different order.\n\n(2) Collect the Pods - Simply race in a straight path while running over ramps to collect pods and 1UP's in the air. You go on to the next level when time runs out.\n\n(3) Dispose of Mines - There is a small square in the water with mines in it. You actually have to collect the mines and tow them to another square to make them explode. Of course, there is an invincible enemy boat that tries to steal them back from you and some guys that shoot at you.""]",Nintendo,"['>#34,108 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#7,497 in Video Games &gt; PC Games']",$7.95,Video Games,B0006TNCWS

Standard, dull ice blocks pose no threat other than an easily disposed of barrier. Ice blocks that appear more square and detailed are indestructible forcing the player to take another path. The darker ice with diagonal lines act as a conveyor belt sliding the Eskimo either to the left or right. Finally, many mountains include cloud-shaped, moving platforms as an additional hurdle. The bonus stage takes place at the peak. With a time limit of 40 seconds and no enemies, the Ice Climbers often face trickier jumps and multiple moving platforms. It is also the only place they can snag back their stolen vegetables, most notably eggplants. At the top of the peak, the condor flies overhead.

Knock your opponents out using devastating combos and the new Haymaker  option. Then go outside the ring for training, while managing your boxer to make him  successful and wealthy. The new EA SPORTS Cutman minimizes damage on fighters by helping  them heal critical wounds between rounds.   Active cut-man helps you recover from swelling eyes between rounds  Dynamic Punch Impacts - stunning visuals reflect the effect of each blow, from swollen eyes to broken ribs', '<P>As much as certain events have made gamers a little bitter at EA\'s business tactics, Fight Night: Round 2 does illustrate what the company is very good at: taking a good thing and making it even better.</P> <P>It\'s obvious that the developers, while continuing to fine-tune the all-analog gameplay, have placed a focus on creating a more compelling career mode. Largely, they\'ve been very successful. The new create-a-boxer is very comprehensive, allowing you to morph almost every aspect of your pugilist\'s appearance on the fly. A new type of match mode, available as a standalone option called Hard Hit Mode, makes an appearance on your schedule as special events. In these events, a round doesn\'t end until someone is knocked down, lending a more brutal, over-the-top feel to the contest. Thankfully, these are optional and, while they can unlock new items in the store, they don\'t usually count against your ranking. For hardcore fans, you\'ll be pleased to note that you can now change weight classes mid-career as you age and that each pro\'s career is made so you\'re fighting era-appropriate foes.</P> <P>On the gameplay side, the most important new aspect is the Haymakers &#8211; powerful blows that allow you to pre-load a punch for extra impact. Of course, using them is risky, but their power makes them an important tool in winning the belt. Although the initial matches are a bit easier than in last year\'s, the difficulty stiffened once my rank climbed to the mid-30s. The AI seems a bit savvier, and opponents will grapple when you\'ve got them nearly knocked out to buy for time. I find it a little strange that rival boxers have an almost Jason Vorhees-like ability to rise from the mat, sometimes recovering from as many as four knockdowns in two rounds, but that\'s a minor quibble.</P> <P>Another nice addition is the ""woozy"" camera angles that appear when you or an opponent is nearly knocked down. It\'s a small touch, but a very dramatic one, just one more of the many little things that EA did right in making Fight Night: Round 2. The sum of these is a game that might just be the best boxing video game to date.</P><BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>After revolutionizing the genre, EA makes an effort to give boxing fans a more well-rounded experience <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>Improves on last year\'s already great visuals &#8211; the facial injuries and sweat are eerily real <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>Great selection of rough n\' ready rap, including the reunited Geto Boys (Yay!) <BR><BR><B>Playability:</B><BR> If anything, the all-analog control is even more fluid this time around <BR><BR><B>Entertainment:</B><BR>A better career mode and more depth make for a better overall game <BR><BR><B>Replay:</B><BR>High <BR><BR>Rated: <B>9.25 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Matt Helgeson</B><BR>Issue: <B>March 2005</B><BR><BR><B>2nd Opinion:</B><BR> With my right and left hands (one is ""Sorrow,"" the other ""Pity"") I have brutalized flesh and shortened the lives of men. This is my career. This is Fight Night Round 2. Footwork, punches, and your defense are now all seamlessly integrated into an irresistibly fluid dance of timely parries and devastating counter-blows. It looks so real you can feel your brain slapping against the inside of your skull. Also more lifelike is the career mode, in which your fighter will actually age, necessitating training and the best equipment. But, nothing makes you feel quite as alive as being in the ring, where sweat and bloody spray are the champagne of victory.

Largely, they\'ve been very successful. The new create-a-boxer is very comprehensive, allowing you to morph almost every aspect of your pugilist\'s appearance on the fly. A new type of match mode, available as a standalone option called Hard Hit Mode, makes an appearance on your schedule as special events. In these events, a round doesn\'t end until someone is knocked down, lending a more brutal, over-the-top feel to the contest. Thankfully, these are optional and, while they can unlock new items in the store, they don\'t usually count against your ranking. For hardcore fans, you\'ll be pleased to note that you can now change weight classes mid-career as you age and that each pro\'s career is made so you\'re fighting era-appropriate foes.</P> <P>On the gameplay side, the most important new aspect is the Haymakers &#8211; powerful blows that allow you to pre-load a punch for extra impact. Of course, using them is risky, but their power makes them an important tool in winning the belt. Although the initial matches are a bit easier than in last year\'s, the difficulty stiffened once my rank climbed to the mid-30s. The AI seems a bit savvier, and opponents will grapple when you\'ve got them nearly knocked out to buy for time. I find it a little strange that rival boxers have an almost Jason Vorhees-like ability to rise from the mat, sometimes recovering from as many as four knockdowns in two rounds, but that\'s a minor quibble.</P> <P>Another nice addition is the ""woozy"" camera angles that appear when you or an opponent is nearly knocked down.

Unless you\'re going for the insane task of collecting every single item in the game, of course (which nets you some bonus stages). Remember the trouble you had with those brutal levels? It\'s infinitely harder to pick up all the goodies on top of beating them in the first place.</P> <P>As much of an irritation as the trouble spots can be, perseverance pays off with Klonoa 2. There\'s a lot of great platforming to be had here, and the infrequent annoyances of those nasty levels and the questionable localization are a small price to pay for the opportunity to revisit the 2D nirvana that so few modern games give us a chance to experience.</P><BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Bring another helping of Klonoa\'s unique puzzling platforming to the GBA <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>Sharp and colorful, the visuals do a good job of drawing you into this cartoony adventure <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>Boring and forgettable, just like most titles on the GBA <BR><BR><B>Playability:</B><BR> It\'s a rare title that creates such a tight link between player and character <BR><BR><B>Entertainment:</B><BR>Despite some punishingly difficult levels, this is head and shoulders above the vast majority of GBA offerings <BR><BR><B>Replay:</B><BR>Moderate <BR><BR>Rated: <B>8.25 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Adam Biessener</B><BR>Issue: <B>March 2005</B><BR><BR><B>2nd Opinion:</B><BR> Ignore the kiddie characters and the ludicrous story &#8211; this game is straight up platform puzzling goodness. The colorful stages are varied and enjoyable, even if the music and sound effects that accompany them aren\'t. The mild variations on the traditional platforming pattern make for a slightly slower paced, but no less enjoyable jaunt as you steadily cross the 2D landscape. Several of the puzzles are downright mean in later levels, a distinction that may not win it a lot of fans with the demographic most attracted to these cutesy visuals. For myself, I would have enjoyed a little more action to keep the pace up, but overall this cat emerges from the proverbial bag as a quality offering for the GBA.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>7 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Matt Miller</B><BR><BR><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Amazon.com</i>']","by

Each of the four main characters has multiple jumping moves that cover great horizontal and vertical distances. Each has unique moves: Yoshi can eat enemies and turn them into eggs that he can throw; Mario can punch, kick and wall-jump to great heights; super-strong Wario can break certain blocks; and Luigi can jump incredibly high. Power Flowers give each character even cooler powers, like invisibility, fire breath or the power to float through the air. Answering an invitation, Mario, Luigi and Wario set out for a royal party with Princess Peach. When they arrive at the castle, though, they find it strangely empty. Meanwhile, Yoshi awakes from a rooftop nap to find the castle eerily silent, with Mario, Luigi and Wario nowhere to be seen. Yoshi soon discovers that Bowser has pilfered the castle's Power Stars and imprisoned the Toads in the castle's immense collection of paintings. It's up to the dynamic dino to figure out what happened to Mario, Luigi and Wario and save the day. \nPlay as Mario, Yoshi, Luigi and even Wario. You'll need to use each one's unique abilities to find 150 Power Stars hidden in the castle and grounds. \nPlay through Adventure mode and try your stylus-wielding hand at tons of new touch-sensitive min-games. \nBattle up to three friends in Wireless Versus mode, which you can play with only one Super Mario 64 DS game card.""]","by

TNN Motorsports Hardcore 4x4,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""You'll need tough studs and big bolts...Get bent over six radical terrains. White knuckle driving and extreme weather conditions. Rampage your rig with actual four wheel independent suspension and real vehicle motion. Gut wrenching multiple views with hard-rocking adrenaline-pumping music. Maxx out your truck crunch the tenders and kiss your competition but don't drive it into the ground."", 'Recent Playstation ""racing"" games haven\'t focused on racing, but rather on weapons (Impact Racing), futuristic spacecraft (WipeOut XL), and cartoon opponents (Street Racer). TNN Motor Sports Hardcore 4X4, however, is truly a racing game. For that reason, and that reason alone, Hardcore 4X4 is a refreshing addition to the Playstation racing game library. However, the same solid racing focus that makes Hardcore 4X4 stimulating is also the game\'s biggest downfall: There are no surprises, no changes in gameplay, and nothing to work towards.  <P>Once past the cumbersome options screen interface, you can select one of six different trucks (each varying in speed, tension, and suspension), and race on one of six different courses (with terrain ranging from dirt, mud, sand, grass, and rock, to ice and snow). Weather conditions, including sunny, overcast (fog, sandstorm), and severe (rain, snow), greatly affect your visibility in both day and night racing. Race types include single race, championship (race on all six courses, vying for points and ranking), and time trial. The performance of your ride is not customizable, except for alterations to the steering response level. <P>The game handles well enough - the action is fast and the control responsive. Graphically, the tracks have a realistic look and feel, with endless bumps, hills, curves, and jumps. One of Hardcore 4X4\'s primary selling points is that it\'s the first racing game to have vehicles with independent suspension. And while it\'s unique to have all four wheels respond differently to the terrain, it really doesn\'t make the game any more exciting (more realistic, perhaps, but not more exciting). Still, the vehicle physics are impressive, with the trucks handling each surface differently, going slower up hills, faster down hills, and so on. Take a turn too quickly and your truck will flip and roll. If nothing else, the game feels right. <P>One of the game\'s primary problems, however, lies in track design. The courses, usually deep down in high-walled canyons (and their surrounding environments), often consist of the same slightly drab colors and textures. This makes it impossible to see the track ahead - an overhead map or directional indicator would have greatly reduced the time spent crashing into walls. The long, winding courses are also far too narrow, and much like the claustrophobic speedways in the original Destruction Derby, there\'s little room to maneuver. And there\'s nothing to run over or crush with your truck - just lots of dirt and rocky roads to navigate. <P>Simply, you drive a truck over dirt roads and race against a handful of faceless opponents. With only six courses and no new levels or hidden tracks, Hardcore 4X4 is worth a weekend rental, but has little long term replay value. --Jeff Kitts <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

New to the 2006 version is the use of the left analog stick for deking, which in hockey terms means to dodge and fake out defenders. The right analog stick is used to pull off fancy moves like a spin or between the legs pass. These fancy moves will distract goalkeepers, giving the gamer an opening to shoot. The drawback to these moves is that only superstar characters can pull them off regularly. The game includes many of the traditional hockey game modes, including dynasty mode. In dynasty mode, gamers will control their own hockey team and have to deal with outside pressures, sponsors, and more while trying to meet the team philosophy, which is different for each team. Other modes include single season, leagues and tournaments, and quick game. The graphics of NHL 06 are top notch. This time, they've been tweaked to accurately show character size differences. The defense players and goalkeepers, who are traditionally larger players, actually look larger, while the smaller and faster scorers are indeed a little thinner and smaller.

Armored Fist 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""The M1A2 Abrams is America's main battle tank. It is a 60-ton monster with a 1,500 horsepower engine that drives it at speeds up to 65 miles an hour. It can roll over a car like you roll over in bed. Its 120mm cannon can spit a shell of penetrating high-explosive shot 3000 meters, instantly destroying any piece of armor that any nation could field. The modern tank battles it was designed to fight are characterized by fast speeds and long distances. An enemy doesn't even know the Abrams is there until that round of HEAT comes through his turret. In the Gulf War it was not unusual to read of four M1A2s destroying three dozen Iraqi tanks in about twenty minutes, with the Abrams not suffering a scratch. The Iraqis couldn't count a single destroyed Abrams on their butcher's bill during the war. <P> All these things were in my mind as I loaded up Armored Fist 2 and set about exploring the world that NovaLogic had prepared for my entertainment. I began by attempting to drive my tank around and see the sites. There was a nice tutorial with an authoritative-sounding commander shouting orders in order to help me understand navigation, weapons handling, and combined-arms warfare. There were four speed settings I could use: stop, 1/4, 1/2, and full. Engaging any one of them immediately sent the tank on its proscribed course without any steering or input from me. When I did want to steer - say, to avoid a boulder that we were about to drive over - the speed setting disengaged and the tank stopped. My first lesson: Tank drivers can't steer and move ahead at half power at the same time. (They need to use a manual throttle control.) <P> But at least we were under way! I wanted to see what my new hi-tech M1 could do to the slightly chunky and woefully choppy scenery that NovaLogic had provided for me, so I started to drive over things. Well, that was the plan. Nothing, however, could be crushed, or even budged, by my 60-ton truck running at full speed. Not other tanks, not fuel storage, not trucks, not water towers, not even tents and netting. Only supply depots would blow up when I hit them. I wasn't thinking too highly of my new tank. Aren't large explosions supposed to ensue when a tank runs into, for instance, a tanker full of fuel? It was my first hint that all the hype about this M1A2 Abrams had been just that: hype. <P> A modern tank commander has state-of-the-art technology at his fingertips to survey the situation, communicate with the other tanks in his platoon, and deliver ordinance on target. A crew of four drives the tank, loads shot, fires the cannon, and monitors the hi-tech instruments. I didn't see any hi-tech instruments in my particular tank, and while I found that the crew handled themselves pretty well, the other tanks in my platoon were a positive disgrace: missing their targets and exposing themselves to fire. Maybe it was because I just didn't have the ability to give them proper orders: All I could do was set a formation and tell them to move, stop, fire, and don't fire. Heck, I couldn't even move a waypoint without replotting my entire course. Maybe it was my leadership that was poor, and not them... I began to feel a bit better about the Abrams when I opened fire with my machine gun. To my amazement, this rather humble device was so powerful that a short burst from it would level a three-story building! I hadn't realized that bullets could do that. Nor had I realized that a tracked vehicle could climb a 60-degree incline at well-nigh full speed. I was feeling good. My tank could do things no other tank could. This good feeling persisted right up until I got into some action. <P> That's right: There were foes to crush in Africa, The Soviet Union (I thought that didn't exist any more), Belarus, and someplace else. It doesn't matter. All the locations had the same washed out, chunky look to them, and all the missions (something like 50 of 'em) seemed to take place within a few hundred square yards. For a tank that's supposed to engage enemies from over a mile away, I found these close quarters cramping. It was also pretty disconcerting to have weaker enemies kill my tanks - tanks that have never suffered a battlefield loss - while my sabot and HEAT rounds bounced harmlessly off their shells. I soon grew bored with missions in faraway areas, because no matter what the goal or location or time of day, they all felt exactly the same and all took place in a small, confining areas. <P> It was a sore disappointment to me. I had been led to believe that Yankee know-how was the best in the world, yet here was a hi-tech armored vehicle that was half white elephant and half super machine, and not in the right halves. I didn't feel like I'd had fun with my tank. I just felt taken for a ride. And a bumpy one at that. <i>--Chet Thomas</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.
