Think you could do it? What if it had to be done with balloons? Or perhaps using so many variables that it looks like a Rube Goldberg machine? Of course this is a pretty ridiculous request, but assuming the suspension of everyday reality and belief, and an assortment of malleable if unlikely objects, could you make it happen? This is the crux of <i>Create</i>. Consisting of a large series of puzzle challenges tending towards the outrageous, players must use their imaginations and objects provided or already part of their in-game possessions to succeed. With success comes additional items that can be used in later endeavors, if not ruled out by the challenge at hand. Challenges are set within a variety of base game worlds that can also be customized using an in-game toolset. Creations can also be saved, reused, edited and even shared with others online.

Hordes of violent monsters roam the outskirts of town, a long-dormant volcano has suddenly become active again, and the new lord of the land has been taxing the citizens heavily. As Adol and Dogi begin to search for the sources of Felghana's recent struggles, they find each clue leads them more and more towards the disturbing conclusion that these events are all somehow linked. Play as Adol in this re-imagining of the classic third game in the Ys series. A fully explorable 3D world with added voice-overs on all story-advancing scenes, an overhauled battle system for stream-lined play, and a rearranged soundtrack that builds upon the critically-acclaimed original music are just some of the features that bring this classic up to modern standards.

It's powered by custom IBM PowerPC-based CPU with three symmetrical cores each running at 3.2 GHz. It also carries a custom ATI graphics processor 10 MB of embedded DRAM. This is powerful enough to draw 500 million triangles per second. In other words, it makes for great looking games in standard TV definition, and even better thanks to built-in support for HDTV 1080i televisions. It also supports the widescreen 16:9 format."", 'The unit has a 12x dual-layer DVD-ROM drive, which plays both the game media and progressive-scan DVD movies right out of the box. For game-save and media storage, users can choose between the detachable and upgradeable 20GB hard drive, which is included in this bundle, or a separately sold 64MB flash Memory Unit. Along with storing files, the hard drive will make the Xbox 360 backward-compatible with part of the existing Xbox game library.', 'Xbox 360 uses a refined button layout for its controllers. Back and Start buttons sit at the center of the controller and between them is a new Xbox Guide button, which instantly takes the user to the Xbox 360 user interface. From there, they can check for friends online, access personal digital content like photos and songs, and more. The black and white buttons of the first Xbox controllers have been replaced with new shoulder buttons placed above the left and right triggers. Xbox 360 can accommodate up to four wireless controllers and has three USB 2.0 slots to use for wired controllers or for streaming your digital media from digital cameras, MP3 players, and any Windows XP-based PC. Microsoft has announced plans for a upcoming video-conferencing camera that will work with the system.', ""<b>About Xbox 360 Games and Media</b><br> Xbox 360 is scheduled to launch with more than 20 launch titles, with several more slated to be released within the following month.

All Xbox 360 titles can be played in either standard or high-definition resolution in 16:9 widescreen, with anti-aliasing for smoother graphics.

Building on the Call of Duty 4&reg;: Modern Warfare engine, Call of Duty&reg;: World at War immerses players into the most gritty and chaotic WWII combat ever experienced. Players band together to survive the most harrowing and climactic battles of WWII that led to the demise of the Axis powers on the European and Pacific fronts. The title offers an uncensored experience with unique enemies and combat variety, including Kamikaze fighters, ambush attacks, Banzai charges and cunning cover tactics. Experience Call of Duty&#8217;s intense and addictive action designed specifically for the Wii&#8482; with new features like Squadmate Mode and Combat-Look technology, all with full Wii&#8482; Zapper support. Features: Squadmate Mode: This single-screen cooperative mode lets players team up to play alongside friends and family. At any moment, a second Wii Remote can be activated, giving the second player their own aiming crosshair to provide cover and added firepower while fighting alongside their Squadmate. Wii Zapper Support: Fully supports Nintendo's innovative and unique Zapper controller through a customized game setting that allows the entire game, including multiplayer and Squadmate Mode, to be played with the Zapper. This customized setting adds a new way to play by incorporating unique gestures and button layouts that add to the Call of Duty experience. Combat-Look: Includes &#8220;Combat-Look&#8221; technology &#8211; as the player runs through the game's diverse environments and topographies, the vertical line of sight discreetly adapts to keep players focused on the battlefield without having to radically adjust for uphill/downhill grade variations in the terrain. This system still allows complete freedom and mobility for targeting and results in a smoother and more playable Wii experience""]","by

Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy game genre, this game is an instant classic.\nYour allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio, monitoring your progress, offering tips--but failing to give you the full story. The combination of a mysterious and engaging plot and high in-game tension makes this a thrilling ride. Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom. A user-friendly control interface allows for sniping, hiding, crawling, and running, and the graphics leave nothing to be desired. If you like espionage, spy movies, or just want to own and play a piece of gaming history, then this is a must have. Metal Gear Solid is one of the all-time greats. Game tip: Secretly attach plastic explosives behind an enemy, sneak out of the room, and see what happens. --Allen Stewart""]","by

The loss of Dien Bien Phu struck a death knell for the French effort to retain control of their former colony of Indochina. For the Viet Minh it was a long sought victory over significant French forces and heralded an end to this first phase of their war of liberation from their imperial masters. The war had begun 8 years previously in the wake of World War II and would end 21 long years later with the fall of Saigon in 1975. Dien Bien Phu covers the period of 1946 - 1954 when a polyglot force of Moroccans, Senegalese, Algerians, Legionnaires, Vietnamese, Thos and others under the auspices of the French sought to retain France's hold on Indochina and were opposed by the nationalist communist forces of the Viet Minh. <br<br>Dien Bien Phu conjures up many images for the average war gamer, a bloody, muddy siege, the failure of a colonial empire to hold onto it's possessions in the aftermath of World War II, the Legion Etrangere holding positions to the end, paratroopers dropping into a doomed situation, the list goes on. However, the French Indochina War was much more than that. In the Legion tradition, small outposts and their defense were a fixture throughout the war. There were riverine assaults, a tactic that would bloom in the American War 10+ years later. Aggressive paradrops were a regular feature before the development of the heliborne assault. There were convoys and endless patrols. In this latest edition to the Squad Battles series you will get to experience all of these situations and more. Added ability to give random probability to withdraws defined in a scenario Altered the A/I scripts dialog within the editor to facilitate the creation of A/I scripts Multiple A/I enhancements for movement, targeting and assaults Added Hull Down feature set in the scenario editor for armor.""]","by

You'll stomp buildings, crush cars, and even take down innocent pedestrians in your strides to do as much damage as possible. Parents can rest assured: although the game's focus is on tearing apart the scenery, there's little of the blood and gore that pervades many video games these days. There are more than 130 stages to romp through in this tribute to silver screen terrors, and each level presents all-new challenges and more difficult gameplay. If you're familiar with the RAMPAGE series, you'll love the inclusion of three new monsters to take the place of the familiar faces from the original game.

Spend your time with pleasure and to your benefit!', '<i>World Voyage</i> is a unique combination of classical match3 mechanism and original tools, features, and bonuses. The new features change the traditional appearance that is characteristic for most match3 games. There are timer balls that turn into locks after certain time, thus making you think harder to pass to another level. Two or more locks create a line that limits your space in the game, requiring resourcefulness and skill. Such a feature highly increases the game&#39;s replayability, so that you will never get bored! No doubt you will also enjoy a significant number of various remarkable bonuses, which can last for several levels if not used. The marvelous colorfulness of <i>World Voyage</i> will exhilarate you at once. Every 5th level the background changes, displaying fine colors of morning, afternoon, evening or night time. Besides traditional match3 levels there are mini-puzzles of famous places. By working out a puzzle you enrich your main menu landscape. One by one you will add the Statue of Liberty, Taj Mahal, the Kremlin, Eiffel&#39;s Tower and many others. To pass through 100 levels and to fill the landscape with all twenty most celebrated places is the main purpose of WorldVoyage.', 'Are you ready to show your playing skills and to admire the breathtaking glory of great sights?

Following the invasion, the World Alliance Military builds a new cutting-edge weapon, the Raiden Supersonic Attack Fighter, based on a destroyed alien craft, is created for humanity\'s hope for survival.\n[edit]Gameplay\n\nThe formula of the game is simple and typical for the era of this game. The player pilots the ""Raiden Supersonic Attack Fighter"" through waves of enemies, and several levels. There are three types of weapons, and the player can collect several powerups for them to make them stronger. There are bombs and missile powerups as well as collectable medals which add to the score.\n[edit]Fighter\nRaiden fighter always starts with vulcan main weapon.\nWhen player dies, the fighter drops items, based on the former fighter\'s weapon powers.\n[edit]Weapons\nMain weapon.

There are 4 weapon levels:\nHoming Missile: Fires enemy chasing missiles.\nNuclear Missile: Fires forward-concentrating missiles. When it hits an enemy, the blast persists for a short period.\nBomb: Destroys bullets on screen, and damages enemies in the blast area. There is a moment of delay between pressing bomb button and explosion.\nWhen a player\'s fighter shoots the other player\'s fighter, the attacker\'s projectiles transform into \'stars\' that radiates from the attacked fighter.\nWhen player dies, the fighter\'s fragments become projectiles that damage enemies.\n[edit]Items\nRed icon: Switches main weapon type to vulcan main shot. If the fighter already uses the weapon, the weapon power level is increased by 1, or gets 5000 points if weapon power is already full.\nBlue icon: Switches main weapon type to laser main shot.']","by

The game is designed for four-player co-op, and even in single-player modes, a second player can drop in and out of the battle at any time. Although modern military shooter action is the substance of Red River, the violent combat is presented through the personal experiences of the main characters, a small team of Marine Corps infantrymen. The adventure plays out in the landlocked country of Tajikistan, bordered by Afghanistan to the south and China to the east. Leading in from earlier Operation Flashpoint briefings, threats from the People\'s Liberation Army play a significant role as the game\'s narrative develops, but much of the game takes place to the north and west, along the banks of the Vakhsh, known as the ""Red River"" to the people who live there.

Throwing a dart depends on four different factors: position, curve, angle and power. The graphics are simple but effective, and the energetic music keeps things lively.
