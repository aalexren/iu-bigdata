The ultranationalist Russian leader Zakhaev has been eliminated, but it seems that his lieutenant, Vladimir Makarov, is an even bigger danger. Having made a successful play for power, Intel indicates that he is extending the reach of his influence well beyond the borders of Mother Russia, causing a stir in the international community and prompting the involvement of Task Force 141. Task Force 141 is an elite multinational unit made up of Navy Seals, Delta Force operatives, British SAS and CIA. In the single player campaign you are Sergeant Gary ""Roach"" Sanderson, with the hero of <i>Call of Duty 4</i>, ""Soap"" MacTavish, promoted to Captain, making an appearance as an NPC (non-player character) and your commanding officer. The elimination of Makarov and his underlings at any cost is your number one priority, regardless where the fight occurs. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> The latest release in arguably the most successful tactical first-person shooter franchise of all-time, gameplay in <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> follows the same winning and time-tested structure of earlier games in the series. In the single player campaign players are aided by AI squad members as they take on a series of missions aimed at eliminating Ultranationalist forces. Each mission is built around a particular objective, with players utilizing some level of guidance from NPC characters, including ""Soap"" MacTavish, and aided in navigation by the game\'s heads up display (HUD). Along the way players will be able to utilize a wide variety of weaponry and and vehicles, as well as be able to customize weapons with gadgets attached to them. <p/> Also, just as in previous games in the series, <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> is heavily focused on multiplayer gameplay. The different multiplayer modes, available both in local play and online, contain plenty of customization options and revolve around different strategies ranging from the every man for himself action of ""Free-for All,"" the classic team-based fun of ""Capture the Flag and the tactical, team-oriented action of ""Search and Destroy,"" just to name a few. Multiplayer modes also feature the ""Perk"" System that players may be familiar with from earlier in the franchise. Through this system players gain additional abilities, weapons and benefits as they gain experience in combat. This can be done by leveling up, but another important way way is through ""kill streaks,"" the number of enemies eliminated in succession. These are available beginning with three kills and include the ability to call for supply drops, predator missile strikes, helicopter gunships and many more. Players have the ability to customize in advance which perks will be available at each number and can even gauge their progress towards each at the touch of a button. With an eye towards not making the game too hard for new players the game also features help to players experiencing ""death streaks,"" multiple consecutive deaths in multiplayer matches. <p/> <b>Special Ops Co-op Mode</b><br/> Along with a single player mode and multiple multiplayer modes, <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> also features an unique third main play option, Special Ops mode. Available both online and in local play, Special Ops Mode is designed to provide a distinct time-based play option, featuring special scenarios not found in other modes in the game and lots of enemies to take on. This mode can be played either alone or with a friend, again either locally or online, with local co-op play including split-screen functionality. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Challenging Multiplayer Modes</b> &ndash; <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> will contain a wealth of multiplayer modes including: the every man for himself action of ""Free-for All,"" the classic team-based fun of ""Capture the Flag and the tactical, team-oriented action of ""Search and Destroy.""</li> <li><b>Improved AI Enemies</b> &ndash; Improved artificial intelligence now allows enemies to attack from virtually any direction as players respawn into the game adding additional challenges.</li> <li><b>An All-new <i>Call of Duty</i> Adventure</b> - <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> features an all new <i>Call of Duty</i> storyline revolving around the continuing struggles against the Russian rebel group the Ultranationalists, who have found a new and more dangerous leader.</li> <li><b>The \'Special Ops\' Optional Co-op Mode</b> &ndash; ""Special Ops"" Mode allows two players, either alone or with a friend, to engage in unique mission play and features split-screen functionality.</li> <li><b>Diverse In-game Environments</b> - Battlegrounds traversed in the game range from the lonely, snow-clad mountains of Kazakhstan, to dark tunnels in the Afghanistan and the crowded slums of Rio.</li> <li><b>Nonstop Action</b> - <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> contains no cutscenes, so players are always engaged in the action, no matter where they are in the game.</li> <li><b>New Breach Gameplay Mechanic</b> - Players can now blaze their own paths through the game by ""Breaching"" formerly impregnable obstacles like Walls and doors with explosives.</li> <li><b>New Gadgets, Weapons and Weapons System</b> <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> contains many new and updated weapons, new weapons attachments, as well as a variant of the multiplayer weapons customization system from <i>Call of Duty 4</i>, now available in the single player campaign.</li> <li><b>New Perks and Increased Customization</b> - Multiplayer modes feature new perks for leveling up, and for killstreaks and deathstreaks.

Players can customize their character with a preset range of body types and attire, as they prepare themselves to fight their way through the game\'s 12 venues using the precise and varied capabilities of the PlayStation Move motion controller. Each venue is populated with a variety of opponents that will need to be defeated, with the final clash in each fought against a boss. Bosses are different from the lower level fighters that proceed them in that they have particular skills and/or styles that the player will not have encountered in earlier opponents.

Weapons range from a cross that can be extended into a whip with grapple capabilities, to a gauntlet, knives and more. As players wield these they will gain access to energy orbs that reveal themselves as enemies are dispatched. This energy is stored in on-screen gauges and powers multiple kinds of usable magic within the game. Some of its uses involved improve attacks, while the other aids reflect regenerative health. It is the players choice to juggle where these energies are applied. The availability of energy can also be increased by avoiding the attacks of enemies as you battle them, with the payoff coming when they are bested.', 'In addition to run of the mill bad guys, the game contains loads of huge bosses, success against which requires patience, attention to screen prompts and timing. The player will also come up against many other creatures that although vulnerable to weapons can also be defeated and tamed by Gabriel. In many cases these can then be used as mounts and used either in boss battles or in puzzle-solving scenarios that may not be able to be solved without them. These potential mounts include wargs, spiders, warthogs and more.

Intended for children ages 3-6, the game is designed to teach basic skills to prepare kids for success in kindergarten and provide a foundation for further learning. The game's main character, Reader Rabbit, and his sidekick, Sam the Lion, are flying their airship over a new island when they are mysteriously captured by a giant bubble wrap. They then come to realize they have landed in Balloon Town, an island made of balloons where all sharp objects including their airship are locked away in a palace. In order to free their airship and continue on their journey, they must first gain access to the palace by helping the band wake-up the sleeping bull in front of the palace. To do this they must gather the 5 different instruments for the band that have been scattered around Balloon Town. In order to receive an instrument, players must help Reader Rabbit and Sam in a series of educational mini-games designed to teach kids basic skills such as memory, recognizing patters, simple math, phonics, rhyming, following directions and placing items in order. All mini-games have simplistic point-and-click controls using the Nintendo DS touch screen interface. Once players have retrieved all of the instruments and gained access to the palace, they must complete two more mini-games (a listening comprehension/sequencing game and a reading skills game) before gaining access to their airship so they can continue on to a new adventure. The game is presented in a colorful cartoon style with short videos, full voice acting, and sing-along songs designed to engage young children while still teaching basic skills. Players will be able to adjust the difficulty level of all mini-games independently which can add hours of replay value.""]","by

SteelSeries Xai High Performance Laser Gaming Mouse (Black),"September 14, 2004","['Laser gaming mouse', '8 Programmable buttons']","['Video Games', 'PC', 'Accessories', 'Gaming Mice']",{},"['The technology, shape, size, weight and surface of the SteelSeries Xai were designed with one purpose: to enhance the users performance. The sensor offers huge improvement over current laser mice, processing 12,000 Frames Per Second at movement speeds of 150 Inches Per Second. SteelSeries Xai can be fully configured via a LCD menu system on the back of the mouse, while supporting advanced macro capabilities of up to 200 strokes per button. Advanced software allows configuration of SteelSeries FreeMove, SteelSeries ExactSens, SteelSeries ExactAim, SteelSeries ExactRate, plus automatic lift distance calibration. SteelSeries Xai is a tool - not a gadget.', '<div class=""aplus"" >', 'SteelSeries Xai is a tool - not a gadget. The SteelSeries Xai Laser Mouse features state of the art technology and groundbreaking technical specifications. The technology, shape, size, weight and surface of the SteelSeries Xai were designed with one purpose: to enhance the users performance. Research and development was done in close cooperation with fulltime professional gamers from USA, Europe and Asia.', 'With the LCD display on the backside of the SteelSeries Xai mouse, you can customize all settings to fit your specific needs. If you choose to download the advanced software for Xai, there are even more detailed options to customize and personalize your mouse settings.', ""There's no need to install software of any kind to use the Xai. The built-in driver can be adjusted through an LCD menu on the backside of the mouse. Just plug in the Xai and play."", ""On the SteelSeries Xai you can record 8 macros for key combinations that can be up to 200 different keystrokes and with a precise timing of sequences. This allows you to setup common commands and shortcuts that enhance your actions per minute and ensures that you don't accidentally hit the wrong key and miss out on important in-game sequences."", 'SteelSeries ExactAim makes it possible to adjust the way the SteelSeries Xai gets information from the laser sensor. For instance, if you have a surface that is not optimized for gaming, with ExactAim you can simply adjust the jitter and prediction corrections. For optimal use of the Xai we strongly recommend the SteelSeries 9HD mousepad, which was developed simultaneously with the Xai and features a prism-like textured surface for maximum performance for next generation mice.', 'SteelSeries ExactSens allows you to control how fast your pointer should move by adjusting your CPI in increments of 1 between 100-5001. This means the SteelSeries Xai offers you true hardware-based sensitivity settings, freeing you of interpolation from game software. To take advantage of ExactSens you need to deactivate any cursor acceleration and set your sensitivity settings in-game (sensitivity 1 or adjust your sensitivity slider to lowest possible setting) and on your operating system to default.', 'SteelSeries ExactRate enables you to adjust the rate of which data is sent from the SteelSeries Xai to your computer. When tweaking the ExactRate to the response time of your screen you can make the mouse cursor movement perfectly fluent.', 'To make sure you always have a 1mm lift distance the sensor on the SteelSeries Xai automatically adjusts the lift distance depending on the surface you&#8217;re using. If you are a low sensitivity gamer a minimal lift distance is extremely important so that the mouse will shut off the sensor when you lift your mouse up to change positions.', 'SteelSeries FreeMove eliminates path correction, which makes the mouse predict, correct and make your movement straight. With the SteelSeries Xai, you can adjust the amount of path correction or completely disable it for 100% control of your movement. For FPS games that require high precision, this is a crucial feature.', 'The SteelSeries Xai allows you to configure and store up to 5 profiles on the mouse. This helps you easily switch between profiles when playing different games or performing tasks on your computer that require different levels of sensitivity and precision. You can also exchange your setting profiles with other Xai users as well as try downloading a profile from a few professional gamers who&#8217;ve used the Xai to win major global tournaments.', ""Although no software installation is required to use the Xai, the SteelSeries Xai can be configured with simple software which is available in the downloads section of the SteelSeries site. If you want to get the maximum use of all the Xai's features including macro settings, acceleration, profile settings and more, then the software menu should be your next destination."", 'The SteelSeries Xai is ambidextrous, which means that unlike other SteelSeries mice like the Ikari which was designed for the right hand only, you can use the Xai as a righty or lefty gamer.', 'SteelSeries Xai High Performance Laser Gaming Mouse and software.', '<i>""The Xai is in every way equal to the SteelSeries Ikari - the hands-down best gaming mouse of all time that received a whooping 97% in October 2008 - except for one thing: It\'s ambidextrous, with two thumb buttons on each side.""</i><br />--PCGamer.com', '<i>""... the SteelSeries Xai is quite simply the best pure gaming mouse we\'ve ever tested.""</i><br />--Edward Chester, TrustedReviews.com', '<i>""In terms of ergonomics, the Xai is fantastic.

And why not, since what sim doesn\'t need a vacation. Players choose from environments set Egypt, France or China, with the possibility of others via download. Similarly, gameplay follows the same well-worn path familiar to veteran<i>The Sims</i> players, and easy to pick up for those coming to the franchise for the first time. Players create their sims as they like, customizing everything from physical characteristics, all the way down to personality traits, habits, etc. They can mix with other sims, build relationships, start families and even die. Because this expansion is based around travel, your sims can also discover rich, new cultures, develop brand-new skills and abilities and explore and adventure through realistic environments. New skills related to these destinations include photography, martial arts, and nectar making (a sim beverage) among others. As part of of the exotic locales available, sims can get adventurous and explore the caves and tombs of Egypt and China. Here they will put their new adventure related abilities to work as they participate in Indiana Jones like adventures full of excitement and even danger, including some not-so friendly mummies and the Grim Reaper. <p/> <b>Unique Simlish Soundtrack</b><br/> Just as with travel, every sim has his/her particular musical tastes. With that in mind the <i>World Adventures Expansion Pack</i> features an all-star soundtrack of real songs, recorded by the original artists in the sims native tongue of Simlish.

The truth in this can be seen in the fact that in an era dominated by more advanced game consoles, fans of the franchise who have held on to their PS2\'s still revisit these two games from time to time, while gamers who missed their initial releases are tempted to give them a try, even though they have moved on to a PS3. Regardless which side of this you find yourself on the <i>God of War Collection</i> holds something for you. Released in advance of the highly anticipated <i>God of War III</i>, the first game in the series developed for the PS3 platform and rumored to also be the last overall, this collection allows players to properly prepare themselves for the final chapter in the adventures of Kratos, entirely through their PS3. <p/> <font size=""+1"">The Games</font> <p/> <b><i>God of War</i></b><br/> Unleash the power of the gods and embark on a merciless quest as Kratos, an ex-Spartan warrior driven to destroy Ares, the God of War. Armed with the lethal double chainblades known as the Blades of Chaos, Kratos must carve through mythology&rsquo;s darkest creatures &mdash; including Medusa, Cyclops, the Hydra and more, while solving intricate puzzles in breathtaking environments. Driven by pure revenge, nothing can stop Kratos from achieving absolution. Over time, Kratos becomes the most vicious warrior in Ancient Greece and bathed in blood to a point where he can\'t bare it anymore and sets out on a journey to kill Ares. However, the only way to destroy Ares is to find Pandora\'s Box, which is located in a temple that\'s perched upon a hill and guarded by traps, puzzles, enemies, etc. The story is told as a flashback of three weeks prior to where the opening movie cutscene starts and then sets the stage for the game. <p/> <b><i>God of War II</i></b><br/> <i>God of War</i> saw Kratos, a mortal warrior, set upon an epic quest to dethrone a god. But his journey did not end there. In <i>God of War II</i>, Kratos, the once mortal warrior turned ruthless god, sits atop his throne on Olympus, and is a threat far worse than his predecessor Ares had ever been, striking down anyone who crosses his path, or the path of his beloved Sparta. Filled with power and rage, the ""Ghost of Sparta"" sets out to alter that which no mortal or god has ever changed &#151; his fate. Facing mythical characters, all bent on preventing him from reaching his goal, Kratos\' journey brings him to the very edge of the Earth. But this is Kratos, and his defiance is filled with such arrogance and contempt that all of the ancient world still trembles at his name: Kratos, The God of War. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><i>God of War</i> and <i>God of War II</i> on one Blu-ray Disc.</li> <li>Remastered in high-definition at a resolution of 720p.</li> <li>Anti-aliased graphics for 60 frames per second gameplay.</li> <li>Full PlayStation Network (PSN) Trophies support for each game.</li> <li>Purchase includes a PSN voucher for the <i>God of War III</i> E3 2009 Demo.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

This game has the answer: they landed on a planet orbiting Alpha Centauri and quickly divided into feuding factions, each bent on molding the new world according to the group's particular philosophy or culture. But the human colonists are not alone. Alpha Centauri employs the same basic gameplay, rules, and concepts as Civilization II , but features enhanced diplomacy and a new, slicker interface. Players begin by assuming leadership of one of seven colony factions, establishing a base on the unexplored world.

Just then, something falls out of the sky and hits him on the head. Instead of raining raindrops, the sky is raining raingear! So Sam the Lion and Reader Rabbit climb into their fabulous Dreamship and soar up into the sky. They follow the path of falling raingear to Cloud Nine, where they meet Queen Cumulus, queen of the Cloud People. Queen Cumulus explains that a steady stream of raingear is being thrown onto Cloud Nine. The raingear has formed a pile so tall that it is starting to topple over-causing raingear to fall down onto Wordville. The queen thinks the raingear is coming from a funny island below Cloud Nine. So Reader Rabbit and Sam the Lion zoom to the island in the Dreamship to check it out. Reader Rabbit and Sam the Lion discover that the island is full of strange trees that grow raingear. The island is called Raingear Island, and it's the home of Irvin the Inventor. Irvin hates rain, so he invented a machine that throws raingear at the clouds to make them go away. But when Irvin hears how much trouble the raingear is causing, he agrees to turn off his machine. There's just one problem. To turn off his machine, Irvin needs three things-a big, round, purple hoop; a bag of extra-stretchy, jumbo rubber bands; and an extra-soft, double-stuffed feather pillow. But he doesn't have any of the three. Can you help Reader Rabbit and Sam the Lion explore Cloud Nine and Raingear Island in search of the things that Irvin needs? If you find the three items and bring them back to Irvin, he will turn off his machine and stop the avalanche of raingear. But don't delay-the pile of raingear is getting bigger by the minute. If you wait too long, it might topple over and bury Wordville!""]","by

The ambush was set up by the pesky pirates, who desperately want to capture the Dreamship. One cheese ball hits the Dreamship, and a second sweeps Reader Rabbit and Sam overboard. Luckily, they collide with a hovercraft and land safely on Mt. Cheeseopolitan Island, a small island made of cheese. Meanwhile, the Dreamship crash-lands on nearby Mt. Cheesemore Island. The hovercraft is piloted by Professor Heathormen, a famous scientist who studies insects. Reader Rabbit and Sam want to borrow the hovercraft to travel to Mt. Cheesemore Island and find the Dreamship. But the collision badly damaged the hovercraft, so the professor must fix it before it can go anywhere. Unfortunately, the barrels that hold his repair materials-macaroni fruit, blue cheese bricks, and French bread loaves-are completely empty. Can you help Reader Rabbit and Sam explore Mt. Cheeseopolitan Island in search of repair materials for the hovercraft? Be sure to collect enough items to fill up each of Professor Heathormen's barrels. Then help the professor with his insect work so that he'll have time to fix the hovercraft. Soon you'll be on your way to Mt. Cheesemore Island to look for the Dreamship! Be careful! Once you find the Dreamship, you'll need to sneak by the hungry pirates who are guarding it. And even after you finally board the Dreamship, you'll face one last surprise before you can head home to Wordville!

Intended for children ages 3-6, the game is designed to teach basic skills to prepare kids for success in kindergarten and provide a foundation for further learning. The game's main character, Reader Rabbit, and his sidekick, Sam the Lion, are flying their airship over a new island when they are mysteriously captured by a giant bubble wrap. They then come to realize they have landed in Balloon Town, an island made of balloons where all sharp objects including their airship are locked away in a palace. In order to free their airship and continue on their journey, they must first gain access to the palace by helping the band wake-up the sleeping bull in front of the palace. To do this they must gather the 5 different instruments for the band that have been scattered around Balloon Town. In order to receive an instrument, players must help Reader Rabbit and Sam in a series of educational mini-games designed to teach kids basic skills such as memory, recognizing patters, simple math, phonics, rhyming, following directions and placing items in order. All mini-games have simplistic point-and-click controls using the Wii Remote. Once players have retrieved all of the instruments and gained access to the palace, they must complete two more mini-games (a listening comprehension/sequencing game and a reading skills game) before gaining access to their airship so they can continue on to a new adventure.

But something just crashed into the top of Mount Brill. Now the mountain is blocked, and the sparkles can't come out. The only way to unblock Mount Brill is by creating energy at the bottom that can blast through whatever is blocking the top.

Ever since the Great War ended, the Order of the Dragon Slayers has had eyes only for their number one enemy: the Dragon Knights who killed their Divine hero. But all the while the true enemy, the Black Ring, still festers beneath the surface poised to strike, for their leader Damian tirelessly plots silent schemes with utterly malign intent. Then one day, an event takes place that will reshape the history of Rivellon: a dying Dragon Knight gives her powers to a member of the order that seeks to destroy her: you. Perhaps you, blessed as you are with the powers of the Dragon, will be able to stop the black tides that threaten to engulf Rivellon. Many adventures await you, many mysteries yearn to be unraveled and all the world awaits the outcome of your new destiny. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Divinity II: Ego Draconis</i> like its predecessors, <i>Divine Divinity</i> and <i>Beyond Divinity</i>, is a single player RPG utilizing the standard system of experience point accumulation to level up characters to meet the growing challenges faced. Except in cases where the storyline requires specific series of events and environments, the game features a seamless gameworld, that for the most part players are free to explore. This along with a moral component to decision making, 20 possible quest solutions and varied non-player character (NPC) reactions makes for gameplay pleasing to any RPG fan. <p/> In addition, like <i>Beyond Divinity</i>, <i>Divinity II</i> features a classless character system, where it is possible for any created character, with the right distribution of experience points, to attain the items and/or abilities needed to triumph in virtually any situation faced. This is by design to add flexibility to gameplay. Players of <i>Divinity II</i> also experience flexibility in the game\'s mix of aerial and ground-based combat. This is rooted in shape-shifting ability that allows players, once the dragon ability is unlocked, and playing in areas physically permissible to the dragon form, to switch between human and dragon forms at will. Beyond the obvious increase in power, playing as a dragon also allows for special skills and abilities not available to humans, as well as allows you to travel faster and longer distances than possible in your human form. Be warned though, you are also much more visible to enemies. Another pivotal element of gameplay is the Battle Tower. Battle Towers are central structures to which you can teleport at all times &#151; once a tower is yours, that is &#151; using a mystical device called the Dragon Stone. More than that, your tower houses multiple rooms and terraces where different attendants provide a variety of services. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Sequel to an Award-Winning RPG Series</b> - Following the lineage of <i>Divine Divinity</i> and <i>Beyond Divinity</i>, <i>Divinity II: Ego Draconis</i> has adapted many of the most famous elements that made these two original games classics. <i>Divinity II: Ego Draconis</i> makes use of the same classless system that was incorporated in <i>Divine Divinity</i>, which allows you to choose your own path as you become a Dragon Knight.</li> <li><b>Fight as Both a Human and a Dragon</b> - Don\'t settle for taming and riding a dragon when you can be the Dragon. For the first time, an RPG unleashes the very power of the Dragon on you. Climb high and vaporize all that stands in your way as you strategically use both your human and dragon forms to defeat Damian and become the ultimate Dragon Knight.</li> <li><b>Dynamic Choice-Based Storyline</b> - <i>Divinity II : Ego Draconis</i> gives you a wide range of moral choices when deciding on how to act on quest objectives. When you make these choices, the consequences of your actions appear throughout game play. Consequences such as up to 20 possible quest solutions, new quest chains, NPC reactions, vendor pricing and other experience-altering consequences make <i>Divinity II: Ego Draconis</i> very interesting and engaging.</li> <li><b>Powerful Battle Tower Gameplay Element</b> - Looming like a colossal stone claw over Sentinel Island, stands the Battle Tower, a vast citadel built many centuries ago by Maxos, the Dragon Mage. Become bound to the Battle Tower through a mystical relic known as the Dragon Stone. The Dragon Stone allows you to teleport to the Battle Tower at any moment so that you can utilize the powers within.</li> <li><b>Build Your Own Ultimate Fighting Creature</b> - Conjure the spirits to bring to life a creature made from body parts you have collected during your battles. This creature\'s power is literally the sum of its body parts; the composition of various limbs determines its strengths and abilities. Once you are able to assemble this abomination, you may summon it to support you in combat.</li> <li><b>First Appearance on Xbox 360</b> - <i>Divinity II: Ego Draconis</i> marks the initial release of the <i>Divinity</i> franchise for play on Xbox 360 or any other gaming console.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Reported nearly two-hundred years earlier in a document penned by a Portuguese explorer, the lost City of Z, the suspected hub of an as of yet undiscovered large-scale civilization in what was assumed to always have been the sparsely populated inner Amazon region, was Fawcett\'s passion and obsession. His adventures and disappearance became the stuff of legend, inspiring everything from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s novel <i>The Lost World</i>, to early Hollywood movies and in part, even the iconic adventures and person of Indiana Jones. <p/> <b>Story and Gameplay</b><br/> The historical Colonel Fawcett was quite aware of the dangers of his adventures, including disease, wild animals and the possibly fatal consequences of trespassing in the lands of native tribes. He even went so far as to request that no rescue party be sent if he did not return. In real-life this was ignored, and scores of people were lost over the years searching for Colonel Fawcett and/or the truth behind the legendary City of Z. The storyline of <i>Nat Geo Adventure: Lost City of Z</i> features the fictional account of one of these later expeditions, in this case lead by a modern National Geographic employee. Reported missing in the jungle for four days, it&rsquo;s up to you to help find your National Geographic comrade and the truth behind the real Lost City of Z. To do so players use the game\'s point-and-click interaction mechanism to collect clues and hidden items found throughout the game environment, read maps and solve puzzles. In addition, players will engage in five mini-games and use their in-game camera and journal to document the wildlife, environments, artifacts and ruins that are encountered as they creep ever closer to finally solving the mystery of the <i>Lost City of Z</i>. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Follow the clues left by Colonel Fawcett to lead you through the mysterious rainforest.</li> <li>Play 5 exciting new mini-games to challenge clue solving skills.</li> <li>Watch thrilling footage from the National Geographic chronicle of the Lost City of Z as seen on TV.</li> <li>Take photographs of the beautiful scenes and wildlife around you and catalog them in your daily journal.</li> <li>Single player, hidden object mystery, point-and-click adventure.</li> <li>Educational and entertaining content and gameplay suitable for all ages.</li> </ul> <h4>System Requirements</h4> <table border=1 cellpadding=""3""> <tr> <td width=""29%""></td> <td align=center width=""71%""> <b>Minimum</b></td> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""29%"">OS:</td> <td align=center width=""71%"">Windows XP, Vista</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""29%"">Processor:</td> <td align=center width=""71%"">Pentium 800 MHz or faster processor</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=""29%"">RAM:</td> <td align=center width=""71%"">512MB or more</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=""29%"">Disc Drive:</td> <td colspan=2 align=center width=""71%"">2x or faster CD/DVD-ROM drive</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""29%"">Hard Drive:</td> <td colspan=""2"" align=center width=""71%"">159MB or more</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""29%"">DirectX:</td> <td align=center width=""71%"">DirectX 8.0 compatibility</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""29%"" height=""26"">Input Device:</td> <td td colspan=""2"" align=center width=""71%"">Mouse and keyboard</td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

To escape these rooms players use the DS stylus or their finger to click on the blank areas next to the section of the room that your character is in. This shifts your character to that section. But think ahead and plan accordingly to avoid problem areas or circumstance that may block your path. In addition to spatially oriented thinking, special items can also help you through your journey. For instance, use a ladder to climb vertically to a new room section, or teleport to entirely new areas or rooms via one of the mysterious telephones available throughout the game. These items and more can be found at various spots in the play area, or in the central area connecting rooms, know as ""Rooms Street."" Here you can also interact with non-player characters and get a better understanding of how this jumbled world came to be. <p/> <b>Share Your Rooms</b><br/> Nintendo DS/DSi players of <i>Rooms: The Main Building</i> can not only create their own game levels, but also share their creations via a Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.

Wii</i>, like all the previous releases in the <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip down <i>Mario Bros.</i> memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote, <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> manages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer. <p/> <b>A Franchise First: Simultaneous Multiplayer</b><br/> Since the very first <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous \'player 2.\' Those days are no more. In <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> players can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-paced <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> fun. <p/> <b>Controller Choices Via the Wii Remote</b><br/> In another nod to the series\' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used with <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> is held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which is <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i>. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> offers a combination of cooperation and competition. Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.</li> <li>Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.</li> <li>Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.</li> <li>In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.</li> <li>New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.</li> <li>At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> An space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay in <i>Mass Effect 2</i> revolves around the player\'s particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background. <p/> Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance in <i>Mass Effect 2</i>, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs. <p/> <b>Integration with the Original <i>Mass Effect</i></b><br/> <i>Mass Effect 2</i> allows players of the original <i>Mass Effect</i> game to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return, as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time in <i>Mass Effect 2</i> will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Futuristic Weapons</b> - Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.</li> <li><b>Elite Specialists</b> - Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy\'s most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

New players will find a thrilling stand-alone adventure awaits them, a polished and action packed journey that surpasses the first game in nearly every possible way.</li> <li><b>Intense Third-Person Combat</b> - Increased intensity with precision shooter controls to let you control the action and overcome insurmountable odds.</li> <li><b>New Damage System</b> - New location based damage system allows for targeting of key weak points, blasting off limbs, igniting enemies, or crippling and disabling enemy troops.</li> <li><b>Character Customization</b> - Choose a player class, customize your appearance, and tailor your own abilities and strengths.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background. <p/> Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance in <i>Mass Effect 2</i>, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs. <p/> <b>Integration with the Original <i>Mass Effect</i></b><br/> <i>Mass Effect 2</i> allows players of the original <i>Mass Effect</i> game to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return, as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time in <i>Mass Effect 2</i> will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Futuristic Weapons</b> - Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.</li> <li><b>Elite Specialists</b> - Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy\'s most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission. Train and equip your team to survive insurmountable odds.</li> <li><b>Explore the Galaxy</b> - Scan planets to uncover unique secret missions in the <i>Mass Effect</i> universe.</li> <li><b>Integration with Original <i>Mass Effect</i></b> - Players of the first <i>Mass Effect</i> can import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. New players will find a thrilling stand-alone adventure awaits them, a polished and action packed journey that surpasses the first game in nearly every possible way.</li> <li><b>Intense Third-Person Combat</b> - Increased intensity with precision shooter controls to let you control the action and overcome insurmountable odds.</li> <li><b>New Damage System</b> - New location based damage system allows for targeting of key weak points, blasting off limbs, igniting enemies, or crippling and disabling enemy troops.</li> <li><b>Character Customization</b> - Choose a player class, customize your appearance, and tailor your own abilities and strengths. As you progress, so do Shepard&rsquo;s abilities.</li> <li><b>Improved Dialogue Mechanic</b> - Improved NPC conversation system where Commander Shepard can take matters into your own hands &ndash; interrupting or using force to get the answer required.</li> </ul> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""10"" width=""625""> <tr> <td valign=""top""> <div align=""center""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.ce.jpg"" width=""82"" height=""160""></div> </td> <td valign=""middle""><font size=""+1""><i>Mass Effect 2</i> Collector\'s Edition for PC Includes:</font> <ul> <li><i>Mass Effect 2</i> software</li> <li>48-page hardcover art book</li> <li>Limited edition Mass Effect Redemption #1 comic book</li> <li>Exclusive in-game Collectors&rsquo; Edition weapon and armor</li> <li>Bonus DVD with behind-the-scenes and making-of videos</li> <li>Limited edition Cerberus Network card granting access to bonus content</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <h4>System Requirements:</h4> <table border=1 cellpadding=""3""> <tr> <td width=""11%""></td> <td align=center width=""44%""> <b>Minimum Specifications:</b></td> <td align=center width=""45%""><b>Recommended Specifications:</b></td> <tr> <td width=""11%"">OS:</td> <td colspan=""2"" align=center>Windows XP or Vista.</td> </tr><tr valign=""top""> <td width=""11%"">Processor:</td> <td align=center width=""44%"">2.4+ GHz Intel or 2.0+ GHz AMD</td> <td align=center width=""45%"">2.6+ GHz Intel or 2.4+ GHZ AMD</td> </tr><tr> <td width=""11%"">RAM:</td> <td align=center width=""44%"">1GB+ (XP), 2GB+ (Vista)</td> <td align=center width=""45%"">2GB+</td> </tr><tr> <td width=""11%"">Disc Drive:</td> <td colspan=2 align=center>8x DVD-ROM drive or better</td> </tr><tr valign=""top""> <td width=""11%"">Hard Drive:</td> <td colspan=""2"" align=center>12GB or more</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""11%"">Video Card:</td> <td align=center width=""44%"">NVIDIA GeForce 6 series (6800GT or better), ATI 1300XT or better (X1550, X1600 Pro and HD2400 are below minimum system requirements)</td> <td align=center width=""45%"">NVIDIA GeForce 7900 GTX or higher.

As with the original <i>UFC 2009 Undisputed</i> game, action plays out in one-on-one fights in which the player, utilizes a mix of fighting styles which are balanced between striking techniques&#151;a standing game&#151;and grappling techniques&#151;a ground game. Because the strength, experience and fighting style of opponents will vary, it is important to develop both a standing and ground game in order to defeat opponents by knockout, submission or by a decision depending on an opponent\'s weakness and/or the opportunities encountered during a match. The game features representations of more than 100 top name UFC fighters, each of which utilizes fighting styles representative of the actual fighter. Along with this realism, the game contains customization options that allow the player to create a fighter of their own with various styles, and/or attire and tattoos. Additional features new to <i>UFC Undisputed 2010</i> include: the addition of Sambo, Karate and Greco-Roman Wrestling fighting styles; the ability to switch to a southpaw stance at any time; new strikes, submissions, transitions; the ability to change submissions mid-attack; an enhanced Career Mode; and improved online play allowing for 16-player tournaments, online fight camps, co-op sparring and more. <p/> <b>Ultimate Fights Mode</b><br/> Ultimate Fights Mode is the evolution of <i>UFC 2009</i>\'s Classic Fights Mode allowing players to relive some of the more memorable fights in UFC history. Players can play the mode as a single player experience in an attempt to unlock content associated with each fight or play as a two-player experience, squaring off against friends with special presentation and commentary elements. The main difference between Classic Fights from <i>UFC 2009</i> and the Ultimate Fights for <i>UFC Undisputed 2010</i> is the introduction of Fight Categories and Multiple Challenges for each fight. Assigning each fight to a category helps structure the mode and allows players to easily identify each type of fight, while the introduction of Multiple Challenges for each fight adds replayability to the mode. You may also ""play as the spoiler"" and provide additional challenges and unlocks associated with the losing fighter, where players look to ""rewrite history."" <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>UFC Fighters and Personalities</b> - Navigate an unparalleled roster of more than 100 prolific UFC fighters, each fully rendered to convey a photorealistic appearance.

Legend says that slaying the Archdemon would have put an end to the darkspawn threat for centuries to come, but for all the Grey Wardens\' vigilance, somehow the creatures remain. But there is a new spark of hope. You are the Grey Warden Commander and have been entrusted with the duty of rebuilding the order of Grey Wardens and uncovering the secrets of the darkspawn and how they managed to remain. How you choose to rebuild your order, how you resolve the conflict with ""The Architect"", and how you determine the fate of the darkspawn will be but some of the many complex choices that await and shape your journey as you venture to the new land of Amaranthine. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> As with the original <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i> game, the <i>Awakening</i> expansion is a single player RPG in which the path of a player\'s created hero is determined through a combination of ongoing actions throughout the game and the character\'s particular backstory, known as an Origin Story. Origin Stories relate primarily to the combination of the chosen race of the character and that individual\'s socioeconomic status. For example, a player who favors a Dwarfish character may have a variety of options, including the choice of being a commoner or a noble. As the character progresses through the game he will interact with any number of non-player characters (NPCs) who may have a particular opinion of Dwarves which may or may not be altered by the fact that the character is of noble or commoner status. These built-in impressions, blended in real-time with the character\'s interactions and choices alter the hero\'s personal path and eventually the outcome of the events of the game. <i>Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening</i> is a standalone expansion, meaning that ownership of the original <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i> game is not necessary for play. That said, players of the previous game are afforded the added benefit of importing their character from the original game to continue that adventure, or beginning anew with a new character and Origin Story. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>A Stunning World Expanded</b> - BioWare&rsquo;s deepest universe to date just got bigger with an all new area of the world to explore, Amaranthine.</li> <ul> <li>Unlock the secrets of the Darkspawn and their true motivations.</li> <li>Rebuild the Grey Warden order and establish their base of operations at Vigil&rsquo;s Keep.</li> </ul> <li><b>All-new Complex Moral Choices</b> - Embark on an epic story that is completely defined and reactive to your play style, allowing players to create an entire experience based on both overall choices made and how complex situations are handled.</li> <li><b>The Varying Influence of ""Origin Story""</b> - Begin your character\'s adventure with a specific socioeconomic Origin Story that will affect attitudes and exchanges with NPCs, creating the possibility of a wide variety of game endings and thus add to the game\'s replay value.</li> <li><b>New Ways to Customize Your Hero</b> - Experience additional spells, abilities, specializations, and items to further personalize and customize your hero and party.</li> <ul> <li>Import your character from <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i> or start anew as a Grey Warden from the neighboring land of Orlais.</li> <li>Encounter five all-new party members and an old favorite from <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i>.</li> </ul> <li><b>Even more Bone-crushing, Visceral Combat</b> - Test your skills against an evolved, intelligent breed of Darkspawn and other menacing creatures including the Inferno Golem, \'Queen of the Blackmarsh\' - deadly Spectral Dragon and The Children, a hideous and huge arachnid like scourge.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

This brave young girl, Suzuhime, matures to become a warrior representing both East and West. The insidious Golba, a veteran of the U.S. Revolutionary War, ranks paramount among her foes, and a cadre of like-minded fighters flock to Japan to halt his dark plans for global domination. Familiar faces from past Samurai Shodown games (including Haohmaru, Nakoruru, and Ukyo) battle alongside newcomers from all corners of the Earth to put an end to Golba's villainous designs. Victory on this crucial conflict comes by any means necessary even if it means ending a melee with grisly dismemberment or decapitations. Celebrate the 17th anniversary of SNK Playmore's revered weapons-based fighting franchise with the most brutal and visceral Samurai Shodown installment ever produced - Samurai Shodown Sen. Set in 1791 during the twilight days of Japan's feudal Edo period, this latest iteration reveals a society on the brink of collapse, as encroaching Western influences threaten to overrun the ancient, once-hidden culture of lords, serfs, and samurai. Impressive 3D visuals, huge roster of new and returning fighters, brutal finishing moves and online play and leaderboards via Xbox Live complete the series' much-anticipated rebirth on a next-gen platform.""]","by

This case is great for children and adults who want to add cheerfulness and protection to their portable gaming experience.']","by

If you are looking for traditional arcade-like action, enjoy endless karting fun in Pure Race Mode, but winning the race is only half of the fun. Players looking for a more full <i>ModNation Racers</i> experience can use combat-like racing strategies to attack other karts with an array of dramatic weapons. <p/> <table align=right width=200 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td valign=""top"" height=""353""> <div align=""center""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B003ALEWKU.01.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=344,height=582\'); return false;""><img alt=""Racer trying to outrun a missle in ModNation Racers for PSP"" title=""Racer trying to outrun a missle in ModNation Racers for PSP"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B003ALEWKU.01.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""200"" height=""304""></a><br> </div> <center> <span class=""caption"">PSP kart racing fun.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B003ALEWKU.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=344,height=582\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Ultimate Kart Racer Customization on the Go</b><br/> In addition to topnotch kart racing action, <i>ModNation Racers</i> features extreme customization, allowing each player to create their own unique racing experience with the same tools used by the game development team.

Customization of karts is equally deep, allowing for alteration of everything from suspension and interior, to body, wheels, decals. Finally, <i>ModNation Racers</i> gives players everything that they need to build the tracks of their dreams.
