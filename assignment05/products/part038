Jarrett &amp; Labonte Stock Car Racing,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Race a total of 23 racetracks from five continents with <i>Jarrett &amp; Labonte Stock Car Racing</i>. The game comes with 42 licensed cars from companies such as Audi, BMW, and Chrysler. Players can play as either Jason Jarrett or Justin Labonte in the championship mode. With its realistic approach to the physics of driving and impact damage, this game demonstrates that racing can be more than just an arcade game. Full driver assistance is available--recommended car setups, traction control, ABS, and much more. Other features include commentary by Jason Jarrett's paternal grandfather, stock-car racing legend Nat Jarrett, along with music provided by the Offspring, Methods of Mayhem, Radiator, Lit, and Moby."", ""For those familiar with NASCAR, a video game with a title like Jarrett and Labonte Stock Car Racing is sure to spring to mind thoughts of oval racing on a hot summer's day, where Jason Jarrett and Juston Labonte are neck and neck to the finish line of the Daytona 500. This is, however, not the case - in fact, Jarrett and Labonte Stock Car Racing has nothing to do with NASCAR nor with Jason Jarrett and Juston Labonte, but it is nevertheless a rather surprisingly in-depth, realistic racer that video game racing fans should definitely check out.  The game is, in fact, the unofficial third installment to the TOCA series, which, while mildly popular, didn't have enough depth when it was stacked up against the likes of Gran Turismo. This year, however, Jarrett and Labonte Stock Racing has taken the TOCA engine to a whole new level with a tweaked physics model and more features, cars, and tracks than before. In all, the game offers 42 cars, including models from well-known manufacturers such as Ford, Dodge, BMW, Lexus, and Chrysler. You can race across the world on 23 real-world tracks including Laguna Seca, Suzuka, and Hockenhiemring. The tracks have been painstakingly re-created through various methods: The developers took countless photos, tons of video, and even used helicopters and laser scans of each track to ensure that the details of each track in the game were as exact as possible."", ""The gameplay has an ultrarealistic feel to it, thanks to an accurate physics model that not only shows the car lean from the stress of a turn, but also totally lets you stay in control with tight responsive controls. The cars all react realistically to collisions, turns, and even damage. If you slam the front end of your car into a wall or an unfortunate opponent, your bumper is likely to fall off, and if it's a serious collision, you may cause an engine fire. The damage your car takes actually affects how it handles, which means that sometimes your car will pull to the left or right, forcing you to compensate."", ""Visually, Jarrett and Labonte Stock Car Racing is very impressive. One of the best things about the game's graphics is how realistically the cars show the damage that they are dealt. Codemasters used a dynamic polygonal deformation damage system, which appropriately shows damage on the part of the car you collide with. By far, it is the best car damage system we've seen. When you have a bit of trouble with the front of your car, headlights are appropriately knocked out, which makes night races even more fun. The car models, before they get all beat up, are very detailed and extremely realistic looking. You can play the game from a standard chase view or a standard cockpit view, which allows you to see everything you'd see inside of a real stock car, including a working instrument panel. The game even features a Matrix-styled 360-degree freeze-frame camera effect that highlights exciting moments, like collisions during the game's replay of a race. You can find little extras around the track, such as hot air balloons in the sky and other small but interesting elements."", ""In the audio department, Jarrett and Labonte Stock Car Racing is packed with all sorts of goodies. Its soundtrack includes music by Offspring, Methods of Mayhem, Radiator, Lit, and Moby. Ned Jarrett provides the commentary for the game, which is a great addition since he's been doing it for the real sport for more than 30 years now."", ""In the end, Jarrett and Labonte Stock Car Racing is a solid racing game that's great fun for anyone who really enjoys spending a great deal of time learning all the ins and outs of a totally in-depth racing game. It's definitely one of the best PlayStation racing games to come out this year.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Superbike World Championship - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The definitive PC motorcycle racing simulation is here. Race on the edge with the real riders, tracks, and bikes of the SBK Superbike World Championship.', 'You might expect Superbike World Championship to be just another arcade-style racer, a fun and flashy game with very little realism and nothing much in common with the sport it simulates, save the name. Fortunately for motorcycle enthusiasts, Superbike from EA Sports has a lot more going for it than a fancy 3D engine and a thumping soundtrack. Superb gameplay and a substantial dose of simulation-style realism make this one of the best motorcycle games to hit PC screens in quite a while.', ""Superbike offers the same basic gameplay options you'll find in any good racer. Both single races and championship seasons are available, and you have the choice of either action or simulation mode for each. Six additional game options (difficulty, weather conditions, and so on) let you tailor each race to your tastes and skill level. If you choose simulation mode, you can also adjust nine realism settings, including the use of real Superbike rules, computer-assisted acceleration, braking, and the occurrence of engine failures."", ""The game includes 12 Superbike tracks, including Phillip Island, Monza, and Laguna Seca. Each is well rendered with plenty of detail to create a reasonably realistic racing environment. Just about every track has at least one particularly memorable bend, twist, or curve - Laguna Seca's trademark corkscrew turn, for example."", ""There are five bikes to choose from: Ducati 916, Honda RC 45, Kawasaki ZX7R, Yamaha YZF, and Suzuki GSXR. Each is evenly matched but offers a slight variation in instrumentation, engine noise, and color scheme (for the aesthetically minded gamers among you). In simulation mode, you can modify your bike's chassis (rake and trail), transmission (gearbox sprocket, rear-wheel sprocket, gear ratios), suspension, and tires for optimum performance. There's even a nifty telemetry analysis tool that lets you see how your bike performed in a particular race, so you can make the necessary adjustments. As with most racing games that let you modify your vehicle's setup, it's best to leave things alone unless you know what you're doing."", ""Action-mode races and championships are fairly straightforward: You pick your bike (and your track, for single races), select automatic or manual transmission, and then hit the track. Simulation mode gives you more options but also ups the challenge level quite a bit. Single races involve an entire racing weekend, including practice, two rounds of qualification, and two official races. It seemed odd that no overall winner was crowned after the second race, but that's the way the Superbike Association does things, apparently."", ""Gameplay itself can be quite challenging, especially if you've let your reflexes and driving skills go to mush with pure arcade racers like Moto Racer 2 or Redline Racer. Superbike has more in common with UbiSoft's F1 Racing Simulation and Papyrus' Grand Prix Legends than with the arcade crowd, so be prepared to crash (and lose) often in the early going. Thankfully, the game lets you practice at your own pace and also lets you scale the difficulty to fit just about any level of driving skill. Another bonus: Even if you do wipe out a lot, Superbike offers some spectacular crash animations, as your bike skips along the ground with sparks flying, and your driver tumbles along behind. You can even choose to walk your bike back onto the course manually if you want (the default setting just plops you back on your bike at the point of the crash)."", ""Unlike arcade racers, where the brakes are optional and you can bump and smash your way to victory, Superbike is all about finesse and control. Most of the tracks are very curvy, so you must slow down to take the turns - on the best possible line - to move ahead of the pack. Unfortunately - and this is one of the game's notable flaws - the AI is not all that great, and computer-controlled drivers will not always pose much of a challenge. They tend to follow the track well enough and will certainly take advantage of any mistakes you make, but your biggest foe is the track itself. If you crash a lot, you'll lose. If you stay on your bike and on the best possible line around the track, you'll win. In fact, if you manage to get the pole position during a championship season, you have to really screw up horribly to lose the race."", 'Graphically, Superbike is stunning. The tracks, bikes, and riders all look great, and even the distance rendering is pretty good. Fantastic animations for crashes, turns, and angry fist shaking (when another bike bumps you) make the game very lifelike. A decent array of sound effects helps also, though the engine sounds can become annoying after a while. It was pretty cool to hear the crowds cheering when I passed the grandstand, however.', 'I did encounter one weird graphics problem with Superbike: The interface graphics shimmered a bit when I loaded the game using a pair of Voodoo2 cards as my primary 3D device. And occasionally, the game would quit abruptly, claiming a DirectDraw error. When I switched to my Riva TNT board, everything worked fine.', 'Despite the minor graphical glitch, however, Superbike is one impressive game. It may not be the most realistic racing game ever created, but it certainly raises the bar for PC motorcycle racers. <i>--Michael E. Ryan</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Silent Bomber,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""What happens when you take Metal Gear Solid, Bomberman, Trap Gunner, and Soukyugurentai and lock them in a room with a bottle of wine and three loaves of bread? In about nine months you get Silent Bomber, an unnaturally kick-ass action game from the unlikeliest of sources - Bandai, a company better known for churning out Gundam game after Gundam game. Silent Bomber, simply put, is one of the most visceral, fast-paced, playable PlayStation games to arrive in the fading days of the 32-bit system. In Silent Bomber, you assume the role of Jutah (pronounced Utah) Fate, a nondescript man who must save the world from... some sort of... evil or something. The storyline is little more than a catalyst for you to embark on one of the coolest games to arrive on the PlayStation in some time.  Amazingly, the premise is simpler than the storyline. Throughout a well-balanced series of levels, you must navigate Jutah through hostile territory, bombing the bejesus out of the opposition, who vary in complexity and challenge. For example, while the first few sets of enemies are mindless drones who simply veer around the stage, lobbing shots in your general direction, later enemies deliberately swarm around you, mindful of your positioning, and attack with bombs, guns, and swords. To negotiate with these enemies, you have a number of options available to you. Your first and most basic attack is the standard lock-on bomb. When you press down and hold the attack button, a targeting arc will extend and lock on to whatever enemy happens to be in range. Once locked on, pressing the attack button again will launch a series of bombs and plant them on the enemy. The number of bombs you plant is determined by how many times you press the button and how many bombs you are allowed to carry. The number of bombs you carry is, in turn, determined by how many E-Chips you've found, but more on that later. Once the bombs are planted, you detonate them by pressing the triangle button, and depending on the strength of the opponent, he'll either be destroyed or require repeat attempts. Enemies are not the only object you can blow up either. In each level, there are gun turrets, robot-manufacturing plants, and simple structures, including glass windows, which can be blown up. If you destroy the structures that look almost like trash cans each one will leave behind items for you to collect. Certain structures will leave behind the aforementioned E-Chips, which, when gathered in volume, can be cashed in for power upgrades like increased bomb capacity, increased targeting arc range, and increased defense armor. Other power-ups left behind will give you either one of two health refills or one of three material liquids - gravity, electricity, or napalm. Each of the material liquids is effective in its own way, and they are much more than gratuitously palette-swapped smart bombs. Electricity material will stun and inflict great damage to enemies. Napalm will leave behind a large blanket of fire on the ground that will cause continued damage as long as the enemy remains inside it. Gravity liquid is perhaps the most effective of the three. Not only will it suck your opponents into a vortex, but it will also suck in shots and let you continuously plant regular bombs on your foes while they are trapped in the vortex. These weapons are particularly useful when you reach the boss levels. Varying wildly in challenge and style, each new boss will test your reflexes and resourcefulness. You are also equipped with a couple of other moves to aid you in your quest: a jump, a climbing jump, and a burst drive. The burst drive is essentially a dash, which can be done on the ground or in midair. The jumps are self-explanatory, and they can help you reach hard-to-grab items.  The game isn't short, and it will require plenty of time, lives, and patience to get past the final few hours of gameplay. Cranking the gameplay a few notches above typical is the combo system in Silent Bomber. Later in the game, after you've amassed a larger cache of bombs, you can plant them on multiple enemies at one time. Detonating the bombs all at one time and simultaneously destroying all the enemies will garner more points than if you disposed of them one at a time. Another way to score even more points is to plant all your bombs on one foe, wait until other enemies are within the explosion radius, and set off the bombs. Destroying multiple enemies with one exploding enemy will trigger a combo bonus worth more points. At the end of every level is a Street Fighter-like tally of time and health remaining and combo points accrued, and you'll receive an overall score.  <i>--James Mielke </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Jane's Combat Simulations: F-15 (CD-ROM CLASSICS),,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""The next generation in jet combat from Jane's, with the most realistic graphics, physics, avionics, and gameplay in the sky. All the incredible speed and firepower of the world's deadliest strike fighter is now at your command with <i>F-15</i>. Produced by Andy Hollis (<i>F15 Strike Eagle</i> series, AH-64D Longbow) with cooperation from Jane's top military analysts, <i>F-15</i> is the next-generation jet-combat sim from Jane's Combat Simulations. Presenting the most realistic graphics, physics, avionics, and gameplay ever designed for the PC, <i>F-15</i> delivers the blood-pounding thrill of high-speed air combat--the way it was meant to be. Whether your mission is intercepting bandits or stamping a tank convoy, <i>F-15</i> packs enough punch to handle every situation."", ""The Jane's Combat Simulations line leaps from peak to peak, with nary a bum title in the bunch. ATF, Longbow, Longbow 2, 688, and now F-15 have secured the company a place as the pre-preeminent developer of simulation software. Following hot on the heels of Longbow 2, F-15 is, if possible, an even more impressive piece of work. By taking on the sadly neglected F-15E Strike Eagle, it fills a crucial gap in the air combat realm."", ""The last true Strike Eagle sim was F-15 Strike Eagle III from MicroProse, also produced by Andy Hollis. That it has taken five years to create another, while we are flooded with Tomcat, F-22, and Falcon sims, is a mystery. The F-15E is an extraordinary, versatile aircraft. It seats two (pilot and weapon systems officer), carries a heavy payload, and is designed to penetrate deep into enemy territory at low altitudes. In many ways, it's not as sexy as a conventional air superiority fighter, since it engages aircraft from beyond visual range. (That is, if it hopes to survive.) With a full payload it can be sluggish, but shorn of the extra weight it can hold its own in a close-in dogfight. Its mission is to deliver precision munitions to ground targets and protect itself while doing so, and F-15 captures these roles admirably."", 'The first thing that strikes you about F-15 is the amazing attention to detail in the cockpit. On full realism mode, the array of sensors and controls is awe-inspiring in its accuracy. Since the F-15 relies so heavily on these sensors, they are the heart of the game. Their complexity can be reduced to ease gamers into the sim, but that misses most of the point. The multifunction displays for both front and back seats may be custom configured for air-to-ground, air-to-air, and navigation modes, placing five MFDs at your fingertips at any given moment. There are hundreds of potential commands and combinations, which makes the custom keyboard mapping a welcome and essential feature.', ""Full virtual cockpit look-around views and padlock mode are effectively implemented. This goes hand in glove with an assortment of exterior views that enable you to track pretty much everything going on. The flight model adheres to the most rigorous standards of accuracy. It has a terrific feel for weight and motion, and the variations in handling characteristics are spot on. If a flight model can get better than this, I wouldn't be able to tell. Artificial intelligence is strong in both friendly and enemy aircraft, and the laundry list of nested wingman commands lets you issue any order you may need to, to the entire flight or an individual plane. And these wingmen won't run into you."", ""There are myriad ways into missions. The numerous training missions aren't as effective as the Longbow tutorial, but they get the job done. Single missions allow you to hone various skills, and instant-action settings provide basic custom missions. The powerful mission editor puts every element of the game into your hands, enabling you to craft complex missions through placement of assets, waypoints, and event triggers. Finally, the two campaigns (Iran and Iraq) get you to the heart of the sim. The dynamic campaign system keeps missions constantly fresh and diverse and gives the battlefield itself a realistic, alive feel."", ""There are some mild disappointments. Multiplayer support for two to eight gamers is stable, but fails to allow for co-op missions, reducing head-to-head to fur balls. This is silly for an F-15 game. One sadly missed feature is an in-flight recorder for mission playback. Visually, the game is striking, but even with a 3D card, full detail requires a Pentium 300 and 32MB of RAM. Other games achieve similar, and in some cases better, results with less hardware. And, even with a huge manual, numerous difficulty settings, and an extensive tutorial, you'll need some serious chops to fly this sucker. Even on easy levels, it is very instrument intensive, and the learning curve is steep. The payoff, however, is a superb, thorough, and vastly entertaining combat sim. <i>--Chet Thomas</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the lack of depth and originality here is ultimately  disappointing. <i>--T. Byrl Baker</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Good graphics <li>Enormous, detailed enemies  <li>Very little slowdown  </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Too easy  <li>Too short <li>Little variety and few secrets </ul>', ""Vanark is a 3D shooter that successfully blends many different elements from many different games, including Star Fox 64 and even Resident Evil. While this sounds like a surefire formula for a terrific game, Vanark simply doesn't offer enough to make it worthwhile.  Compared with other 3D space shooters like Star Fox, Vanark is stereotypical. You pilot a ship on a mission to save the planet, and you see all of the action from a camera angle positioned behind the ship. The ship is on a predetermined course (also known as a rail shooter), which only leaves you the ability to speed up, slow down, evade, and return enemy fire.  The gameplay is extremely fast paced, thanks to the incredible number of enemies that get thrown your way. When you're not blasting at a volley of biomech dragonflies or some other exotic creation, you're either carefully navigating through a narrow passage or just trying to stay clear of enemy fire, which, thanks to responsive controls and intuitive control scheme, is easy to do.  The elements of Vanark that stand out are its branching paths, multiple vehicle types, and third-person mode. The branching paths let you determine at specific points the direction you'd like your ship to head in. This direction, while ultimately leading to the same place, puts you on one of two paths - one's easy, and the other is a lot harder. While you may be given this choice to make on some levels, others literally force you to take alternate paths and or other vehicles. One such level takes place over an ocean where, when the action gets a little too hot, you're forced to dive-bomb your ship into the depths of the ocean where you'll find giant biomechanical sharks to deal with. Another level puts you in control of a futuristic motorcycle of sorts, which you must drive across a desert that is barren of everything but enemies and hazards. The third-person mode in Vanark, while slightly interesting at first, proves to be terribly boring and uneventful by the end of the game. This mode takes place between each of the seven shooting levels of the game, and it can best be described as a Resident Evil-style mode. During this mode you have free reign to explore the limited quarters of the space station, but all that you ever really discover are mission briefings and story developments. This mode almost seems as though it was simply thrown into the game to give it a bit more length.   Visually, Vanark is quite impressive. The game's environments range from lush jungles filled with enemies and intricate backgrounds with lots of eye candy, to underground caves that are brimming with spectacular rivers of lava. More impressive-looking than the levels are the bosses that you come across at the end of every mission. The bosses are throwbacks to the days of old in that every one of them is a menacing giant creature or contraption of some sort that looks fantastic as well as unbeatable. For instance, one of the bosses in the later missions is a giant brain that sends out pulses of electricity, which gives off a dynamic lighting effect that looks quite spectacular. In the sound department, Vanark does a fairly good job. The engines of the various crafts you pilot sound convincing, as do the many types of futuristic weapons you use and avoid. The soundtrack isn't overly impressive, but it does suit the game quite well. In the end, Vanark is a really good game. Unfortunately, it's a really good game that lasts for two to three hours, and it doesn't offer anything other than a level-selection option after completing it. So while you might really enjoy playing this game, you might be best served by renting it for a night.   <I>--Ryan Mac Donald </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Star Wars Episode 1 Racer,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"['At last! The first <i>Star Wars</i> game for the 128-bit Dreamcast lets  you participate in the famous podrace sequence (which was the critical highlight  of the 1999 film <i>Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace</i>). These  lightning-quick vehicles are capable of reaching simulated speeds of up to 600  miles per hour, while skimming a mere 4 feet above the ground. You can race  alone or against a friend in split-screen mode, on over more than 21 courses  among eight worlds. Take the controls as Jedi-to-be Anakin Skywalker, or any one  of over 20 podracers, and feel the full-force blast--while avoiding hazards such  as methane lakes, meteor showers, and the unfriendly Tusken Raiders.', 'Adapting and expanding on the most intense scene of what\'s arguably the biggest film of the decade creates some big shoes for a game to fill, eh? If that draws a completely blank stare from you, know that the premise of Star Wars: Episode I Racer is this: You\'ve entered the podrace, a tournament that is much like the Ben Hur chariot race meets... Star Wars. In Racer, each contestant drives a vehicle made of a small cockpit that\'s literally dragged behind two or more huge starship engines. These vehicles speed upward of six hundred miles per hour and never go much higher than a few feet off of the ground.  When the LucasArts developers first read the film\'s script, the podrace scene must have been the unanimous choice to adapt for the introductory game of the ""new franchise,"" and of course much has been added to the ten-minute scene. Instead of simply racing the course on the desert world of Tatooine, you have seven additional planets and more than twenty tracks in all to race, as well as more than twenty pilots besides young Anakin Skywalker to race as. The gameplay is much like that of other futuristic-style racing games out there (yes, I know it\'s set in a time ""long, long ago,"" but bear with me), such as Psygnosis\' Wipeout XL and Nintendo\'s F-Zero X, except that in this game there are no power-ups to acquire, and you can\'t use offensive weapons against your opponents, at least until you unlock the main boss as a playable character. You compete in a series of tournaments made up of four or more races each. If you place fourth or better, you can continue to the next race and earn money to buy upgrades to your podracer, and you\'ll need these upgrades to hold your own against the increasingly tough AI opponents.  The main feature that Racer offers over its competition is a feeling of speed beyond any of the few games that actually meet its frame rate. You\'ll come upon obstacles such as boulders or large spacecraft so quickly that you\'ll be gasping at your skill or luck when you manage to avoid them. But what makes the speed fun is its combination of a fantastic physics engine and great controls. You use the analog pad to steer your ship - the A button acts as the gas, the B is the brake, the right trigger creates a powerslide, and the left trigger deploys the repair droids to fix damage. Incidentally, this button slows you down when in use. Leaning completely forward on the analog pad will build up a turbo boost, which is offset by the fact that leaning back and side-to-side will give you tighter turns. It\'s a simple and elegant setup, really. Racer\'s graphics are where things fall apart a bit. They look exactly like the graphics in the PC version of the game, granting this version a few eye-candy effects over the N64 edition but none of the shading effects that gave the illusion of greater speeds. The world has a flat, metallic look to it, as in its PC brother. That said, the environments are increasingly impressive and well designed. The Oovo IV and the later Mon Gazza tracks are at times so stunning that they\'ll invariably make you crash because you\'ll look away from the course for a moment to take them in. Pop-up, which occurs from time to time, won\'t necessarily make you wipe out, but due to the stress of the game\'s high speed, you\'ll want to see as far ahead as you can. The pop-up is not much worse in the two-player split-screen race (as it often is in other games), and the frame rate is still good. Meanwhile, the sound effects in the game are good, but the comments from the racers are very dull and repetitive. What was impressive on the N64 is far less here, because the GD-ROM format allows for so much more than a cartridge.  Also worth noting is that the game starts off very easy and then suddenly gets extremely challenging, to the point where you\'ll want to set the prize money to ""winner takes all"" and restart the races until you master them completely. Without the vehicle upgrades that extra cash brings, you\'ll be left hopeless in the dust by the other drivers. Sound kind of underhanded? Well, since you can\'t go back to try to do better in completed races, it\'s the only way to succeed. ""Cheating"" or no, the game could use a few more tracks or a mirror-mode tournament to stretch it out a bit more. One nice feature that adds to its value though is the addition of up to four computer-controlled opponents in the multiplayer mode. If they\'re set to normal or easy AI, you\'ll likely not see them very often or at all, but on hard AI, they\'re great to play against.  Racer is an incredibly fast, superfun game to play once you get a few levels into it. While it may be true that it doesn\'t come close to tapping the graphic and audio capabilities of the system and that it\'s release comes far later than it should have, the gameplay is still very solid, and it fills the futuristic racing niche for the Dreamcast nicely.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Hot Shots Golf successfully united both factions, giving sim fans the realistic golfing engine they desired but tossing in enough spice and simplicity to hold the interest of arcade fans. As the first game to follow in Hot Shot's footsteps, Hot Shots Golf 2 has some big shoes to fill. But not only does it fill those shoes, it also stretches them a little - as Hot Shots Golf 2 is more than a worthy successor to the original. From the get go, Hot Shots Golf 2 is easy to get into. You can simply launch yourself into a game, or you can explore the various menus, and you can even learn everything there is to know about the game with its detailed tutorial section. Once you feel like you've mastered the concepts of golfing Hot Shots style, you can choose one of six different games. There's a simple four-player stroke game, a par three nine-hole game, a two-player match play, and one-player tournament, training, and vs. modes. Beating the tournament mode unlocks new courses for you to play on, while the vs. mode lets you challenge one of the ten hidden characters to an 18-hole course of your choice. If you win the match, you'll unlock that character for play in all the other modes. Each character has his own strengths and weaknesses - from ball control to arc type - making a sizable difference between players' game styles. Like Hot Shots Golf, HSG2 uses an experience-points system - you gain a certain amount of points by playing in any game mode besides training. You can spend these points on unlocking various things in the game - from better equipment to secret modes. The gameplay is where Hot Shots Golf 2 really shines. Simply put, the golfing is spot-on. Everything that you would expect from a realistic golfing sim is here. Wind changes, ball spin, and the lie of your ball are all things to keep an eye on when planning your shot. When you can't read the wind by watching the clouds, you can toss up grass to help you judge from which direction and how hard the wind is blowing. Hot Shots Golf 2 lets you easily switch cameras, and it instantly lets you view the course from almost any camera angle - using a simple zoom-and-pan system that's incredibly easy to master. On top of that, with a single button press you can change to a bird's-eye view of the hole, letting you plan not only that one shot, but also a series of shots with ease. Hot Shots Golf 2 brings back the classic power/accuracy meter for hitting the ball - press the x button to start the meter, again to set the stroke's power, and once again to set the stroke's accuracy. While this tried-and-true method works well, it would have been nice to see HSG2 implement an analog-control scheme - similar to that in Tiger Woods 2000 - to let you choose the scheme you are most comfortable with. Additionally, you can set your ball spin while the power/accuracy meter is in motion, allowing more advanced players to do cool things like slice the ball around obstacles or land the ball softly once it hits the green. Now, the game automatically switches to an approach mode when you get closer than 60 yards to the hole, and it switches to a superapproach mode when you're closer than 30 yards. These modes help improve accuracy, making it that much easier to sink a chip shot. The graphics in HSG2 are slightly better than those of the original game. The courses are still beautifully laid out, and you can scroll back and forth with no slowdown or polygonal breakup. The camera work is nice, randomly changing to show the track of the ball in flight. This time around, the characters are much different - they have a more claylike look to them than the classic Camelot characters found in the first game. As such, the characters look very much out of place, with ridiculous animation sequences once they actually sink the shot. Not surprisingly, the sound in the game is very nice. Catchy pop tunes fill the audio track, while cool sound effects and ambient noises help you get a real feel for the course. When the wind is blowing particularly hard, you can hear it coming from the appropriate speaker. The only thing that keeps you from feeling like you're actually golfing is your inability to throw your club into a lake when you flub a particularly critical shot. Hot Shots Golf 2 has plenty of options for the single player, and it also excels at being a party game. Playing against the computer is always a mixed bag, as the computer-controlled characters never have a consistent game. It's not uncommon to watch your AI opponent score double and triple bogeys on two to three holes, only to have him suddenly sink a 100-yard shot to get an eagle. This inconsistency is most prevalent in the vs. mode, when you're playing to unlock a hidden character. The computer-controlled character will usually let you get ahead by three or four holes and then suddenly start playing amazingly well. In fact, there was one example where the character played an entire par fivehole in the rough, only to sink a 30-yard chip from a sand trap. You'd think that sort of skill would keep the player on the fairway, but apparently that's not the case. While Hot Shots Golf 2 isn't a huge step up from the original game, it's still a great example of how a sequel should be done - by making small but important revisions to the gameplay without sacrificing the formula that made the first game such a hit. Arcade-style golfing may not be a game that deserves a yearly update like most other sports games, but Hot Shots Golf 2 proves that the genre at least deserves more games like it.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Set around the time of the original <i>Mobile Suit Gundam</i> cartoons, the war-story plot here is from the grunt\'s perspective, with players cast as the leader of a combat unit of Mobile Suits (think giant robots). Gameplay is broken down into missions in which players command their own Mobile Suit as well as issue orders to comrades.', ""Although recent <i>Gundam</i> converts may be less than thrilled with the old-school looks (circa 1978) of the Mobile Suits in <i>Gundam Side Story 0079</i>, the 3-D graphics and animation of the Mobile Suits are incredibly faithful to the cartoons, as are the sound effects. On the other hand, the experience of piloting a Mobile Suit leaves much to be desired, as it's not nearly as graceful as it looks in the cartoons, and feels more like you're piloting a tank. The controls here are oversimplified, and the first-person cockpit-view perspective is about as effective as a peephole in combat situations."", ""While <i>Gundam Side Story 0079</i> is the first <i>Gundam</i> title to be released in the United States, it comes from a line of officially licensed titles that have always had a spotty history, one which this title simply doesn't rise above. <i>--Joe Hon</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Excellent Mobile Suit 3-D graphics and animation <li>Sound effects faithful to the cartoons </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Oversimplified controls; clunky combat <li>Short game length </ul>']","by

A ALL-TIME CLASSIC VIDEO GAME. A MUST BUY.

One day, an evil man broke into the palace and stole one of the three magic jewels. Without the third jewel, the two remaining jewels lost their magic sparkle. The magic spell that sealed the power of Boralis, the most vicious demon in the kingdom, was broken. During the turmoil which followed, the last two jewels were stolen. Boralis cast a special magic on Princess Ann, turning her into three fairies, and hid her somewhere in the kingdom. He then let loose a horde of monsters across the land and became the ruler of the kingdom.\n\nFinally, the young knight Jim stood up and took action to restore peace in the kingdom. He bravely made his way into the wilderness in full armour to fight the monsters...\n\n--From the NES Hydlide instruction manual.']","by

And that's not quite the end. Vampire and the Monster's abilities in the game are the same (though 2-player simultaneous action was an option)--an attack that can extend slightly beyond their bodies with a bit of a blaze, and they can make a double-jump from the height of their jump, something that has since become a common move in many video games. The remaining good monsters from the comics--Werewolf, Vampiress, Golem, Swamp Beast, The Phantom of the Opera, Jotun Troll, Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll, and Mummy--made no appearance whatsoever in the game, although Werewolf did appear on the cover. Warlock and Minotaur were the only two monsters from series 2 to appear in the game. In the comic book, however, Medusa declared that by her count, Vampire's side had a majority, though all the other series 1 monsters were included as enemies in the game. Blemmyes appeared prominently on the cover, and the figure was distributed exclusively with the game, though did not appear in the game itself.

Conflicts take place through banks, city chases, hotels, apartments, ports, luxury liners, trains, subways, warehouses, and more. Levels can be played in any order via the stage selection screen, and after the first part of each stage two selectable paths are offered. A variety of bad guys are armed with axes, knifes, pistols, grenades, machine guns, missile launchers, and more. A boss will mark the end of each stage and include mostly airborne (using jet-propelled packs) enemies who use missile and plasma attacks. By shooting various power-ups, players can acquire new weapons including rifles, automatics, machine guns, magnums, shotguns, and additional lives. Shooting a hostage will result in the player losing a life. Options include difficulty selection, gun looseness, selectable lives from one to nine, continues from infinite to nine, audio modes and tests, controller settings, and light gun calibration.

NFL '97 - Sega Saturn,,['1 - 8 Players!'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Saturn', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Kick off the 1996 NFL season with NFL '97 for your Sega Saturn. As usual, Sega has included full NFL and NFLPA licensing so that all of the real players and team logos can be used. The game also follows the 1996 NFL schedule during season play. Despite all of the licensing, none of the stadiums are exact representations of their real-life counterparts. Though they do feature similarities. For example, if a team plays in a dome in real life then they will play in a dome in NFL '97. Modes of play include Exhibition, Practice and Season. Exhibition is for when you only want to play one game while Practice allows players to run offensive drills. Season is the game's primary mode of play. When selected, users can choose to play a full 16-game season, an 8-game season, 4-game season or begin the playoffs. During a season statistics will be tracked in more than 70 team and player categories. League leaders can be accessed with the push of a button at any time allowing you to see how your players stack up against the rest of the league. Seasons can also be saved after the completion of each game. NFL '97 features 150 offensive and defensive plays for every team. However, you are not limited to just those plays as a play editor is included. From the options menu users can also create their own playbook simply by taking plays from each team. A full team can be created as well. Teams are not created by a create-a-player option though; instead users select players from other teams and place them on their team. Player abilities can vary depending on some of the options selected. One setting, called Human Effect, represents how each player will perform. Placing the Human Effect on normal will base a player's performance on their real-life statistics and abilities. Otherwise, the performance will be due more to the skill level of the user controlling the player.""]","by

It had a unique feature (for the time) of a bar that grows between attacks; the length of the bar determines how much damage Astyanax will do with his next attack. If one attacks rapidly, one's hits will do little damage, much unlike most games where a rapid succession of hits would all be equally damaging.

In addition to these ""conventional"" forms of ordinance, there are also special weapons such as tactical nuclear bombs that will sear any enemy standing in your way. Gameplay takes place either on open terrain or in hive-like tunnel structures created by an enemy.\n\nWithin Machine Head, a whole host of strange enemies await, including insects, zombies, dog-bats, and other strange conglomerations of creatures. In addition to killing enemy hordes, players will have objectives in each mission, such as clearing a path and protecting a train or destroying a certain number of specific items.

Giga Wing,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"['Disc(s) only. Ships in generic case. Disc(s) are professoinally cleaned. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', ""After a painfully long hiatus in production, the shooter has triumphantly returned to the market. Armed with 3D graphics and deeper gameplay, the shooter has once again found its place in the hearts of the masses. Capitalizing on this trend, Capcom has released Gigawing, proving that there's a lot more to a good shooter than a cool design gimmick. Why Capcom USA brought this game to the States is beyond us. One day, the Medallion of Wisdom fell from its shrine in heaven. The power-hungry humans quickly discovered that equipping their planes, trains and other devices with this metal granted them the power of the gods. Naturally, this medal fell into the wrong hands, and it's up to four fighter pilots to wrestle it from those hands and destroy it and all that it begets. To help them, these pilots have a magnificent new power at their beck and call - the Reflect Force. Aptly named, the Reflect Force does just as the name implies - it reflects enemy bullets. While this power can be used as many times as you desire, it takes a short amount of time to recharge between uses. In addition to the Reflect Force, each fighter pilot has his own weapon, ranging in both attack spread and strength, and three screen-clearing bombs. While the Reflect Force is a great concept, the game surrounding it isn't so hot. Gigawing began as a CPS2 arcade game, and the difficulty that stems from these arcade roots is apparent - this game is impossible. That may be a slight overstatement, but mortals should expect to continue a lot. The screen is constantly filled with beams, bullets, and other deadly projectiles. While the whole point of the Reflect Force is to turn this ceaseless barrage to the player's advantage, the Reflect Force's recharge time makes it difficult to use. In fact, you're likely to die many, many times when trying to use it. During the game's latter half you may find yourself dying and continuing only to take advantage of the three bombs that come with every life. This kind of difficulty is not only frustrating but also disheartening. Radiant Silvergun, the de facto standard for quality shooters these days, is the exact opposite: Although that game is difficult, one still felt that the odds weren't impossible, and playing again and again would almost always result in additional progress. When you are dealing with shooters there will always be the question of longevity. Compared with recent offerings, Gigawing is definitely a questionable release. Thanks to the unlimited continues, you may opt to complete the game in your first sitting. A sitting that will last all of 30 minutes. And that's it. Nothing more. Playing with the other three characters adds nothing to the game, really, rather giving players the chance to skip the brief philosophical monologues and play the same levels in a slightly different order. No secrets, no different levels. Not even a worthwhile ending. While Gigawing may have been an impressive feat for the aging CPS2 arcade board, it doesn't stack up on the Dreamcast at all. Sure, the Dreamcast's processing power gives the game silky-smooth dodging mayhem without a hint of slowdown, but that doesn't mean the game is in the least bit attractive. Capcom got where it is today by bringing a high level of polish to the table, something Gigawing developer Takumi can't seem to imitate. The game's graphics are muddy, primitive, and lacking in style. To top it off, the game's effects are nonexistent, animations are brusque, and the color palette is garish and unbalanced. Takumi's audio team is no better than the art team, bringing appropriately mediocre music and sound effects to this entirely stale effort. Why did this game come to the US? If Gigawing were priced to move, the violent lack of quality and longevity could be forgiven to an extent, but it's not. Gigawing was designed with the hardest-core shooter fans in mind, but it's this same audience that's likely to be the most disappointed. <i>--Peter Bartholow</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

Nascar Heat,,[],[],{},"[""NASCAR Heat offers a brutally honest driving experience, but with simplistic damage modeling. That's too bad, because NASCAR Heat clearly had the potential to provide the most lifelike stock-car racing experience available."", ""NASCAR Heat doesn't offer nearly the assortment of drivers that Papyrus' NASCAR Racing 3 offers - only 26 drivers signed on the dotted line to be featured in the game, so when you're facing a 43-car field, you'll see a lot of fictional names at the bottom of the pack. And apparently there was a bit of a problem regarding licensing from sponsors: Rusty Wallace and Dale Earnhardt's cars are emblazoned with their names rather than Miller Lite and Budweiser logos respectively (users have already created accurate cars with the game's built-in paint kit, however). Thankfully, just about every track on the Winston Cup circuit is included in the game - the only omissions are Indianapolis and Pocono. In the game's championship mode, you can take part in every event based on the 2000 NASCAR season save two races at Pocono, the Brickyard 400, and a couple of sprints preceding the Daytona 500."", 'Two features that set NASCAR Heat apart from all other stock-car sims are its ""beat the heat"" and ""race the pro"" modes, and these manage to survive the game\'s totally forgiving damage modeling better than the single race and championship modes. Beat the heat is basically a hands-on tutorial that puts NASCAR novices in the cockpit at crucial points during races so that they can get quick experience in various driving techniques. You can beat the first few sessions easily, but as you move up the ladder, things get considerably tougher - the computer-controlled drivers are very intelligent in these sequences, and they take much more care to avoid taps and bumps and generally go all out to win. The race-the-pro mode challenges you to beat lap times turned in by NASCAR pros who play NASCAR Heat.  It\'s a lot more fun to beat a time set by a real person who\'s played the same game you\'ve played, rather than to simply use the sim to beat a real-life time.', ""Monster Games proved that it could create knockout graphics with Viper Racing, but it's outdone itself with NASCAR Heat. Both the tracks and the cars feature virtually perfect textures and details, including accurate shadows cast by grandstand fences and legible logos on tires. If you slam into a wall, the marks stay there for the duration of the race, as do skid marks on the track. Smoke effects also look great, and the game even simulates the effect of inertia, which you can see when the driver's head - and the camera perspective - is pushed back during acceleration. This truly makes you feel as if you're in the driver's seat, especially since the cockpit dash also looks so realistic."", 'What adds to that sense of realism is the game\'s excellent simulation of how stock cars handle. NASCAR Heat faithfully models downforce, which I learned the hard way after constantly sliding out of turns at Martinsville - something I rarely did in either NASCAR Racing 3 or NASCAR 2000. Furthermore, if you hit the garage and adjust things such as grille tape, wedges, and sway bars, the effects are truly apparent on the track. There\'s a ""normal"" play mode that strips away all this stuff, but expert mode just feels so right that even beginners should opt for it and simply knock down the difficulty setting for the computer drivers. The only problem with the way your car handles is that it seems to be more prone than computer-controlled cars to slide when it\'s tapped by another car. I purposely nosed into Bobby Labonte\'s car as we raced side by side, and it took ten seconds or so to finally force him off his line.', ""Unfortunately, NASCAR Heat really falls flat when it comes to simulating car damage, caution flags, and a few other key areas. The developers clearly wanted to make the game appealing to new players by toning down the damage model, but they toned it down far too much. It's bad enough that no attempt was made to depict smashed hoods and crumpled fenders, but it gets worse: You can actually slide down the track with the underside of your car scraping against a wall and then right yourself and continue on your merry way as if nothing happened. About the only area that's realistic is engine damage from overrevving - I blew the engine a couple of times after some injudicious gearbox-tweaking in the garage. But aside from that, about the only way you'll wind up not finishing a race is to turn around and hit someone head-on at 175 m.p.h. - and even that's not a sure thing."", ""Furthermore, though you can expect to spin out and wreck in your first few outings in expert mode until you get a feel for how the cars respond, don't get overly concerned about seeing a lot of yellow flags - it takes a real smash-up to bring one out. Again, this is clearly intended to let players keep on racing without enduring constant yellows as they climb the learning curve, but since there's an option to turn off all flags, it seems rather redundant. And while it's nice to keep on racing, not many players want to do it for two hours at a stretch, which is your only option if you plan to finish an entire race, since there's no way to save your game during competition."", ""Fortunately, the developers of NASCAR Heat have been fielding comments from fans and critics and already have a patch that addresses some of these issues and a few other less-noticeable bugs. But one thing that it doesn't resolve is the problem with multiplayer support: The only way to find opponents is to use fan-made chat rooms and a clever user-created utility for finding NASCAR Heat servers."", ""Yet even with its problems, NASCAR Heat's thoroughly immersive driving model is very enjoyable, and even running practice laps or chasing the pros is practically worth the price of the game. However, NASCAR racing fans who prefer consistent realism would be well advised to wait on the patch before purchasing NASCAR Heat.<i>--Stephen Poole</i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc.

Pac-Man: Adventures in Time - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Players journey back in time to the '80s and beyond in <i>Pac-Man: Adventures in Time</i>. The ghosts have stolen a magical power pellet, smashed it, and scattered the pieces across his planet. With the help of Professor Pac-Man, players will travel to five time periods and from Egypt to the Wild West. There are 45 3-D mazes featuring different elevations and terrains, and designs such as spheres and cylinders. With the exception of Pac-Man's ability to jump, gameplay has remained faithful to the arcade version--he can only move in four directions and does not use objects. Don't go crazy with the jumping, however; when the jump meter runs out, Pac-Man is stuck on the ground. There are 16 playable sublevels containing hidden games that link the mazes, and there are bonus items like pretzels and doughnuts. Players can compete via a LAN or over the Internet."", 'When the original Pac-Man hit arcades well over a decade ago, it was an instant hit because of its distinctive graphics and simple yet challenging and addicting gameplay. Since then, there have been a number of games featuring the jovial pellet-eating hero, all of which tried to capitalize on his fame. In most cases, these attempts proved unsuccessful, which has caused the Pac-Man license to lose much of the popularity it accumulated in its early arcade days. The latest effort, Pac-Man: Adventures in Time, is an attempt to bring Pac-Man back to his roots, but with surprisingly solid 3D graphics, good level design, and a few new gameplay features.', ""The most impressive aspect of Pac-Man: Adventures in Time is the graphics. The colorful 3D graphics and the overhead perspective do a great job of giving Adventures in Time a brand-new appearance while still retaining the same simple colors and shapes as in the original game. In the Ancient Egypt levels, there are Pac-Man hieroglyphs on the walls that are clear and vibrantly colored; even hieroglyphs that seem to have deteriorated over time or are covered in sand are clearly noticeable. The game also effectively uses some full-motion video effects in some of the later stages, such as the train stage, where the scenery rushes by as Pac-Man jumps from car to car while collecting pellets. You'll also notice subtle lighting effects that highlight Pac-Man's robust shape, but they're not quite as apparent in some stages as they are in others. Adventures in Time also manages to retain a brisk frame rate even on a machine with the minimum system requirements."", ""Pac-Man's transition into a lush, fully 3D world introduces some new twists to the classic Pac-Man gameplay. Instead of restricting a stage to one single flat maze, you can make Pac-Man run up walls, slide down or climb up hills, and use elevators to reach different platforms. These new environmental features are incorporated seamlessly into the traditional Pac-Man gameplay thanks to the game's solid level design. For instance, obstacles are used in such a manner that they don't just block your progress, but they are actually a well-integrated part of the level. One stage places you in the middle of a cave that slopes down toward the middle where a sleeping dragon is located, and every time the dragon takes a deep breath and exhales, it spews a fireball that travels down a particular part of the maze. Another level takes place in the middle of a medieval jousting tournament as two jousters travel back and forth across a particular section of the level. In the various Egyptian levels, you'll see baskets that contain snakes that will lunge at you if you get too close. There are even environmental objects within the levels that can aid you in your task, such as during one of the Wild West levels that takes place in a saloon with a piano. You can actually run by the piano to make it play, which causes the ghost monsters chasing after you to completely ignore you as they start dancing uncontrollably. In addition, different types of terrain in each of the levels can cause Pac-Man to slow down and speed up accordingly, which can make it challenging to judge how close you are to one of the ghosts or an obstacle - especially in the later levels when the ghosts speed up and the obstacles become more difficult to avoid."", ""Pac-Man has a number of new abilities to help him navigate the terrain and capture pellets. Now you can make Pac-Man jump to avoid ghosts, boulders, or any other dangerous obstacles that might be in your way. Unfortunately Pac-Man doesn't really get a chance to use his new abilities that often because it can be very difficult to properly time a jump to avoid danger. Controlling Pac-Man also becomes an issue in the later levels because Pac-Man moves in whatever direction you point him in, and he doesn't stop moving in that direction until pointed otherwise, which makes the game's control seem sluggish and unresponsive when you're trying to make sharp turns as a ghost chases you."", 'The game offers three different multiplayer modes that are equally well-done twists on the classic game. The best of these modes is ghost tag, where you must tag your opponents in order to change back into Pac-Man form and capture enough pellets to beat out the other competitors. Unfortunately, there is no online player-matching service included with the game, so finding an online multiplayer game may be difficult, but Adventures in Time does have a hot-seat option for four players at one computer, and you can also play against computer-controlled opponents.', ""Pac-Man: Adventures in Time attempts to take the classic Pac-Man formula and adapt it to a three-dimensional world and succeeds at doing so while still retaining the classic sense of the original game. The single-player levels, as well as the multiplayer modes and the minigames, all keep Adventures in Time from becoming repetitive too quickly, though in essence it's still just a remake of the classic Pac-Man. The occasionally sluggish control can be a little frustrating but not enough to take the fun out of the game.<i>--Giancarlo Varanini</i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

You control three characters who are forced to explore an abandoned base located on the red planet, and each character will travel alone (as per the orders gleaned from the demolished base's last recorded transmission). Characters exchange items via vacuum tubes, which are dispersed throughout the complex. Such exchanges are essential to the solving of puzzles and the general flow of inventory.

Heretic 2 (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['This game is the newest title in the bestselling <I>Heretic-Hexen</I> series. A third-person action game based on the <I>Quake 2</I> engine, <I>Heretic 2</I> sets players on a quest through vast city and outdoor environments as they search for a cure to a deadly evil plague before all is lost. Using the <I>Quake 2</I> engine, <I>Heretic 2</I> plunges you into a deep, compelling game that combines brutal face-to-face combat and mystery-laden adventure in the most advanced graphics engine yet. From a third-person perspective, gamers travel through complex, richly detailed environments filled with stunning special effects, wicked magic spells, detailed characters, vivid artwork, and challenging-level designs created by the Raven team and renowned fantasy artist Brom.', 'Didn\'t seem like a good idea when Raven Software announced it was working on Heretic II. After all, Heretic, the original Doom clone, spawned the Doom engine-based sequel Hexen, which gave rise to the Quake engine-based Hexen II. So when the Raven team decided to pull a fast one and create a ""true"" sequel to the original Heretic based on the Quake II engine, it seemed like they were just being cute. But it turns out Raven was dead serious, as not only is Heretic II a satisfying departure from the lukewarmly received Hexen series, but it\'s a bold step away from the genre\'s traditional first-person confinement. Heretic II, which plays from a behind-the-back third-person perspective, still controls a lot like a first-person shooter, but it\'s different enough to look and feel not just like a great new shooter, but like a great new kind of game. You wouldn\'t want to live there, but the world of Heretic II is a beautiful place to visit. Sure, the game is based on the Quake II engine, but you\'d never guess from looking at it since it looks just that much better. Gone are the claustrophobic corridors of id\'s shooter. Instead you get expansive, meticulously detailed, and tastefully colored architecture that is amazing to behold more often than not. Even those sorts of places that are traditionally ugly and drab, like swamps and dusty old temples, look absolutely stunning in Heretic II, with fog and lighting effects subtly implemented to make such places look both real and fantastic. All the environments look different, from room to room, and especially from level to level. A host of appropriately dressed, appropriately sinister monsters populate each region, and all of them look great even if some look a little puny. Best of all, they die in spectacular gouts of blood and gore, and you can even dismember the humanoid ones with your sword staff. The violence is accented by appropriate if somewhat subdued and nondescript sound effects and a correspondingly meek and understated musical score. <P>Since the soft-spoken elf hero Corvus is in the spotlight at all times, he\'s made to look especially detailed. He walks, runs, sneaks, sidesteps, crawls, rolls, flips, climbs, and swims much as you\'d expect from an elf of his stature, but he\'s at his most impressive when he\'s fighting. The mainstay in Corvus\' arsenal is his sword staff, which he\'ll power up to stunning potency over the course of his quest. He has several slick moves with this weapon and can even pole-vault with it to make those especially difficult jumps. The brunt of his ranged weapons are magic spells, including fire- and lightning-based attacks, and worse. All of these look dazzling as they light up the screen, and if anything, they\'re not quite as devastating in effect as they are in appearance. Corvus has other tricks up his sleeve: a Hellstaff, which fires energy bolts at a furious rate; the Storm Bow, whose magical red arrows create deadly thunder showers; and the Phoenix Bow, whose ammunition explodes in the image of its fiery namesake. All of these can be powered up temporarily by means of the Tome of Power, which makes the attacks even more spectacular to behold, and all the deadlier in practice. <P>While it was a single-use power-up in previous Heretic games, the Tome is now a persistent item (not to mention a character in the story) that requires defensive mana for its effects, which also fuels several useful defensive spells. From the meteor shield, whose shimmering green boulders wait in orbit and lash out at your enemies, to the fearsome morph ovum that turns your enemies into henpecked shells of their former selves, the defensive spells are as impressive as the main arsenal. Using offensive and defensive abilities in proper conjunction all while dodging enemy attacks is the key to Heretic II, and although it\'s a similar enough feel to your typical first-person shooter, it\'s hardly the same. Certainly the third-person perspective gives you a better sense of dodging enemy attacks, but the camera, which only rarely obstructs your view, does in fact inhibit some of your peripheral vision and makes it difficult to detect enemies attacking from the flanks. Corvus has a lot of moves in his repertoire, and most of them are useful, but altogether he moves a little sluggishly compared with your typical first-person action hero, especially while sidestepping. Still, he could run circles around Lara Croft any day, and a simple, even amusing tutorial will help you get acquainted with how he operates in no time. <P>Heretic II fixes most every shortcoming the series ever had, in large part by returning to the Heretic formula rather than following the Hexen tradition. Although Hexen and its sequel each offered three character classes to choose from, the same resources could have gone into making a single, far more interesting protagonist. That\'s what Raven did with Heretic II, whose hero packs so much firepower that you won\'t soon find yourself getting bored using the same old magic tricks. Better yet, the levels are finely paced, with ammunition and mana in rather short supply such that you\'ll have to be conservative with your attacks, even as new weapons, spells, and power-ups are introduced with perfect timing. The levels are large, cohesive, and intuitively structured, and you even get nicely acted in-game cutscenes during and between them. You can travel back and forth between certain areas in a throwback to the Hexen and Quake II hub system, but much like those other games, the hub system doesn\'t work all that well. It\'s just not much fun to have to backtrack, even if you do face new enemies on the way back, but it is a convenient means of increasing the length of the game. Searching for keys to locked doors or pushing three buttons in sequence isn\'t much fun either, and you\'ll be forced to do such petty tasks occasionally, but never in excess. <P>If there\'s any real fault to Heretic II, it\'s in the name - this game is in a league above its predecessors, and although it continues the original\'s plot and holds over many of its weapons and items, it mustn\'t be regarded with the kind of prejudice its predecessors might evoke. Otherwise, sure, the game suffers from a bug or two, level load times aren\'t insubstantial, the third-person perspective thing isn\'t exactly revolutionary, and altogether the game isn\'t very long (although it\'s worth replaying cooperatively). Occasional areas in Heretic II can be frustrating either because they\'re difficult or because they\'re confusing, and as a deathmatch game, it isn\'t as fast and furious as Quake. But one look at the game, one taste of any of the weapons it places at your disposal, and you\'ll forget all about the little things like that. <I>--Greg Kasavin </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Pharaoh Official Expansion: Cleopatra - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The Nile calls once again as the Queen of Kings takes center stage in <I>Pharaoh Official Expansion: Cleopatra</I>, with four new campaigns for Pharaoh. Offering a completely new story line, starting with the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, this expansion pack includes the mysterious and exotic time of Cleopatra VII.', ""Most expansion packs simply add a few new items and missions and assume that fans of the original game will be content to just play more of the same. With Cleopatra, developer BreakAway Games hasn't taken such an easy route. Cleopatra adds more of just about everything, from imports to monuments, and makes Impressions' Pharaoh a more complex and interesting game, without disrupting the fine balance of the original. The minor problems in Pharaoh haven't been addressed, and one new problem has been added, but it's safe to say that anyone who loved or even liked the original will be entirely content with this weighty addition."", ""As in Pharaoh, Cleopatra's missions are basically variations on a single theme. You must build the infrastructure of a city by ensuring that your residents have food, water, and the luxuries they want. You must provide the food by fishing, hunting, and farming, and then distribute the food to your residents through markets. You must build workshops to make pottery, linen, papyrus, beer, and other important goods, as well as find and supply the needed raw materials. When certain raw materials - goods or foodstuffs - are not available, you must import them from other cities. And you must create goods for export in order to maintain a positive cash flow, especially when your import costs are high."", 'You win a mission by achieving set ratings in certain categories, such as prosperity - the quality of life in your city and your overall wealth; kingdom - how well your city is regarded by others; culture - the amount of civilized niceties available to your people; and also by successfully constructing monuments.', 'Cleopatra makes the whole process a bit more complex by adding two new industries, lamp making and paint making. Lamps are made from pottery and oil, of which the latter can only be imported, while paint making requires henna, which can be farmed. The new industries are essential to the construction of some of the new monuments, the best of which are the tombs. To build royal tombs, you need paint to decorate the walls, and lamps to light the caves where the artisans work. You also need to stock these tombs with luxury items, which makes monument building even more involving.', ""The campaigns in Cleopatra follow the basic formula of Pharaoh, but add a few interesting twists and challenges. The first campaign requires that you build the Valley of the Kings by constructing the royal tombs in the cliffs and, as the campaign goes on, that you keep them safe from grave robbers. Cleopatra starts off at approximately the same difficulty at which Pharaoh left off, and quickly gets much harder. Some missions now have time limits, which can make them much more difficult for players who're used to slowly building an infrastructure before tackling the larger mission objectives. While such constraints certainly can be frustrating, they help to break up the occasional monotony that occurs once you've found a city-building pattern that works."", ""The second new campaign in Cleopatra deals with the arrival of new enemies, while the third deals with the reign of Ramses II, and the fourth with that of Cleopatra herself. The first campaign basically acts as a primer to the new elements, while the others require that you use everything at your disposal to stop the near-constant invasion of enemies. The military element of Cleopatra is tougher than in the original, and you'll even have to complete some missions that simply require you to survive an onslaught for a given time."", 'Most of the new challenges in Cleopatra are welcome and serve not only to extend the game, but also to enhance it. Among these challenges are the plagues - problems of epic proportions - that occur when the gods are displeased with you. Rivers of blood, swarms of locusts and frogs, and hailstorms all add to your need to keep any and all of your patron deities as pleased as possible at all times.', ""Cleopatra does include a few unwelcome additions, like creatures that will attack your populace. The scorpions in the first two missions will undoubtedly make you frustrated as they wander your streets and kill your people. You can theoretically take them out with military personnel, as you are advised to do in the game's help file, which would be fine if you could actually recruit military personnel in these missions. Also, there is a strange bug that occurs when building tombs - if you dispatch any of the luxury goods to the tomb before it's completed, all production on the tomb will stop. However, not only will this affect your current game, it will also affect any saved games you have in that mission, requiring you to start over completely."", ""What's more problematic is the fact that one of Pharaoh's more frustrating elements has still not been addressed. Quite simply, your workers are still as dumb as dirt, and they wander the streets as if they were windup toys bouncing around your city. You'll have food and water distributors wandering completely unpopulated areas, while residents are moving out because they're starving and thirsty. You can help reduce this problem through strategic placement of markets and the use of roadblocks, but it would have been nice if these key elements had some sort of artificial intelligence that would have sent them where they were needed, within a limited range."", ""But this problem is endemic to Pharaoh (and the Caesar games before it), and Cleopatra can't be entirely faulted for not addressing it, especially when the additions in this expansion are so numerous and so much fun. Cleopatra is both more difficult and more complex than Pharaoh, but it also makes the game seem new and fresh. And you can't ask much more than that from an expansion pack. <br>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

UK-based developer Spiral House clearly felt that PC gamers needed a bit more style in their role-playing, so they created Silver, which was released on the PC last year. Now, the console-style RPG intended for the PC has ironically made its way to Dreamcast. However, Console gamers already used to the style Silver emulates may not be so accepting.', ""Silver's story is a familiar one as video game adventures go. The game's title character is a wicked sorcerer-emperor who oversees the world of Jarrah with an iron fist and a hard heart. One day, Silver orders that all the fair maidens of the land be brought before him so that he can select a new bride. His minions then round up Jarrah's female population for Silver's ghastly perusal; needless to say, the male half isn't pleased. The player takes control of David, a kindly, if stereotypically blonde, knight whose wife Jennifer was among the captured. David strikes out, full of vim and vigor, to stop Silver and retrieve the women. On his journey, David learns that Silver is trying to strike a deal with the evil god Apocalypse, and thus his quest gains even greater import. David also learns that only the combined power of eight magical orbs, which have been lost for years, can defeat Silver, and thereafter most of the game is devoted to obtaining these orbs. This isn't the most generic plotline ever, but it sure isn't Dickens, either. Add one part Final Fantasy, two parts Legend of Zelda, and stir."", ""The graphical presentation in Silver is crisp, but not particularly inspired. Characters are represented by simplistic polygonal models, and though they don't sport much detail, they're usually seen from such great distance that detail isn't necessary. The world of Jarrah is composed of prerendered backdrops like those found in the PlayStation Final Fantasy titles. They often contain hot spots, such as switches, doors, or treasure chests, which can be revealed by holding down the L trigger. This is an entirely necessary feature, because these spots often blend into the background, and they are sometimes almost impossible to detect. The static camera angles used in some backgrounds are poorly chosen because of their distance from the action; it's not uncommon for Silver to force David into a battle when he's only a few pixels tall as seen by the player."", ""Speaking of battle, Silver conducts combat much like a typical Zelda title. All the fighting happens in real-time on the standard background screens. David is joined in battle by up to two companions, starting with his grandfather (whose death is perhaps one of the most contrived moments in video game history) and ranging from the slingshot-wielding rebel girl Sekune to Jug, the standard barbarian type. The AI that controls the other party members works periodically, but it is largely a failure, as David's friends are never eager to avoid attacks or to attack enemies themselves. Fortunately, control can be passed at will from David to either of his compatriots, although all the characters are nearly identical in actual combat. A variety of fighting moves are provided, such as jabs, swipes, and backhand chops, but frankly the best strategy is simply to point in the direction of the enemy and hit the attack button as fast as possible."", 'Special weapon attacks, magical items, and magic itself round out the list of offensive and defensive options at David\'s disposal.  Weapons, magic, and healing items are all controlled from the ""pie menu,"" a circular arrangement that otherwise behaves like any standard RPG menu. The pie menu also allows access to David\'s stats, but these numbers seem superficial because the game raises his level only at preset times (specifically, after defeating a boss). A world map is the last notable feature found on the pie menu, and it allows the player to instantly transport back to any location previously visited.', ""As a game, Silver is well-intentioned but flawed. It draws on a variety of console role-playing's staple elements, but never to truly great effect. The story is bland. The graphics are decent, but certainly not earth-shattering. Combat situations usually degenerate into a frenzy of button mashing, and they're often obscured by camera problems.  Music, often a high point in RPGs, is mostly average and rarely above average. On the whole, the voice acting is reproachful (especially the lines recorded for David himself, who is apparently one of the most deadened characters in RPG history). Nothing about Silver is unbearably horrid, but it never clicks like really classic games do."", ""It's amusing that Silver, a game targeted at an audience not used to the conventions of console role-playing, is now available for one of the very consoles on which those conventions are repeatedly exercised. Silver might be novel for a PC enthusiast looking for a bit of action, but jaded console gamers won't find anything new. If you've got an insatiable jones for RPGs and adventure games, playing Silver wouldn't be the worst thing you've ever done, but it wouldn't really be the best either.<i>--Brad Shoemaker</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc.

Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"['Disc(s) only. Ships in generic case. Disc(s) are professoinally cleaned. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', ""Though the name may be quite a mouthful, Walt Disney World Quest Magical Racing Tour is a wonderful lighthearted cart-racing game that fans of the genre will surely enjoy. Followers of the world of Disney will also undoubtedly be attracted to the game levels, which are modeled after many of the popular attractions at Walt Disney World. Either way, it's hard to go wrong with WDWQMRT. The story behind the game is that Chip and Dale have accidentally clogged up the Magic Kingdom's fireworks machine with a few accidentally placed acorns. The machine then went haywire and exploded, sending pieces of the machine to nearly every location of the park. It's up to you to race with everyone else in the park and collect pieces of the machine so it can be put back together.  You can select from a variety of Disney characters such as Chip and Dale, Moe Whiplash, Bruno Biggs, Otto Plugnut, Polly Roger, and Baron Karlott - just to name a few. The game does have a few other characters that are hidden and that can be unlocked by completing the game. Playing as the Disney character is a lot of fun, but the real treat is exploring the levels you get to race through. All 13 of the game's levels are modeled after the popular rides and attractions within the Magic Kingdom, such as Big Thunder Mountain, the Haunted Mansion, and the Pirates of the Caribbean. Each level is altered so that you can race in and through different parts of the attraction. In addition, most of the levels have specific vehicles that fit the theme of the attraction. For instance, when you reach the Space Mountain track all of the racers pilot little one-man hover/rocket ships. The different vehicles really don't control all that differently, but they add a bit of verity and style.  The gameplay of Disney's Magical Racing Tour is straightforward, fun, and involving. It has the typical cart-racing game setup where you race laps around a track and pick up items like teacups and acorns, which you can launch at your opponents. Controlling the carts is very easy - all you really do is steer, accelerate, and break. The only real strategy in the game comes into play when you are trying to take shortcuts or when you are using items. Visually, Magical Racing Tour is very nice. The game moves at a brisk pace and provides a wonderful sense of speed. Moreover, the levels never really pop up in front of you - the point at which the level is drawn in is always far out of view. All of the characters are very detailed and articulated, as are the various vehicles they pilot through the levels. The levels themselves are awesome; when racing, you find yourself being distracted by objects and characters that you've seen before throughout the game.  In the audio department, Magical Racing Tour does a great job of re-creating the experience of visiting the park. The game's opening and menu screens are accompanied by the infamous It's a Small World ditty, which gets under your skin just as fast as it does in real life. Each of the levels has the specific music and sound effects that you'd hear if you were actually at the park on the ride. During the Pirates of the Caribbean level, you can hear the individual animatronic characters speaking the lines that have made the ride such a favorite.  Disney's Magical Racing Tour on the surface may just seem like another Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing clone, and once you spend any amount of time with the game you'll realize that, at its core, it truly is one. However, with its awesome levels, characters, vehicles, shortcuts, items, overall presentation, and gameplay, Magical Racing Tour has more than enough style - and it offers a different enough experience - to make the game worthwhile. In addition, those that love the world of Disney will find the game to be a surprising treat that is wonderfully fun, not only for its content but also for its gameplay.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Warlords Battlecry - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<I>Warlords Battlecry</I> takes real-time strategy gameplay into the next generation with hero-based gameplay. Create a hero in one of eight races and then take him and his armies through campaigns, quests, and multiplayer games. Choose from humans, dwarfs, orcs, minotaurs, undead, high elf, dark elf, and wood elf. Your hero and his armies must set out on either a path of good or a path of evil to destroy the Two Tears (two powerful and mystical meteorites) before they fall into the wrong hands. As you win scenarios, campaigns, or multiplayer games and your hero gains experience, he will be able to choose a specialty class that will strengthen his attributes: warrior, priest, rogue, or wizard. Your hero becomes an extension of you, the gameplayer, because of the time you'll invest to create and develop the hero. <I>Warlords Battlecry</I> brings a Dungeons and Dragons/RPG aspect to the RTS genre. Your hero continues to develop over time, no matter the type of game you play."", ""There has been a slew of impressive, new 3D real-time strategy games recently, but if you've ever enjoyed the great 2D strategy games of years past - or enjoy high-fantasy-themed games in general - then you'll like Warlords Battlecry, the latest game in developer SSG's long-running Warlords series. Die-hard fans of previous Warlords games and their signature turn-based gameplay may initially find Battlecry's real-time combat system unappealing. But after playing for a while, and developing a hero character, you'll find that it's hard to tear yourself away from the game, even if you're used to turn-based games. That's because Warlords Battlecry is a solid real-time strategy game that borrows heavily from games like Warcraft II and the Heroes of Might and Magic series. If you enjoyed those games, then Warlords Battlecry definitely has something to offer you."", ""As in most real-time strategy games, Warlords is played from an overhead, isometric perspective. The game features nine races: humans, orcs, minotaurs, barbarians, dwarves, undead, and three varieties of elves. After creating a hero character, you begin the campaign and set up shop by building a base, barracks, and a blacksmith. You can then proceed to buy units and unit upgrades to weapons and armor and so forth. It's standard real-time strategy at first; every upgrade and unit has a price, and there are four resources to mine, which are used in various combinations as payment. Fortunately, once you take control of a mine, any gold, stone, metal, or crystal is automatically accumulated over time. Adding a peasant to a mine speeds up the mining process. This automatic resource collection lets you concentrate on bigger issues, like vanquishing a horde of minotaurs. Each race's dependency on resources differs, which adds another element to the strategy, especially in missions where it becomes necessary to set up a garrison by a critical mine or destroy a mine that's vital to your enemy's development."", ""However, the most noticeable feature that sets Warlords Battlecry apart from other real-time strategy games are the hero characters. Your hero character is the focus of the game. Heroes have a command radius, and any armies within range automatically get bonuses, such as increased speed, power, and armor. The catch is that you also need to protect your hero at all costs, especially during the single-player game where you suffer automatic defeat if your hero falls. As such, it's not always wise to have your hero accompany your troops, especially if he's not quick on his feet. Your hero is also indispensable because of his ability to convert neutral or enemy mines and buildings. Generals are the only other troops that have this conversion power, but they are very high in the technology tree, and hence take a while to produce. Having a single character that you must protect, and who can also make your troops more powerful, adds an interesting new dimension to the gameplay."", ""Fortunately, Battlecry's interface is easy to use, and has all the features of a good real-time strategy interface. You can queue up just about any number of units or tasks, including waypoints, building production, unit production, and upgrades. You can easily group units into specific preset formations. The game can also be paused at any time, at which point you can queue up as many orders as you like. You can also set hotkeys to select specific groups of units or to activate spells. This makes complicated orders a little easier to execute, especially when you're under fire. Finally, you can fine-tune your troops' attitudes, which range from cowardly to berserk. This last feature comes in handy, mostly when you want your hero to stay put or when you want to lure enemy troops within range of your defensive towers. Your hero advances in level with each victory. Between battles you can spend accumulated experience points on myriad abilities that give your units even more bonuses. The sheer number of options for customizing the hero is impressive, and it certainly adds to the game's replay value. You'll probably be inclined to create a few different heroes and alternate between them as you experiment with the various abilities and witness their effects in practice. The game's manual is chock-full of tables that tell you exactly what effect your upgrades will have on your armies. In addition, heroes developed in skirmish battles can be carried over to an Internet game to compete with other heroes."", 'Up to four players can play over the Internet, either in co-op mode or against each other. To spice up the multiplayer experience, you can choose one of thirteen different victory conditions. These include capture the flag, assassination, in which your hero must survive, and ""against the horde,"" where one player commands a huge army and two others join forces to bring down his huge force.', 'In fact, there are many more ways to play Warlords Battlecry. The single-player campaign leads you on a quest for a powerful talisman called the Tears of Dawn. The campaign follows six chapters, which are divided into 36 episodes. At the end of the second chapter, the campaign takes a decisive turn, as you must choose between a path of good and a path of evil. Overall, the branching single-player campaign is fairly engaging and challenging. As each mission begins, your key characters will discuss how they will tackle the opposition, which helps you get into the story and also helps you to start planning a strategy. After completing a mission, the story continues through video cutscenes.', ""Warlords Battlecry also features a good skirmish mode. Before you begin a skirmish game against the computer, you can also customize many settings, from how many opponents you'll face and who your allies are, to the victory conditions. The flexible skirmish mode, together with the relatively open-ended campaign, greatly enhances Battlecry's single-player replay value."", ""The graphics in Warlords Battlecry are mostly good. Many of the units, especially the orcs and humans, immediately recall Warcraft II, while others may appear similar to those in other fantasy-themed games. The unit animations are fluid, and they lend a lot of personality to each character - for instance, when standing idle, undead skeletons will flip their swords up in the air; orcs lumber around with oversized spiked clubs; and mages peer into spellbooks as if to brush up before a battle. There are also unique animations for more than 80 spells that your hero and mage units can cast. In general, the game's artwork, from the hero portraits to unit animations, has just the right balance of humor and high-fantasy style."", 'Warlords Battlecry sounds much like it looks. As in most real-time strategy games, each unit has its own response when you select it. Some of the speech is really great: The powerful, winged archon\'s decree of ""For the light!"" echoes as if he were much more imposing than the rest of the party. And the orc shaman is something of a prima donna, as he says things like ""Shaman coming through!"" and ""I\'m dangerous, you know?"" When troops engage in battle, you\'ll even hear them shouting various taunts. Otherwise, the music in Battlecry is nothing terribly special, but it suitably adds to the fantasy setting.', ""Warlords Battlecry does have a few small problems, such as the game's sometimes-predictable artificial intelligence. During skirmishes on smaller maps, the computer-controlled enemy hero sometimes seeks out resources too aggressively and will charge into your camp far too early, thus making him easy prey. You may also find that Battlecry crashes every now and again on your system for no apparent reason."", ""In a market that's presently saturated with 3D real-time strategy games, many of which have science-fiction themes, it's great to see a 2D fantasy game that actually brings something new to the table. While Warlords Battlecry is evidently derivative of other fantasy-themed strategy games, its combination of elements taken from its predecessors makes the game unique in its own right. The focus on heroes particularly adds an interesting angle to the gameplay, and along with the de-emphasis on resource gathering, it makes the game seem substantially different from its predecessors. Also, the sheer variety of units and play options ought to keep you occupied for a long time. So if you're interested in real-time strategy games and don't mind getting a little nostalgic, then you ought to give Warlords Battlecry a shot. <br>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc.

Azure Dreams,,['Playstation one game'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Game Boy Color', 'Games']",{},"['GameSpot Review\nYou are 15 years old. You are now of age to take on the role of ""monster tamer,"" a position your late father once held. In fact, your father was considered the greatest monster tamer in all the land. Your family name is legendary, and you have a lot to live up to. Your destiny is to enter the Demon Tower and retrieve the eggs of rare and exotic creatures, which you will then breed for companionship or to sell to the highest bidder. Such is the premise of Konami\'s newest RPG, Azure Dreams.\nIn the case of Konami, credit must be given where credit is due. Up until the time of the second generation of 32-bit games, RPGs had remained largely on the outskirts of most gamers\' tastes. It was a niche market defined by superdeformed characters, idiosyncratic Japanese overtones, and a sword and sorcery prerequisite that intimidated the average consumer. While 16-bit titles such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy III, and Super Mario RPG had been relatively successful, they were hardly selling as well as games like Mortal Kombat or Madden 93. So upon entering the 32-bit market, RPG fans had very little to choose from - Mystaria for the Saturn, Beyond the Beyond for the PlayStation, Shining Wisdom, and so on. So, while most people credit Final Fantasy VII for opening the floodgates for the impending wave of RPGs, it was really Suikoden that laid the groundwork. Despite its lackluster graphics, Suikoden\'s rich storyline and lengthy quest appealed not only to hard-core gamers, but to the novice role-player as well. It was so successful that Konami decided to translate its other 32-bit RPG, Vandal Hearts, almost immediately after Suikoden\'s release. Now, after the face of next-generation gaming has been permanently altered by games like Wild Arms, Persona, Dragon Force, Tactics Ogre, and Panzer Dragoon Saga, Konami has decided the time is right to release its most bizarre RPG to date.']",Konami,"['>#122,130 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#638 in Video Games &gt; More Systems &gt; Game Boy Color &gt; Games']",,Video Games,B00004TNUK

New weapons & tools, more moves than ever before!', 'Who would have guessed when we met her that Lara Croft - assertive, independent, self-assured, and a phenomenal shot - would prove to be such a tease? Having virtually defined a new genre of third-person action-adventure in 1996, the Tomb Raider franchise lures us back each holiday season much like an old relationship trying to rekindle itself with promises that ""it has grown"" and that ""things will be different and even better this time around."" However, with the last two games, developer Core and publisher Eidos have disappointed even some of Lara\'s most devoted fans. The series refuses to evolve beyond the basic yet beguiling formula: leap around ancient tombs, shoot foes (animal, human, and superhuman), and unravel the elaborate puzzles and traps that guard these premodern mysteries. Lara does have some new moves in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, but in the end, none of them takes her far enough in any new direction.', ""Nevertheless, The Last Revelation is far and away the best of the sequels, mainly because Core has finally added some coherence to all aspects of the game. There's actually a story this time: Lara mistakenly unleashes the Egyptian god Set after eons of imprisonment. Before the evil spirit wreaks destruction on the planet, Lara must put this gnarly genie back in the bottle. Frequent prerendered and in-game cutscenes punctuate the action, as Lara's cliched German enemy Dr. Von Croy challenges her at every turn. At least we do see Lara having actual conversations, especially with her mentor Jean-Pierre, who adds to the plot by getting kidnapped later in the tale. And in the final leg, The Last Revelation takes a Hitchcockian turn, thrusting Lara into some of the world's most familiar landmarks, the Sphinx and Great Pyramid."", ""While its story is not as interesting as LucasArts' recent Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, the plot in The Last Revelation succeeds in keeping Lara in one part of the world, Middle East ruins, rather than trying to ensure the game has the requisite variety by sending her trotting across the globe. These levels now blend more seamlessly, and in many instances, Lara must move back and forth among several different areas to gather the artifacts or throw the levers that advance her onward. While it makes for a more cohesive game experience, shuffling back and forth as well as enduring repeated loading times can be frustrating. In the Alexandria section midway through the game, you start from a coastal ruins area and veer off into almost a dozen smaller side journeys that lead back to the ruins in the end. As your inventory swells with the various pieces of several unfinished puzzles, some of them well hidden, just keeping track of the immediate task at hand becomes a major challenge. Nevertheless, the payoff is a greater sense of narrative structure. From the opening Tomb of Set to the finale in the Great Pyramid and Temple of Horus, The Last Revelation keeps an overall purpose in view, and this is something Lara always needed."", ""The more fluid story and coherent setting have positive effects on puzzle design as well. Make no mistake, The Last Revelation is the most cerebral of the series. Very few manic boss villains, or even timed sprinting challenges, force Lara to leap and shoot with split-second accuracy. Most foes are dispatched easily, but only when you realize their weakness. This strategic aspect to firefights is more in keeping with the game's adventure and puzzle theme. Generally, Core has returned to the widget-hunting, block-pushing, lever-grabbing gameplay for which the original Tomb Raider is known. While some of the puzzles are tough in The Last Revelation, they are more sensible and well integrated with the story than in the previous sequels. In the Great Hypostyle Hall, for instance, Lara must open up a new exit by making artful use of her guns and a teetering boulder. In another hall, a celestial map is both a puzzle to be solved and an expressive artifact of Egyptian mythology. Clearly, Core has taken greater care in the construction of Lara's obstacles. Of course, if you take a step back, it seems preposterous that a spelunking heroine meets logic puzzles at every turn. But within the suspended disbelief of the Tomb Raider fiction, these obstacles feel more sensible and more naturally a part of Lara's adventure.There is action in The Last Revelation. It's just not as hair-raising and daunting as in the second and third Tomb Raider games. One especially good sequence is a very-well-done train chase, in which Lara fights off ninjas and pursues Von Croy across boxcar after boxcar. Lara also gets an infrared laser sight that combines with her revolver or bow for long-range or precise targeting, which is fortunate because a few of your otherworldly foes require some very sharp shooting to take down. Binoculars also come in later in the game for spotting far-off puzzle clues. Of course, Lara learned to drive years ago, so the jeep and motorcycle (with sidecar) rides are nothing new, though they make for refreshing bits of action. Rope swinging is new, though timing Lara's swings and leaps from rope to rope is probably more exasperating than it's worth. And the retooled inventory system now lets you combine objects, though it is used too little."", ""In fact, none of the new Tomb Raider features, from the stronger adventure motif to the slightly upgraded graphics engine, is made especially overt. The game itself is very enjoyable - it's challenging and absorbing, if no longer very surprising. Visually, the game gets somewhat better texture detail, and Lara now has a one-piece wraparound skin, which lends her a more detailed, expressive face and lifelike look. The PR department has made a lot out of letting us play a teenaged Lara early in the game, which is nice but really amounts to just a cute way of integrating the tutorial into the game. However, Core and Eidos continue to shy away from pressing any of these mild innovations into what the Tomb Raider series has needed for so long, which is a substantial evolution of the gameplay itself. Why not engage the adventure element more wholeheartedly and give us a Lara with some depth and character and a plot really worth fighting for? Not all puzzles must involve pushing blocks and pulling levers in the right sequence."", ""It's also worth noting that all of those halfhearted attempts to rationalize the alluring Lara as a positive model of feminine power and mastery are getting harder to accept as her chest takes on the dimensions of the Astrodome. Poor Lara now looks like she's shoplifting watermelons in Cairo."", ""However, despite how frustrated we are with her creators, Lara keeps sucking us in every year because, like that old lover, she still has all the right moves. The basic engine is still unrivaled. Knockoffs and competitors continue to miss the real magic of the Tomb Raider engine - artful exaggeration. Lara still has her extremely graceful, almost superhuman movements that let us glide luxuriously through these worlds. Her running leaps are as implausible as they are fluid, and that's why she is uniquely captivating, even when the basic tasks at hand get old."", ""Ultimately, Tomb Raider IV would have made a brilliant Tomb Raider II. The changes are great, but should have been made years ago. They are less impressive now that the basic play mechanics are so familiar. Fans who want one more spelunking adventure will be pleased that this is far and away the best of the sequels. Those of us who hoped our favorite gaming girlfriend would evolve into something better will be disappointed again, only less so this year than in the past. Core has breathed just enough new life into the old girl to make it worth one more go. But, we're warning you, Lara: We're not going to fall for this little game of yours again. All of us need to move on. This is it. Last time. We mean it this time. No kidding.<i>--Steve Smith</i>-- <i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

I still pop it in when non-gaming friends come by&nbsp;&#8211; everyone loves it, everyone knows how to play it, and you get to see yourself on TV. While Groove still has this base amusement factor and functionality, it feels just plain dull.</P> <P>There are two different comparisons to be made when talking about Groove &#8211; one to the Play minigame it expands on, and one to the other rhythm games it falls into line with. We\'ll start with its predecessor. I rarely play the hit-the-speaker game in Play because I just couldn\'t figure out how to dance while still sitting on my couch, and the generic techno tunes were limited and grating. The twenty-some odd songs in Groove should fix the track issue (and there are a couple of gems in there that I really dug, but I\'m a Beatles person, so the Elvis remix wasn\'t one of them), but instead it feels like a short, predictable jaunt through disposable dance/pop tracks. </P> <P>As for not feeling the couch-bound groove, Groove does a few great things that take advantage of the camera control. Freestyle segments (which integrate new versions of the Playroom effects found in Play) and photo-ops are plopped into the middle of songs and let you just get down to your own beat for a few seconds. From a gameplay standpoint, the game adds wide, sweeping motions into the usual hit and hold commands found in other dance titles. Large stars will highlight a series of hitspots and players sweep their arms from one to the next, forcing a ""spirit fingers"", Broadway flapper kind of move.</P> <P>But, in comparison to other rhythm titles, Groove falls well south of average. Limited unlockables and even more restrictive graphics make me think, ""I could play this for three hours a day, every day, for the next six months and this would look exactly the same."" Throw a new background on there or something, man! Even new hitspots or icons would have helped.</P> <P>Also, multiplayer is a standard feature in games of this ilk, and Groove is no exception. Instead of having players side to side, dancing each other into oblivion, Groove puts them in front of each other. One dancer is blue and one is red. During the battle mode, players are supposed to hit the spots of their color &#8211; but it\'s just too manic and out of control to be much fun.</P> <P>This is truly a sad, sad day for me. I gave Play a nine, and did it with full comfort and confidence. Groove, on the other hand, is something that I would pop in only if Codemaster\'s American Idol game had irreparable scratches. This is not to say that American Idol is bad, only that Groove is less enjoyable than a licensed, knock-off title &#8211; and that\'s not good.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Expand on the dancing/rhythm game found in EyeToy: Play <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>Well, it\'s you on the screen &#8211; a somewhat fuzzy you.

No matter how much I tried to enjoy EyeToy: Groove, I couldn\'t escape the fact that it is just an expansion of EyeToy: Play\'s Beat Freak game, with a few new features and licensed tracks. It aims to be a rhythm game along the lines of DDR, but in doing so it loses all of the variety and replayability that made its predecessor so engaging. If you got sick of Beat Freak, you could always go smack some ninjas around in Kung Foo. If you get sick of Groove (which is highly likely, since there isn\'t much to spice it up), you\'ve got nowhere else to go. Play made it fun to flail around and make a fool of yourself, but Groove just makes it depressing, and I know plenty of cheaper ways to regret vigorously shaking my butt, thank you very much.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>6 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Joe Juba</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Rollcage Stage 2,,['Very Clean. Same day shipping.'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""First came Rollcage, a mildly innovative Wipeout-on-wheels whose hook was the ability to drive on walls and ceilings. The game had decent gameplay and an awesome soundtrack, but its short courses and frustrating grip physics diminished its lasting appeal. Now comes Rollcage Stage II, a sequel that purports to fix the previous game's flaws while offering a number of new features. Rollcage Stage II seeks to lure a thirsty racing audience with six main improvements: less frustration, lengthier tracks, more vehicles, more weapons, improved two-player support, and a ton of hidden secrets."", ""The first Rollcage had a major problem with tire grip and surface physics. Turning backward or becoming stuck was too easy, but worse than that, spinning in circles was a common occurrence. In the sequel, developer Attention to Detail has lowered tire grip, sped up automatic centering, and increased turn responsiveness, fixing the brunt of the original's physics issues. Further, since the vehicles in Stage II center themselves quicker while upside down, the game's antigravity premise is more succinct as well. At the same time, Rollcage Stage II offers more than 60 tracks - all of which are longer and more diverse than the original's - that contain any number of alternate paths, shortcuts, and destructible terrain objects."", ""Not content to stop with just a few improvements, Rollcage Stage II has the most diverse feature list ever witnessed in a fantasy-based racing title. In the single-player section, Rollcage Stage II offers up to 12 modes, with five available initially. The type one campaign is a season mode offering four leagues and 20 tracks of racing, the completion of which unlocks two more campaigns, bringing the total track count to 65. The arcade setting lets you play a quick race against the competition, while time attack allows you to test your skill against the clock.  Borrowing from Gran Turismo's license tests, there's also a training mode for practicing braking and a scramble mode for practicing cornering. Hidden options include such things as a survivor mode, an all-tracks race, and a mirror option. As far as cars, you begin with only three, but first place finishes and unlocked modes will increase the overall selection to 60.  Rollcage Stage II turns in a decent two-player showing as well, offering 11 total modes, ranging from single race and tournament options to such endeavors as deathmatch combat, boulder soccer, and demolition derby."", ""In contrast to the game's improved physics and deep features, Rollcage Stage II's gameplay is easier to describe: excellent. As you barrel along the tracks at over 300mph, you'll need to drive along ceilings, walls, rock formations, and other obstacles, all in an effort to beat four computer competitors. The game literally plays just like Namco's Ridge Racer or Sega's Daytona USA, only upside down and sideways. Whether you use the default directional pad or the Dual Shock analog stick, quick and responsive control is the order of the day. Place better than third, and you move on. Place first, and you'll earn some goodies. To aid you in your quest for first place, all the vehicles have two weapon pods, each of which may contain one of 12 weapons, such as homing missiles, gravity distortion bombs, and energy shields. New to Rollcage Stage II is the ability to double up attacks: You can fire your left weapon with L1 and the right with R1, but by pressing both at the same time, you can launch a combination attack. Usually, this only results in multiple projectiles or a greater speed boost, but on rare occasions, beautiful displays of opponent-stunting mayhem are produced."", ""Visually speaking, while Rollcage Stage II still suffers from the murky textures and haphazard lighting of the first game, it also improves upon its predecessor in a number of vital ways. The draw-in area is set farther down the track, eliminating the pop-up that plagued the original. As a result, the overall field of vision is wider, making for larger, more twisting courses and enabling a tenfold increase in trackside shortcuts. The lens flares, cinematic wipes, and motion blurs from the first game also return, accompanied by revamped interactive weather effects such as rain, lightning, fog, and snow. Rounding out the game's visual experience, Attention to Detail has increased both the number and the explosiveness of Rollcage Stage II's on-track obstacles.  Buildings that explode, shattering glass, and bursting flames are just a few of the many jaw-dropping effects Rollcage Stage II has to offer - all with little to no slowdown."", ""In light of all the other improvements, Rollcage Stage II's soundtrack is disappointing. The first Rollcage featured a decent blend of techno and industrial music from industry stalwarts Fatboy Slim, EZ Rollers, and Aphrodite. The sequel's soundtrack, which contains 12 new tracks from artists such as EZ Rollers, Aquasky, and Technical Itch, lacks the same impact and quality.  The repetitive backbeats and experimental crescendos are fitting, but they're not exemplary. On the upshot, the Stage II's sound effects, ranging from loud groaning engines to crisp multiple-projectile explosions, still rock the house."", ""Long story short, Rollcage Stage II is a superb sequel and an excellent futuristic racing title. The game may not have the lasting appeal of Psygnosis' Wipeout or Namco's Ridge Racer, but it has enough gameplay, eye candy, and bonus secrets to put it near the top of what the PlayStation has to offer. If anything, it certainly delivers on the premise of 360-degree racing better than its predecessor did.<i>--Frank Provo </i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Beach Head 2000 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""If you've seen Saving Private Ryan, you might agree that the first scene in the World War II film stands out from the rest. The scene lasts around 25 minutes, and it's an incredibly visceral, visually graphic re-creation of the D-Day invasion of Normandy. The action takes place from the perspective of the American troops who storm Omaha Beach in armored landing crafts, only to meet with a deadly barrage of mines and enemy fire. WizardWorks, the same publisher that brought you Deer Hunter, tries to capture the intensity of a WWII beach attack in BeachHead 2000, a loose remake of an old Commodore 64 shooter. For a short time, it may prove to be a fairly entertaining diversion. However, BeachHead 2000's limited gameplay won't hold your attention for long."", ""In BeachHead 2000, you're a lone turret gunner defending a stretch of beach that's under siege. You view the beach from a first-person perspective and aim using the mouse. Your turret is equipped with a machine gun, a howitzer cannon, and guided surface-to-air missiles. You also have a handgun to use as a last-ditch defense. At the beginning of each level, you're given a limited amount of ammo for each gun. Much of the strategy of the game comes from deciding when and where to employ this precious supply of ammo. Fortunately, supply aircraft make frequent parachuted drops of ammo and health. But to obtain these, you've got to shoot the drop-package itself. Attempting to nail these drop-offs with anything but a machine gun poses a considerable - and at times frustrating - challenge. Even if you get the extra ammo, you may still come up a few missiles or rounds short, which can make completing the level nearly impossible."", ""BeachHead 2000's graphics are OK sometimes, but pretty rough in certain respects. The enemy choppers, APCs, landing craft, tanks, and bombers are rendered in 3D with real-time lighting effects - and they actually look decent. The problem is that many of the units pop up out of nowhere, almost as if the game were rendering them late. The infantry troops don't look nearly as good: The foot soldiers look acceptable, but only from far away as they file out of the armored landing crafts. As they draw closer, their choppy animation and 2D photo-scanned faces look silly."", ""BeachHead 2000's gameplay is fast-paced and straightforward. It plays similarly to old arcade shooters like Operation Wolf and Terminator 2, only the screen doesn't ever scroll in any direction. The levels steadily increase in difficulty until it seems as if they won't get any harder. After that, you just continue on and rack up as many points as you can by gunning down the enemy. You can't actually win. The game grows old quickly, as taking out the stream of enemies in each level becomes repetitive. Even the enemy units themselves soon become predictable, as the ground and air units seem to repeat the same maneuvers over and over again. Also, although your inability to move makes sense in the context of the game, it makes the game much less engaging."", ""BeachHead 2000 isn't horrible, though it's not ambitious at all. It has moments that can be satisfying, and the gameplay is quick and easy to learn. If you're a casual game player looking to let off a little steam in a WWII environment, you might enjoy BeachHead 2000 for a little while. But the game isn't suitable for anyone else. <br />--<i>Copyright 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

In the single-player campaign, you start from the ground up, siding with a nation, enlisting its troops, and progressing through a series of 25 increasingly difficult missions until victory is achieved. Along the way, you'll earn promotion points, which you can use to improve your troops, as well as acquire a number of painful weapons. On the flipside is the multiplayer mode, which is where the game's true beauty lies. While there's a certain satisfaction attained by defeating a CPU opponent, nothing beats taking on three of your closest friends in a series of random piggy skirmishes. With team choice, weapon distribution, and even level design as user-defined variables, Hogs of War literally has limitless replay value."", ""Still, you might have noticed that the aforementioned paragraph didn't exactly tout the virtues of the game's single-player mode. There's a good reason for this: the single-player mode is dull, tedious, dreary, and uninteresting. The number of levels is fine, and each of the six continent portions is diverse, but the overall pacing worsens as time goes on. For the first five levels, you're acquiring new weapons, promoting your men, and otherwise having a nice time. Past that point, however, promotions become scarce, weapon diversity drops, and mission parameters begin to border on obtuse. It's one thing to have to capture a series of bridges or sneak into an enemy base, but it's quite another to end up on a collection of tiny islands surrounded by mine fields while the enemy sits atop high ground with mortars. So the first ten levels fly by, while the latter 15 may take you days, even weeks to complete - not because they're tough, but because they induce massive amounts of boredom along the way."", ""Compounding the game's pacing problem, Hogs of War's graphics do nothing to elicit inspiration or excitement for the task at hand. Due to the subject matter, one could say that the game is aimed at younger audiences, but even that doesn't account for how bland and primitive Hogs of War's visuals are. The pigs themselves are adequate, smiling and cowering with a unique aura of cartoon-inspired hilarity, but the background environments and standing structures constantly distract with their blocky, jagged, and choppy appearances. Additionally, the hills, valleys, trenches, islands, and bridges in Hogs of War don't even live up to the baseline visual standards set by 3DO's Army Men series, instead resembling earlier PlayStation efforts such as Warhawk or Assault Rigs."", 'Other than the aforementioned single-player pacing issues and the subpar visuals, Hogs of War does have a lot going for it. First, the weapon diversity is astounding. Your pigs can follow one of four career paths, enabling them to carry up to 15 weapons, most of which are exclusive to their profession. Furthermore, as you\'re promoted, you\'ll enhance your arsenal with even stronger weapons, which then become available in multiplayer as well. Rifles, grenades, shrapnel mines, air strikes, gas grenades, rocket launchers, gun turrets, and cannons are just a few of the many, many weapons at your disposal. Adding to this diversity, the game\'s sound effects are just drop-dead funny. Similar to Worms, when one of the hogs attacks another, gets killed, or otherwise has something to say, they\'ll let loose with a witty catch phrase or retort. Hearing a pig utter ""This one\'s for Uncle fricken\' Sam"" with a Bronx accent is nothing short of sidesplitting.', ""Flat out, Hogs of War just isn't a game to respect for its single-player offerings. The pacing is such that only younger gamers will have the wherewithal to complete all six campaigns, and they'll likely have no interest in repeating the task once they've finished. However, the game's multiplayer aspects successfully redeem the game. With four people joining in, the number of onscreen explosions, pig-speech comments, and all-around nuttiness nearly lifts the game into the same sphere of quality as Worms or Bomberman. In short, if you own a Multitap, you could be in for some fun times.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Tomb Raider 2 Classic,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation']",{},"['When Tomb Raider came out near the end of 1996, it was considered by many to be fairly groundbreaking. It was, essentially, a combination of the classic Prince of Persia and an Indiana Jones movie. An ""attractive"" female character was tossed in, and the game sold like gangbusters. But more so than that, a virtual star was born. The game\'s main character, Lara Croft, broke out of the confines of the game industry, garnering mainstream press that no other game enjoyed. Tomb Raider II capitalizes on the hype (going so far as to say ""Starring Lara Croft"" on the box), and delivers a game that makes it seem like the developers were scared to mess with the formula of the original game. As a result, most of Tomb Raider II\'s improvements are cosmetic, and even those aren\'t really anything special. The graphics have been bumped up a bit, but the environments are still terribly pixelated. This is forgivable, however, considering the sheer size of some of the levels. The enemy characters are a bit smoother looking (and there are definitely more of them), but it\'s obvious that most of the development cycle was spent making Lara look better. This year\'s model is a lot more curvy, a bit skinnier, and sports a fully functioning ponytail (I shudder to think how many hours were spent getting her hair to move ""just right""). The gameplay hasn\'t changed much. Lara still has to do a lot of climbing and jumping, and the combat (complete with guns that you needn\'t bother aiming - just point in the general direction of a foe and pound the fire button until everything is dead) is still a complete joke. There are a lot more human enemies, which is definitely a welcome addition. Also, there are a few levels that have Lara get behind the wheel of a snowmobile or a boat. But other than that, it\'s more of the same old Tomb Raidin\'. Some of the level design (the Temple of Xian level, in particular) is pretty good, but some of the levels would have been better off in other parts of the game. The level order grinds the game to a halt on more than one occasion, the most notable being the Floating Islands level, which smacks of a hidden level, yet comes in towards the end of the game with no connection to any other level in the game. Personally, I think the Home Sweet Home level is the coolest, which puts you on the defensive against bad guys who are breaking into your house. It\'s really different and a cool way to end the game. Tomb Raider II turns the series into a license-based game, almost as if Lara Croft was the star of a movie, thrown into an uninspired game with hopes of making sales based on the name alone. If the original Tomb Raider wasn\'t enough to make you sick, Tomb Raider II picks up right where the first game left off. Public Enemy\'s Media Assassin, Harry Allen, perhaps said it best when he said, ""Don\'t believe the hype.""<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Your character is the aptly named Vampire Hunter D, a half-human, half-vampire who is hired to rescue a kidnapped child. The linear plot has three endings, each of which is triggered by meeting certain criteria.', ""Vampire Hunter D is an action-adventure game based on the novel written by Hideyuki Kikuchi, and the anime that followed. You take the role of a vampire hunter named D who is the offspring of a human and a vampire, who is hired to rescue a girl who's been kidnapped. The game is similar to Resident Evil, using polygons for the characters and prerendered graphics for the backgrounds. Gameplay and control are also quite similar, with the addition of a few extra moves. The main character can jump, guard, and strafe, which would seem like an advantage. But is it?  One of the main problems with the game is the control. The addition of jump, guard, and strafe functions may sound like a good idea, but it's actually the cause of the problem. First of all, you will come across places where you are required to jump. Since the background is a flat graphic, you'll have a hard time judging distances properly and may end up falling into a pit. You'll also meet enemies that fly, so naturally you will want your character to jump and attack them. Sometimes, you may want to be more aggressive and risk getting hit while attacking, but you'll find your character will often accidentally perform a backflip when you jump and you'll get hit. When you're not wielding a weapon, the control is exactly the same as in Resident Evil, but when you are wielding a weapon, the control changes, letting you strafe and circle strafe. Pressing the D-pad in battle causes you to face the enemy. So let's say you have your back turned to a monster. You would think you'd press forward to run away from him, but instead, hitting forward will cause you to turn and run at the enemy. The game's backgrounds get confusing easily, particularly when you're in a room with doors on all sides. This is more pronounced when you're fighting an enemy, as the camera angle might shift midfight, leaving you reeling. The running could also use some work. When you stop running, the character slides forward, which can mean the difference between life and death in certain situations."", ""The graphics in VHD are merely average. The CG movies are pretty amazing, although they don't stand up to the movies found in other PlayStation titles. The only detailed character is D himself, while the other characters and the enemies look a little blocky. The motion of D drawing and putting away his sword is good, but many other animations are poor. Likewise, the sounds are quite quirky. Some effects are really great, while others are just awful. The music department is really lacking, failing to set the mood and atmosphere properly. Even worse, the music actually suffers from slowdown in certain cutscenes. The game gives you the ability to skip some cutscenes, while others are required viewing. Strange."", ""Although the back of the box says the game has multiple scenarios, it really doesn't. The game has a linear plot and three endings, each of which is triggered by certain criteria met during your game. If you want to take a look at the different endings, all you have to do is start from a certain save point and just fulfill the criteria as you see fit. The game also says you can control another character named Leila, but you only get to do so for a very short while, sort of like when you controlled Ada or Carlos in the Resident Evil series. The gameplay time spent totals about ten hours - quite shorter time than you'd expect."", ""Overall, much like most other Resident Evil clones, the game just doesn't capture the magic of the Resident Evil series. Die-hard fans of the genre or the novel may find some value here, but not enough to warrant a purchase.<i>--Ike Sato</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Four nuclear warheads have been stolen by a terrorist organization; they have to be retrieved and the people responsible eliminated, and thus you must make your way from A to Z, hitting switches, opening doors, and laying waste to a near endless supply of henchmen.

Surprisingly for a console FPS, the joypad actually gives a tight, intuitive control (keyboard and mouse are also supported)."", ""There are drawbacks that stop this title short of greatness. The enemy AI is lacking and can result in soldiers standing motionless while their comrades are shot down around them. Slowdown does occur towards the end when the terrorists throw everything they have at you (including a helicopter gunship), and long loading times between levels don't help the cause either.

"NHL 2001 (PS2, REFURB)",,['NHL 2001'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation 2', 'Games']",{},"[""<I>NHL 2001</i> puts you on the ice, literally. Import your face (or perhaps your favorite celebrity's) onto the body of a customizable hockey player and then go on to create your team's logo, jersey, and color scheme. But this isn't just some dress-up game. This game sports the official NHL license, which means you've got access to the NHL's 30 traditional and expansion teams. In addition, there are 20 international clubs to play with. All teams have updated rosters that are looking to check, pass, and score their way toward the Stanley Cup. <I>NHL 2001</I> uses motion-capture technology to display the moves of professional players, as well as an improved artificial-intelligence system that continually recalculates the offensive and defensive strategies. In addition, each game features the play-by-play and commentary of veteran broadcasters Bill Clement and Jim Hughson. With five different play modes spanning quick play to career, <I>NHL 2001</i> is ready to take you on for either a short hustle or a long haul."", ""The majority of hockey games in the past have done an adequate job of re-creating the blazing speed of the NHL game while providing just enough visual cues to allow the player's imagination to fill in the rest. With the power of the PlayStation 2, things have suddenly shifted. No longer do players have to imagine what goes on behind the scenes. NHL 2001 ushers in a new era of hockey games, where the gritty moments are exposed and the classic war of attrition that is NHL hockey is blatantly displayed for all to see."", ""It wouldn't be an EA NHL game without a multitude of gameplay options, and NHL 2001 has plenty. You may play seasons, exhibition games with or against up to three friends, tournaments, and shootouts. If you're the type of person who likes to cut to the chase you can head straight to the playoffs on a quest for Lord Stanley's cup. It's hard to find another hockey game that has as many adjustable features as NHL 2001. Even the most miniscule of factors - such as pass speed, shot accuracy, puck elasticity, and believe it or not, puck friction - can be adjusted to your liking.  With all these options, it's puzzling why EA has decided not to include the franchise and challenge modes that have become commonplace in EA sports games. You may, however, create your own players, assign them abilities, and sign them up for season or exhibition play."", ""NHL 2001 is the most graphically advanced hockey game ever.  No other hockey game even enters the same solar system. The player models are so lifelike that it's almost scary. Each has an animated facial texture, complete with blinking eyes and a mouth that moves while yapping at the opposition or while celebrating after scoring plays. Players have gloves that can be removed to expose hands with five fingers and a helmet that they take off while they're on the bench. But what really brings NHL 2001 to life are the thousands of animation routines packed into the game.  The goalies sweep ice shavings out of the crease and pile them up on the posts, polygonal coaches bend down and whisper strategies into players' ears on the bench, and plenty of slashing and positioning takes place before each drop of the puck.  Players act completely independent of one another, so while one is scratching his head or adjusting his jersey, the others might be checking their stick blades for cracks or shaking their heads in disbelief. It goes a long way toward making the experience incredibly believable. Other small touches - like the goal light casting a red hue on the player jerseys, each game beginning with a camera shot from the tunnel, and the absolutely stunning reflections on the ice - take the levels of believability to dizzying heights. The only negative is a bit of slowdown that takes place while skating near the team benches, but it rarely hampers the gameplay experience."", ""While NHL 2001 has brought the series a long way in the graphics department, it still has some distance to go where gameplay is concerned. The pace of NHL 2001 seems slow and plodding on the default speed setting, but it may be adjusted to kick up the action a notch. Anyone who has a shortage of friends to play against may find NHL 2001 less than challenging. There are four difficulty settings, but even the all-star setting fails to require adept playing skills. The AI isn't particularly intelligent, as the computer refuses to dump the puck, even while playing with muck-and-grind teams like the Sharks or Flyers. The only noticeable differences between playing on rookie and all-star are how easily your players are knocked off the puck and how quickly the goalies flash the leather. When Jaromir Jagr gets separated from the biscuit after a slight brush with 5'6'' Theo Fleury, it becomes obvious that player attributes have been taken a bit too lightly. The referees might benefit from a pair of bifocals, as penalties are rarely called unless the sensitivity is set on maximum. On the positive tip, NHL 2001 contains plenty of control options, including a spin move, which helps a great deal in getting open shots while down low, and the big hit option, which sends players skidding across the ice. Players skate with a nice fluidity, and the transitions between moves are seamless. The only glaring omissions are drop passes, icon passing, and give-and-goes. Considering the past few installments of the franchise have included all of the above, it's safe to assume that EA simply ran out of time and made the visuals its top priority."", 'NHL 2001 delivers an excellent auditory experience as well. You can hear players scream after big plays and talk smack to one another in the faceoff circle. The organ sounds great, with specific songs for each team, and the announcers react to the on-ice action faster than ever before. The sound effects are sharp - raspy scraping sounds jump off the skates when edges are dug into the ice, and crowd reactions fire on cue.', ""It's obvious that EA's intent was to stun players with NHL 2001's graphics, and it has succeeded. There are so many shining moments during each game that the proverbial jaw drop is impossible to avoid. It will be interesting to see if EA can continue to up the ante in the graphics department in the coming years without sacrificing playability or frame rates. NHL 2001 is, without a doubt, the most visually stunning hockey game ever created. It dictates what all other next-generation hockey games have to live up to. While hard-core hockey types may eventually tire of the arcade-heavy gameplay, NHL 2001 is still a solid playing hockey game that will satisfy the needs of most players. Hopefully EA Sports will strive to make refinements so that the gameplay stands up to the lofty standards already set by the game's graphics. <br> <i>--Shane Satterfield</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc.

Tricks include front and backside grabs, flips, and twists--thousands of trick combinations are possible. Take to the slopes in locations in Canada, France, Japan, South America, Sweden, and the U.S. Choose from four professional riders and 20 authentic snowboards. Game modes include half-pipe, super-pipe, big air, and slopestyle events.', ""It's the third time around for Radical and its MTV series of PlayStation snowboarding games. While last year's effort, MTV: Snowboarding, is enjoyable for its depth of play, the game's graphics leave visual purists with a sense of yearning. This year, Radical has spruced up a few things, but basically, it has rolled out the same game. MTV: Pure Ride is an excellent snowboarding game, but it's yet another example of a development house shifting the majority of its resources to the next generation of hardware.  Like last year's game, Pure Ride is simply loaded with options. The core of the gameplay takes place in the tour challenge mode. Here you begin by picking one of five selectable characters and one of six boards to rip with. As you begin each event, you are faced with the challenge of placing first overall through three events: half-pipe, big air, and slopestyle. As you defeat each circuit, a new circuit opens. There are nine riders (including four real-world pros), 14 boards, and extra courses to unlock when you make it to the top of the leader board."", ""Pure Ride gives you ample chance to learn how to play. Before you hit the tour, you can polish your skills in the specialist or stunt modes. In the specialist mode you may practice the separate events that are commonplace on the tour. In each discipline you begin with a target score to reach. If you make the target, the next track becomes available. In the stunt mode you are faced with scenarios that gradually build in difficulty. It begins easily enough with a simple gap jump. But the testing quickly graduates to a sequence of rail tricks that must be performed error-free for you to advance. As if all these modes weren't enough, you may also cruise down any of the open courses at your leisure in the free-ride mode. Or if you've become tired of the courses that Radical provides, you may jump over to the build-a-mountain mode and set up your own personalized stunt course. Two players may also face off head-to-head in races down the open courses. While very few amendments have been added to the original formula of last year's game, Pure Ride's options definitely keep it real."", ""If you're looking for a pretty snowboarding game to impress your friends with, MTV Sports: Pure Ride shouldn't be on the top of your list. If you manage to stay on course and keep a good speed, nothing seems overly offensive. The impressively long field of vision lets you prepare for the terrain ahead as the draw-in is rarely noticeable. The animation of each trick is smooth, but the camera is so far panned out that it's often difficult to tell an indy grab from a mute or a stalefish from a backside."", 'It\'s when things slow down after a crash that Pure Ride\'s graphical imperfections become apparent. The scaling of some of the objects is surreal. The picnic tables look like they are meant for giants, and the buses placed for obstacles are larger than they should be. The tree sprites are a pixelated mess, and overall the texture quality is just a touch blurry. Normally the game hums along at a steady frame rate, but if you catch major air, which requires the game engine to draw a long distance, it\'s slideshow city. Your rider also has a tendency to ""teleport"" onto rails even though he may be several feet away, which can make for some awkward moments. The available tricks are also a bit puzzling. You may ollie up to rails and grind them, but performing board slides isn\'t possible. Even when it says you\'re performing a nose grind, it\'s impossible to distinguish it from any other sort of grind. There are special tricks unique to each rider that require insane amounts of hang time to pull off but are satisfying once you nail them down.', ""Pure Ride is no snowboarding simulation. Oftentimes when you're coming off a rail the computer will automatically eject you directly toward the next one. You get moving so fast down the mountain that you sometimes catch hundreds of feet of air off the smallest of hits. But if it's excitement you're looking for, Pure Ride has plenty to spare. Radical has set up the game so that if it's played correctly, it's a blast. Once you discover the timing needed to land each combination of tricks, the expansive courses open themselves up to getting burly. The courses are more than branching as they are full of new areas to discover. It's easy to find a new line each time down the hill while attempting to one-up your previous score.  Considering Pure Ride carries the MTV license, it's surprising that the game's soundtrack doesn't carry a group of A-list recording artists. Instead you get what is described as a compilation of some of the world's hottest up-and-coming bands. What you really get is a bunch of songs from groups that are still unearthing the mysteries of the bar chord. As you might expect, the majority of the music is grunge/rap rock, but there is one nice dub-influenced tune thrown in that truly reflects the snowboarding vibe. The sound effects get the job done: Digging your edges into the snow emits a raspy scrape while gently carving provides that wonderful whooshing sound that sings hard-core snowboarders to sleep at night."", ""While not necessarily a leap ahead of last year's release, MTV Sports: Pure Ride is a solid snowboarding game with enough options and tricks to keep you busy for weeks. The gameplay is fast and intuitive, and while the graphics aren't eye-popping, Radical has managed to capture what is most important in snowboarding games: the spirit of freedom.<i>--Shane Satterfield</i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc.

The game plays host to four events: Big Air, Border Cross, Halfpipe, and Slopstyle. If you aren't satisfied by the courses designed by professional snowboarders, then the course editor can be used to create your own unique path down the mountain. If you've ever seen coverage of the X Games on ESPN, you know what kind of crazy moves you'll have pull off to stay in front of the cameras past the first commercial break."", ""Konami's ESPN X-Games Snowboarding is closer to being a snowboarding simulation than any other game before. Fans of the sport will undoubtedly notice and appreciate all of the little extras, like the lounge in the lodge, ski lifts, and helicopter drops, which all add up to make the game completely realistic. Those who may be looking for another SSX will certainly be disappointed by X-Games' sim-styled approach, but those who are looking for a true-to-life snowboarding experience will be overjoyed."", ""The major difference between X-Games and SSX is that X-Games is based on reality. The game has real boarders, boards, goggles, pants, jackets, sponsors, music, physics, tricks, and just about anything else you can think of. In fact, you even have to earn a living in the game by making snowboarding runs while being filmed for snowboarding movies. When you're making the runs, you can play as one of or against 15 real-life boarders, including top names in the sport like Todd Richards, Jamie Lynn, Shannon Dunn, and Tina Basich. You can also make your own custom snowboarder and take him or her through a career, or you can just cut straight to the chase and tackle X-Game competitions like big air, slope style, and super pipe. The game also includes a no-frills mode where you can just simply board down an open mountain and do whatever you desire - no race, no points, no rules. The freedom and diversity of the modes included in the game easily make X-Games the most expansive and involving snowboarding game ever."", ""Controlling the action is easy since the game has a straightforward and fairly basic control setup. However, getting good to the point of being able to consistently land tricks and jumps is another story. The game's realistic physics make it hard to learn how to play, since you're consistently fighting your board's amazingly natural tendency to slip out from underneath your feet.  Learning not to fall is, of course, extremely important, since your career depends on it. Every time you fall when you're boarding on film, your pay gets reduced."", ""Visually, ESPN X-Games Snowboarding is a fairly average-looking PS2 title. The models used for the boarders are more than convincing, and they come with articulated facial features, smooth animations, and extremely realistic-looking gear. The terrain and objects like rocks and walls within the levels are wonderfully textured, which gives them a realistically lush and naturally variable look. The game's graphics as a whole aren't anywhere near as flashy as SSX's, but the style does tend to fit the game well."", 'In the audio department, ESPN X-Games Snowboarding delivers sound effects that help make the visuals more convincing and a soundtrack that makes the game more entertaining. The game features more than 14 different bands, ranging from punk to hip-hop, including bands like Goldfinger, Pepper, Long Beach Dub All Stars, and Strung Out. The real music gives the game a realistic edge, while the diversity in musical styles keeps the soundtrack fresh long after your first race.', ""In the end, ESPN X-Games Snowboarding is certainly a solid game that has all the elements of a good game. It's also the closest thing to a snowboarding simulation you'll find. Whether or not that's a good thing depends entirely on whether or not you're looking for a snowboarding game that has a steep learning curve, ultrarealistic physics, and career-management elements. ESPN X-Games Snowboarding is not a typical arcade-style snowboarding game like SSX. Both types of games have their pluses and minuses, which ultimately makes the decision of whether the game is right for you a personal one. So if you're thinking of picking this one up but just aren't sure you'll like it, rent it first and see for yourself. <br /> <i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc.

Get ready to compete against the world's greatest athletes--courtesy of Sony's Emotion Engine technology. The fluid motion and lifelike design of your competitors belie their computer origins. For example, the motion-capture animation of 100-meter-dash record breaker Maurice Greene ensures that his movements are realistic from the blocks to the tape. <I>ESPN Track &amp; Field</I>, like others in its series, includes a wide range of events, including the long jump, skeet shooting, weight lifting, and gymnastics. Players can compete as total athletes in the championship mode or go straight for their favorites in the single-event mode."", ""After publishing an array of Track & Field titles for Sony's PlayStation console, Konami puts its best foot forward with ESPN International Track & Field on the PlayStation 2. Utilizing the raw power of the PlayStation 2 hardware, the game leaps out with smooth 60fps visuals and a distinctly ESPN look, while also packing solid button-mashing gameplay. Grab your controller, a Multitap, and some friends - ESPN International Track & Field seeks to bring the thrill of competition into your home."", ""Initially, the game offers ten events: the 100-meter dash, 110-meter hurdles, long jump, pole vault, javelin throw, 100-meter freestyle swim, weight lifting, horizontal bar, trap shooting, and rhythmic gymnastics. However, success in these can unlock two additional events: the hammer throw and the high jump. There's a trial mode for practicing and a championship mode for competition, but additional mode selections and character options are nowhere to be found. If you desire a create-a-player mode or custom team options, you won't find them here. Oddly enough, while the PlayStation 2 version of the game adds the rhythmic gymnastics event, it also loses the women's vault from the Dreamcast version."", ""Despite minimal features, International Track & Field rocks in terms of gameplay. Adhering to the double-tap control mechanics that Konami pioneered in the 1980's, International Track & Field is easy to pick up, hard to master, and physically tiring. Every event, whether it involves running or strength building, uses repeated tapping of the X and circle buttons to increase onscreen speed or power meters. When the meters reach a certain level, the up and down digital pad buttons or the L1 button serve as action buttons, enacting the necessary array of jumps, throws, lifts, crouches, reloads, and swings required by the game's 12 events. Response is quick and precise, and the use of alternating button presses isn't frantic enough to lead to frustration. One thing is for sure - thanks to the game's more relaxed mashing mechanics, the PlayStation 2 version of International Track & Field is a bit less painful on the appendages than the Dreamcast edition."", ""Thanks to its intuitive control, International Track & Field's renditions of the 100-meter dash, long jump, freestyle swim, pole vault, and hammer throw are better and more realistic than those of any other modern track and field game. Of special mention are the horizontal bar and rhythmic gymnastic events, which require you to do Dance Dance Revolution-style timed button presses in order to perform gymnastics movements. Since there's no use of analog controls for timing, the javelin throw and triple jump events in the PlayStation 2 version are also much more enjoyable than those in the Dreamcast release. Other than a lack of things to do in single-player mode, ESPN International Track & Field excels at all of the events it aims to portray."", ""In terms of visuals, the PS2 release of ESPN International Track & Field improves upon the Dreamcast release in most areas.  Utilizing the PlayStation 2's additional horsepower, the game's stadiums, fields, and arenas are teeming with a plethora of minute details, such as blowing flags, flowing clouds, and Diamond Vision screens. Actually witnessing singular spectators moving about is rather impressive. The on-field visuals are crisp, never distracting, and always put the athlete at the center of attention. Konami motion-captured real Olympic hopefuls for the game, and it shows. The way each athlete walks, warms up, and moves in flight exudes an amazing sense of realism. Through an increased number of camera angles, a slick interface, and vibrant status indicators, the PlayStation 2 release also better conveys the trademark feel of an ESPN broadcast, at times resembling something you'd stumble across on ESPN2 at three in the afternoon. On the downside, though, the texture diversity is sometimes less than that of the Dreamcast version, and there is some visible jaggedness during the javelin, hammer throw, and running events."", ""Although the game takes advantage of the PlayStation 2's horsepower visually, it errs on the side of utilitarianism when it comes to sound. Each event has the requisite grunts, groans, footsteps, and landing effects one expects from an athletic competition game, but nothing in the way of environmental noise.  Some background music or in-event stadium noise would have been nice, although hearing grown men groan, grunt, and strain is nevertheless pleasing."", ""As the PlayStation 2's only current track and field game, International Track & Field is an excellent first attempt. Future releases will hopefully improve upon the situation with more events and diverse character creation features, but this release is remarkably sufficient. Despite a few rough edges, Konami has nailed it when it comes to gameplay and fun. <br> <i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Age of Sail II,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<I>Age of Sail II</I> simulates naval warfare from 1775 to 1820 with a real-time 3-D sailing and combat model. Over 1,200 historical ships and 100 historical American and British scenarios are available, including: Copenhagen, the Battle of the Nile, Trafalgar, Cape St. Vincent, and Camperdown. A full, floating 3-D camera allows complete control of your fleet, and the 3-D accelerated graphics reveal accurately rendered ships and beautiful landscapes.', 'The original <i>Age of Sail</i> was released in 1996, as one of the first Windows 95 games. The latest incarnation of this 18th-century realtime naval wargame has many improvements over the original, from beautiful high-res graphics and fluid ship movement to more realistic crew assignments. This game is trying to set the new standard for the genre, with over 100 historical scenarios, campaign play, and multiplayer options. Sadly though, all these accomplishments are marred by the fact that the game was forced out the door far too soon and contains crippling bugs.After a long drought, <i>Age of Sail II</i> from Talonsoft is a new realtime wargame set in the historic 18th century, simulating the great naval crashes of 11 different nations. From the established nations such as England, France and Spain to the fledgling America, players are offered a wide array of historical or hypothetical scenarios as 16-person multiplayer LAN or Internet games or single-player campaigns. Once the game starts, the player is placed in charge of anywhere from one to more than 30 ships, ranging from lithe 16-gunners to massive 150-gun man-of-wars, all in eye-popping realtime 3D.', 'The first thought upon firing up the game is simply how good it looks and sounds. The music is a series of rousing ""High Seas"" orchestral pieces and the menus are appropriate to the age in question. After choosing the mode of play, a detailed list of ships and historical background is shown, and one last click starts the engagement. The battle takes place from 800x600 to 1600x1200 resolution, with a free-roaming camera looking upon an ocean with bucking ships and a rising sun. The ships themselves show detail down to the crew walking along the top decks and the deteriorating sails.', 'The interface consists of a series of pop-up windows, which can be moved around freely or hidden. An overhead map gives you the layout, a ship menu shows the combatants with a thumbnail of their statistics, and another small window allows the player to set different sails and call up the formation window. Game speed can be set by means of a slider on another window that also helps with several overlays like gun arcs and range. Primary control of your ship is accomplished through a detailed window called the helm. On the helm is a circle showing the present direction of the ship in relation to wind direction, and a rotating arrow that is the direction the ship is trying to reach. As one would expect, smaller ships can turn a lot faster than large ones.', ""As a ship becomes damaged, the hull, sails and guns also take damage. The surviving crew can be set to work fixing the damage and assisting in putting out fires and unfouling a ship that got too close to another. For ships that get too close and have their rigging foul or use grappling hooks, boarding parties may be formed so marines can try and take an enemy ship by force. Once a ship gets down to a critical level in hull integrity, it will strike its colors and surrender. Though ships will lose masts, it's rare for them to take so much damage that they actually sink."", 'To assist in dealing with many ships, the player can assign waypoints for ships to follow, either singly or in groups, and formations to maintain their relative positions. Ships can easily be added in or taken out of hot-keyed groups. Also, three levels of posture can be set, from aggressive to defensive, so the player can concentrate on matters elsewhere.', 'With all this going for game, it has serious problems. The first and most glaring of these setbacks is the state of the manual. Weighing in at 32 pages, only about two-thirds of the small booklet actually describes the game, most of which is merely covering the basics of the interface. No sense of the history is included, and there are no notes on period tactics to help players new to the genre. Of course, there is the ad for the official strategy guide taking up a page in the back.', ""Once the game starts up, another problem becomes apparent; the game was rushed out the door before it was finished. From random lockups when loading to a litany of missing features too numerous to list completely, it's obvious that <i>Age of Sail II</i> was released in a beta state. A few of the more annoying bugs are the inability to fix guns, the inability to board another ship even if snared and grappled, and questionable formations that only sometimes work as advertised. After a certain point, the missing features begin to drag down gameplay."", 'To add to that mess, the computer AI is weak and has no problem firing through friendly ships to get at an enemy. The AI will gladly pour fire into surrendered ships that are effectively out of the fight, and has a blind spot for land. Since many of the scenarios take place along exotic coasts, this shortsightedness on the part of the computer normally spells disaster. Turning both sides to AI control, one can watch two neat lines of ships sail right into the coast, as if trying to stop off at a nearby town.', 'It must be noted that Talonsoft and developer Akella are making great strides in order to fix the game up, and one major patch has already been issued. Until the game works as advertised, though, only the most dedicated fans of the scene need apply.', '<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Until the game is at least one more major patch from Version 1.01, the gameplay has very glaring problems, and the title is best passed over. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>']","by

The PC version of <I>Metal Gear</I> is just as good as you\'d expect a PlayStation-to-PC port of an awesome game to be, with few of the drawbacks. At its core, <I>MGS</I> is still a great game, but if you\'ve already played and beat both the full game and the follow-up, <I>VR Missions</I>, there\'s not much in this package to recommend to you. If you\'re one of those hardcore ""PC Only!"" types that don\'t own a console, you\'ll definitely want to shell out the 35 smackers for this baby in order to find out just what the hell everyone was talking about two years ago.In 1998, <I>Metal Gear Solid</I> turned the console world upside down. Intense gameplay, great graphics (for the PlayStation) and a cinematic quality previously unseen in the console realm made it one of the most talked about and played games of that year. Chances are that if you didn\'t play the game then, you\'re probably not really interested in it now. We\'re foreseeing three types of people buying this game: everyone who could never make Bleem! work properly, puzzled PC gamers who want to see what all the fuss was about and gamers who have lost, tossed or broken their PlayStations. <P>Just in case you live under a rock and haven\'t heard of the game, the story follows Solid Snake, an unusually named government agent called in from the cold in order to infiltrate an Alaskan military base taken over by a terrorist group. The terrorists turn out to be genetically altered super-soldier types, just like our boy Snake -- in fact, several of them are actually from his old unit. Snake begins his quest by swimming inside an old subpen and must make his way through the base on his way towards an ultimate confrontation with the leader of the terrorist group. The <I>VR Missions</I> is a whole \'nother story. The cinematic nature of the game is tossed out in favor of small, arcade-like missions that are essentially stand-alone puzzles. It may sound dumb, but the missions are somewhat addictive due to their fast-paced nature; you\'ll find the refrain ""Just one more try"" escaping your lips more than a few times.<P>Although you\'ll have the opportunity to lob grenades, fire machineguns and launch shoulder-mounted Stinger missiles, <I>Metal Gear Solid</I>\'s gameplay is centered on stealth rather than straight-up, guns-blazin\' action. The player\'s attention is usually drawn to the radar screen at the top right-hand corner of the screen, which will not only show enemy soldier and camera movements, but will also relay to the player the line of the enemy or camera\'s sight. The player needs to sneak around the perimeter of the enemy view, without triggering the horrible trumpet-blare of an alarm and swarms of suddenly alerted guards. Of course, if the guards do close in, Snake can always break out the hardware and snipe, blast or choke \'em into submission. <P>The PC version of <I>MGS</I> does have a few things to recommend it to hungry gamers. This version is actually both the full version of <I>Metal Gear Solid</I> and the <I>VR Missions</I>, which were released separately (look at it as getting two games for the price of one). Gamers can also sneak through the game in first-person mode. This may sound much more attractive to us PC types than the standard third-person view, but the truth is that the game is actually easier to play with the camera pulled back, rather than looking through the eyes of Solid Snake. <P>The biggest change to <I>MGS</I> comes in the game\'s actual presentation. Those of us blessed with rockin\' rigs can crank up the game\'s resolution to 1024x768. This makes the game look much sharper and nicer, but it also reveals that the PC porting crew did nothing in the way of touching up the low-res PlayStation textures. Faces are indistinct and large textures are very blocky, simply rendered with a higher pixel count. It would have been nice if the game\'s textures had been cleaned up for this PC presentation, but this would probably be way too much to ask for from a Japanese developer. That being said, <I>MGS</I> does look nicer than many of the other console-to-PC games we\'ve seen (anything from Infogrames or Capcom, for instance).<P>The minor additions to the game -- the inclusion of the <I>VR Missions</I> ""expansion pack,"" the ability to play the whole game in first-person mode and the ability to crank up the resolution level to 1024x768 -- may not warrant gamers world-wide to beat down retailers\' doors to pick this game up, but if you haven\'t tried <I>MGS</I> or have a hankerin\' to relive 1998\'s best console game, definitely grab this one. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>']","by

Slingo (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['I want you to know that I take bingo seriously. As a child, nothing thrilled me more than singing the song all the way through (_ _ _ G O was my favorite part - \'cause it spelled ""GO!""). As I grew older, I became acquainted with the more adult pastime at our annual family reunion, held at a ranch/resort in Santa Barbara, Calif. Every Friday night, all the guests gather in the rec room and guard their dollar cards jealously in the hopes of winning a T-shirt, cap, or $10 cash prize. I\'ve never seen so many Mercedes-driving, fur-coat-wearing people get so excited about winning a baseball cap. <P> The idea of bingo as a single-player computer game seriously confuses me. Since I believe in my heart of hearts that the entire object of bingo (the game, not the song) is to win money, it\'s hard to get excited about ""winning"" on my PC (no crisp big-headed 20s have emerged from my A: drive yet). But Hasbro Interactive makes a compelling case in its promotional material. Slingo isn\'t just bingo, you see. It\'s ""The Addictive Combination of SLOTS and BINGO!"" How, you may ask, is this remarkable feat achieved? Well, the slot machine produces the numbers, much like the perky sailing instructor pulls the multicolored Ping-Pong balls out of the air popper in that excitement-filled rec room. <P> Let me see if I can explain it a little better. When you start up a game of Classic Slingo, you are presented with a 5X5 bingo card. At the bottom, a row of numbers is generated randomly when you pull the slot-machine arm (called a spin). You match these numbers with your bingo card numbers. The object of the ""game"" is to cover all 25 squares within 20 spins. You\'re awarded points instead of money. Each match garners points. Completing rows (called Slingos) gets you extra points. Clearing the entire board gives you a further point bonus. <P> The most fun part of Slingo is picking your background. You can choose from caveman, space, art deco, laboratory, nature, fantasy, and ocean. The cute dragons in the fantasy background breathe fire when you spin. <P> Sometimes when you pull the arm, you get coins instead of a number. This gives you more points. In case you find matching the numbers too difficult, most every pull produces one or more jokers. Jokers can cover any square. If you\'re unlucky, a devil will appear and cut your points in half. In case you think this too harsh, most of the time, an angel will appear and relegate the devil to a puff of smoke, letting you keep your points. Intimidated by the number-matching component? Don\'t be. You can\'t go on to the next spin until all your matches are made. <P> In case you get bored with Slingo and feel tempted to play another game that engages your brain and requires some skill, there are a couple variations. Mixed Matrix Slingo is exactly the same as Classic Slingo except that the numbers generated by the spin can be anywhere on the board. Super Squares Slingo adds randomly placed squares that give you extra points when you match them. Finally, Giant Slingo adds a giant to the items that get generated by each spin. When you get a giant, you get an extra spin. <P> Hmmm, perhaps a spoiler alert is in order. <P> After playing for ten minutes, my number-matching skills had been honed razor-sharp. I felt ready to take on the ultimate challenge - Duel Slingo. Before venturing into the scary, cutthroat world of online Slingo, I thought it prudent to practice against the computer. As you might guess, in this ""highly competitive version of Classic Slingo, both players play on the same card!"" The 20 arm-pulls are divided between the two players. Each player gets points for matches, including Slingos, and coins. Watch out for the pesky devil, though. If you spin him, you lose half your points. <P> Unlike chess, checkers, mah-jongg, or any number of two-player classic or board games, there is absolutely no skill involved whatsoever. The numbers are already placed on the 5X5 card. The spins produce random numbers. There\'s no hope of applying a strategy. It\'s pure luck - and, of course, your ability to match two numbers. <P> Imagine my surprise when my boss told me that Slingo is the most popular game on America Online. I can certainly see its appeal. It\'s seriously simple. Each game takes less than five minutes to play. The backgrounds are brightly colored. Umm, did I say it was simple? My forays into the Slingo play area produced nothing more than a zillion proposals of marriage and several compelling business propositions. I won a few games; I lost a few games. And I\'m still waiting for those big-heads to start spewing out my A: drive. <i>--Nicole Freeman</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Diablo 2  - Mac,,[],"['Video Games', 'Mac', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""In <I>Diablo 2</I>, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world of <I>Diablo 2</I>, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time."", ""Several changes have been made in the general gameplay of Diablo. The first thing you'll notice is the new interface. The familiar balls of health and mana frame the interface, but now more of the screen is devoted to the game. The text window in the middle of the screen is gone. Now, dialogue from NPCs appears over the respective NPC's head, and item descriptions and text also appear over objects. <P> Another new addition is the stamina bar. One big gameplay change is the ability to run. Now, you can run, but only for limited durations. When you do run, the stamina bar slowly depletes. When it runs out, you need to rest until it starts to fill up again. There will be items and spells that increase your stamina, but running will always be a limited ability. Although running obviously allows you to travel faster, it will leave you more vulnerable to attack, although you can go from run to attack seamlessly, as there is no pause between the two actions. <P> Moving around in Diablo has been improved in other ways as well. To cut down on the tediousness of walking back and forth between cleared-out areas and town, Blizzard North has added waypoints to the game. <P> However, these aren't waypoints in the real-time strategy sense. These waypoints are more like teleportation spots, quick portals between two or more locations in the same act. Each town has a waypoint, and various locations around the wilderness also have waypoints. You won't be able to use a waypoint until you've actually visited it once, and you won't be able to jump through it until you have touched at least two, since this is not a one-way travel system to explore the map. Instead, it's a convenience for moving about already explored areas. <P> The actual development of your character is also different. You now purchase skills via skill points each time you advance a level. In addition, the skill sets of each character are really differentiated, so that the abilities of the characters do not overlap. One other note about character development is that dying causes you to lose experience points. The designers wanted to make death something you would want to avoid even more , so they added experience loss in addition to equipment loss. However, you'll never lose enough experience to drop a level. <P> Not only is development different, but the classes are different as well. There are now five characters to choose from when you play: amazon, barbarian, necromancer, paladin, and sorceress. Each has his or her own strengths and weaknesses, although all should be very different and enjoyable to play. One of the key reasons why Diablo II looks like it will have immense replay value is because of the great differences between classes. <P> Amazon: A good all-around class with some spell use and special physical attacks. She is best with the bow, but also good with the spear and javelin, excelling in long-range attacks. <P> Barbarian: A powerful brute bereft of magic but possessed of potent combat skills. He is the only character that can wield two weapons at once; and this ability is available from level one! <P> Necromancer: A weak character who can command undead minions to aid him. His spells let him animate the dead and enhance their strength. He has some offensive magic. <P> Paladin: This warrior is second in physical strength and the best defensive fighter. He has healing and defensive spells to go with his powerful melee attacks. <P> Sorceress: She is also a weak fighter but possesses the most powerful magic arsenal, complete with fire, cold, and lightning spells. <P> The new trading menu is a big improvement over Diablo, where you had to dump your items on the ground and hope the other player paid you. Now, when you click on another player, you are requesting a trade. If he agrees, a trading window pops up, where you can place your items for trade and he can place his compensation. You both click when you are ready to finalize the transaction. It is not unlike the trading window for EverQuest. <P> Another new feature we noticed but that took us a while to comprehend was the socket items. You'll find weapons, shields, and helms in the game that have sockets in them. You'll also find gems in rare instances in caves and off of dead monsters' bodies. These gems can be placed in the sockets to convey special powers in the items, like the Materia system in Final Fantasy VII. A topaz, for instance, adds lightning damage if you place it in a weapon, but adds lightning resistance if you put it in armor. In our short time playing, we've already seen several different gems, including sapphires, emeralds, diamonds, and jeweled skulls. This adds yet another element to the already rich plethora of items you can find in the game. <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

In <i>Soldier of Fortune Gold</i> you play a merciless mercenary tracking a fanatical terrorist organization through over 30 deadly missions. Through sabotage, assassinations, and daring assaults, you must eliminate them before they eliminate you.', ""The game features all of the explosive, first-person shooter action of the original <i>Soldier of Fortune</i> and adds more than 15 new multiplayer levels, new team modes, and character models. Also, the new bot feature will play the game for you while you're offline! (For ages 17 or older)"", 'This is the <i>Quake II</i> engine? One almost can\'t tell. It may not have <i>Q3A</i>\'s curvy surfaces, but the textures, art and animations have been so improved that we almost forgot that the game is essentially running on three-year-old technology. Raven has once again taken id\'s core code, improved upon it and added more fun than Carmack and crew have put into their last two games combined. Plus, there are explosions, big guns and lots and lots of bloody, gibbed bodies. What more could you ask for in a FPS?John Mullins is a man\'s man (not in that way, ya perv). He has a gritty voice that\'s always pitched just above a low growl, the kind of voice that seems to say ""Mind if I smoke"" in a way that indicates that he really doesn\'t care if you do. He\'s a tough-as-nails former Green Beret with three tours of The Nam under his belt, as well as several ""advisory"" positions in fun places like Central and South America and the Middle East. We\'re not even going to make jokes about Mr. Mullins for fear that one night when we least expect it, we\'ll turn on the lights when we get home and <i>he\'ll be sitting right there</i>, with a Bowie knife gripped between his teeth and a dead look in his eyes.', ""Where <i>Soldier of Fortune</i> the game differs from <i>Soldier of Fortune</i> the magazine is that Mr. Mullins is now a stone-cold hero. Sure, he's making money for the missions he undertakes, but the cash is almost an afterthought. We don't want to spoil the game experience, but all the money a player earns doesn't seem to do squat, except as a nice virtual lump sum sitting in the virtual bank awaiting a player's virtual retirement. What is important is that Mullins is ready, willing and able to trot across the face of the globe on a tireless search for new bad guys to shoot up."", ""For all its real-world trappings, <i>Soldier of Fortune</i> is much closer to action movie than actual maneuvers. The weapons are mostly realistic (until the last couple of levels), but the damage taken by the player versus the amount handed out brings to mind great moments in Schwarzenegger history. Players dart into rooms full of banana-republic soldiers and hold down the trigger while madly strafing right and left. Miraculously, enemy fire is both poorly aimed and of smaller caliber, while the player's rounds explodes heads, saws off legs and blows weapons out of the enemies' hands. Think of the scene in <i>Predator</i> where Arnie and pals stroll into the Central American camp and begin blowing the crap out of everything and then walk away with hardly a scratch. That's the essence of <i>Soldier of Fortune</i>."", ""Players are limited in the number of saves they have, which cuts down on the boring save-every-five-feet mentality that's all too easy to slip into. Like Half-Life, <i>SoF</i> will autosave at the beginning of each new level, so the player can restart without fear of being penalized for forgetting to save during the game. Enemy fire doesn't do that much damage to the player (unless they score a headshot or you catch a rocket in the gut at point-blank range), but it does add up over time."", ""There's a decent armory to be raided as players trample through the levels. The default weapon is a Bowie knife that's unbeatable at close range; switch to this puppy in a tight room full of bozos with pistols and shotguns, and it'll be cleared out faster than a Ginsu can cut through a watermelon <i>or</i> a can. There are two pistols: the Black Panther -- a Glock-style 9 millimeter -- and the Silver Talon -- a Desert Eagle .50 that's great for close-in work. The Berserker is the requisite shotgun, a standard 8-round room-sweeper. There are three machineguns, including the Bulldog, a light, silenced Mac-11 clone; the Raptor, which fires the same NATO rounds used in M16s or Colt Commandos; and the Guardian, a heavy machinegun that also chunks out white phosphorous grenades. There's also a bolt-action sniper rifle that positively sucks if not being used through the alt-fire telescoping sight."", 'After these normal weapons, <i>Soldier of Fortune</i> begins to get a bit kooky. There\'s a box-style rocket launcher that holds four rockets that can be fired singly or in one huge, messy batch. As so many others have before (<i>Kingpin</i>, <i>Aliens Vs. Predator</i>) , Raven tries its hand at a first-person flamethrower, with similarly unimpressive results. The Heavy Hitter is a sci-fi slugthrower that utilizes ""gyro-jet"" technology, which proves to be almost worthless against anyone with armor. But of all the crazy weapons, the award for weirdest goes to the Microwave Pulse gun, which fires either a taserlike stream of energy that slowly cooks its target or a larger single blast of energy that causes an enemy to plump as you cook \'em. For some reason, these heavy weapons weren\'t as satisfying to use as the more realistic lighter weapons were; the slugthrower and the Microwave gun were particularly farfetched and seemed out of place with the rest of the game.', 'All this weaponry is responsible for producing <i>Soldier of Fortune</i>\'s most controversial feature: the superrealistic, over-the-top gore. When we saw the game at E3 last year for the first time, it was quietly being shown behind closed doors (well, closed drapes, to be more accurate), to avoid potential media backlash following the Columbine tragedy. A smart move on Activision\'s part, because the early versions of <i>SoF</i> were so blood-soaked it was enough to surprise even the most stoic of viewers. Limbs flew with every blast, heads exploded with huge sprays of blood and gray matter and every gutshot left hanging entrails and ripped chunks of flesh behind. The game is still pretty gruesome (still lots of flying arms and legs and exploding skulls), but it has been somewhat toned down. This is definitely an ""M"" game, no doubt about it, but <i>SoF</i> has been downgraded from Peter Jackson\'s <i>Dead Alive</i> to Peter Jackson\'s <i>The Frighteners</i> in terms of splat factor. In recent weeks, Activision even announced that they would sell a special, less violent ""Tactical"" version of the game. Both versions will have parental lockout features to scale down or eliminate the gore to keep little Johnny safe from the potentially life-altering traumas of witnessing a computer game character\'s noggin burst open.', ""As in an action movie, there's never much threat of the hero running out of ammo. Mullins can reload faster than a frat boy can chug a Mickey's Big Mouth, slapping a new magazine into his Raptor or racking shells into his Berserker in no time flat. Downed enemies leave ammo and armor behind, and the various locales that players stalk through are chock full of medkits, grenades and extra weapons. Unlike most FPS heroes, Mullins can only hold a limited number of toys, having to discard artillery in order to upgrade to newer, bigger guns midlevel. Grenades and flash packs become a fairly important part of the game, especially in multiplayer, and they're so powerful that it was smart of Raven to limit the number a player can hold."", ""<i>SoF</i>'s AI calls to mind the henchmen of every Bond villain to ever grace the silver screen. They're none too bright and tend to rush towards Mullins in wave after lemminglike wave, seemingly unconcerned by the growing piles of corpses littering the ground nearby. We've said it before and we'll say it again: When you shoot a man in the head with a sniper rifle, the guy standing right next to him should react in some way, preferably by running for cover. The basic enemy reaction to the player's arrival on scene is to begin shooting and running straight at him. There are a few occasions when enemies will be placed behind obstructions, but players can usually take out these barricaded goons one at a time by using the lean buttons (a la <i>Thief</i>) to poke the sniper rifle around a corner."", 'There is a bit of a random element to the enemy placement, which is nice. Dilly-dally too long and enemies will respawn. We like this feature, because it seems odd when a huge terrorist base is cleaned out, leaving the player to walk around empty hallways. Make too much noise, as indicated by the noise meter at the bottom of the screen, and a new horde of enemies will rush into the room and begin shooting up the place. Exercise caution when tossing grenades or firing the heavy machinegun, or expect to make new friends.', ""We do like the way the <i>Quake II</i> engine has been massively overhauled for <i>Soldier of Fortune</i>, including tossing the software engine altogether (this game runs only on 3D accelerators). Raven is well known for its excellent reworking of id's engines, and this game is no exception. Even dedicated fans (like us) have to admit that <i>Half-Life</i> is beginning to look kinda dated, but <i>SoF</i> looks clean and slick, especially in 32-bit color. The one thing that did annoy us on a few levels was Raven's fogging, which is so heavy in certain areas (especially in snowy outdoor levels) that players can hardly see."", ""Raven's GHOUL modeling system is ultracool, allowing the designers to place objects like sunglasses, helmets, hats, weapons, armor or outfits on models (which can also be shot off), slightly altering the look of each base unit so players don't feel as if they're fighting an endless sea of clones. Each model also has a number of damage points and states, and will react depending upon how and where they are shot. Shoot a guy in the leg with a pistol and he might try to limp away, or will hold the injured limb and hop about like a maroon for a moment. Blast him close range with the shotgun and watch his arm blow off. Score a headshot with the sniper rifle and see his head disappear in a cloud of blood. Weapons can be shot out of hands, helmets can be popped off heads, and tanks of fuel for flamethrowers can be detonated in spectacular fireballs that will take out anyone standing nearby. It's cool to spray bullets into a room full of enemies only to see each one react differently."", 'Multiplayer is pretty fun; it\'s a fast and furious affair, and smart players will bind the grenade key to an easily accessible button. While getting shot in <i>SoF</i> deathmatch is a lot more damaging than in <i>Quake III</i> or <i>Unreal Tournament</i>, it\'s nowhere near <i>Rainbow 6</i>\'s one-shot-one-kill philosophy. Unless you switch the MP mode to ""Realistic,"" that is, where kills rack up as fast as the player can aim and squeeze. <i>SoF</i> also has Capture the Flag, Arsenal (use all your weapons to score a kill) and Assassin (hunt down a specific player) modes. We didn\'t really dig Arsenal -- too much thinking -- but Assassin proved to be a particularly fun mod in a sneaky-bastard way.', ""All in all, <i>Soldier of Fortune</i> is a good game, with plenty of gameplay and gore to hold FPS fans' attention. There are in-engine cutscenes at the beginning and end of each level, but the story elements are pretty sparse (this is a mercenary game, after all) in comparison to <i>Thief II</i> or even <i>Half-Life</i>. At least there is a single-player, offline game, unlike so many of the other FPS games we've seen lately (yeah, we're talking to you, id and Epic). Players may blow their way through the single-player game in a few days, but the multiplayer component appears to extend the life of the game somewhat. We recommend this game for hardcore shooter fans with iron stomachs. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>""]","by

Kessen happens to be somewhat of an exception."", 'Kessen, roughly translated as ""Decisive Battle,"" is a strategy-simulation game based on the samurai era in Japan.  Although some of the elaborate costumes are fictional, the plot and setting for the most part are true to the history books. You initially take the role of Ieyasu Tokugawa, leading your troops to battle against Mitsunari Ishida (whom you can play as once you finish the game). Watching a brief summary of the first battle at the start of the game is like watching a documentary. The narration and presentation are superb and very reminiscent of an actual Japanese television show. A real-time cutscene then shows Ieyasu and his generals discussing battle strategy.', ""The game progresses in real time as you control a group of armed troops led by a general and face a similar group. Your general's decisions are AI based, and while the game is in progress a tutorial can be displayed to help explain the game system. In the later half of the game, you take control of your troops and make your own decisions. It is easier to pick up the control at that point since the enemy forces have been thinned out enough for you to finish the job."", ""When you're engaged in battle, the triangle button lets you switch from the field map to the battle view. First it shows an overview of the battlefield, with all the troops shown from far away. You can use the D-pad to move the cursor to particular areas of the battlefield and then hit the triangle button to zoom in on the area to show the troops battling against each other in real time. You can also switch to different areas by using the L1 and R1 shoulder buttons. Aside from the normal attack, you can execute special battle tactics, which range from making your cavalry charge, to shooting cannons, to even performing a dance to taunt enemy troops. There are also occasions when the generals of each cavalry will duke it out one-on-one, or a general will run across the battlefield swinging his ax-spear, hacking dozens of enemies.  Although giving commands on the field map can be quite boring, it pays off when you can see the battles up close. Koei has definitely made use of the hardware capabilities of the PlayStation2 here - you will see hundreds of troops on one battlefield, and you can view them up close in real time."", ""There are not enough voice-overs during gameplay, but the cutscenes have much more speech, which balances the game out. The dialogue is very witty and sharp (from a Japanese historical point of view, that is). The soundtrack is so amazing - even if you weren't watching the game, the music alone could bring the epic battles to mind. The sound effects are also realistic, but unfortunately the graphics don't always match the high marks achieved by the sound. Seeing hundreds of soldiers in one battlefield is indeed an accomplishment and a good use of the PS2 hardware, but there are some details that can't be ignored. There is no blood in the game at all. Sometimes, the cutscenes really have very good animation, but not seeing blood when one soldier slashes another is pretty unrealistic. After playing the first few missions, you might even find the battle animation to be a little redundant. It may be captivating the first few times, but you'll probably get to a point where you'll want to skip the animations. Although the gameplay may become redundant, there are different scenarios, depending on your loss or victory during a battle - which also means straying from the history-based storyline. You will also be able to play as Mitsunari Ishida after you finish the game once and experience a different point of view of the story. So, in that sense, there is a decent amount of replay value in the game."", 'Japanese history buffs will definitely love this game, and even novice players will appreciate the game, with its stunning visuals and sounds. The only question is whether you are willing to sit down and play the game, with its continuously redundant nature.<i>--Ike Sato</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Swing Away Golf - PlayStation 2,,"['SWING AWAY GOLF - PLAYSTATION PS2, RFRB']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation 2', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['PlayStation2 ~ Swing Away Golf', '""It\'s only a golf game. It\'s only a golf game."" Keep chanting that, because prolonged exposure to T&amp;E Soft\'s Swing Away Golf (called Golf Paradise in Japan) will make your friends think you have gone off the deep end. With a development team populated by the same folks who created Hot Shots Golf, the game features more of what golf fans have come to expect: more courses, more clubs, more match types, more upgrades, and more secrets than you can shake a club at.', ""Seconds after powering up the game, you have access to your choice of seven golfers and a few basic play options: tutorial, one on one stroke play, and tournament play. You can view your trophies, clubs, and prize winnings also, but without earning a few accoutrements, these menu items are better left for future perusal. With the depth of gameplay in Swing Away Golf, sitting through the tutorial is a good idea. You'll have to master club choice, stance, aiming, putting, pitching, wind resistance, slice, and a litany of other golf nuances. The most important of these facets has to do with the swing meter, a curvy dial of devastation that replaces Hot Shots' stripe indicator. Links and PGA players will know it well. For power, press the button to increase the meter along the dial and press again to stop on the desired distance level. For accuracy, let the meter fall and press the button when it's in one of the curve's three zones. If you're too early, the shot will land a few yards short. If you're too late, the shot will overshoot the suggested mark or die mere yards from where you stand. Though the prospect of gaining such knowledge is daunting, the developers of Swing Away Golf have encased the game with plenty of quirky characters and interwoven plot points. It is the unspoken successor to Hot Shots 2 after all, so it has to be somewhat entertaining."", ""Initially, the difficulty level seems high, but after an hour or so, the learning curve drops greatly - especially due to your ability to power-up your player. A few minor qualms exist with the difficulty of driving the ball, but the importance of this will vary from person to person. Deepening the game's replay value, success in competition modes can unlock a variety of secrets, such as new clubs, hidden players, more courses, skill points, and extra game modes. Furthermore, since all ten of the game's characters vary in innate skills and personalities, there's even an incentive to try out every golfer. Combine this with four-player capability, a random course generator, and comprehensive month-by-month stat tracking, and Swing Away Golf might be the best semisimulation of golf ever executed.Visually, Swing Away Golf makes ample use of the PS2's graphical capabilities. Ponds and water hazards undulate and ripple as if the wind were really affecting them. Leaves and trees blow softly, while the flag on the pin sways ever so slightly in the breeze. Though the cut of the grass and location of tree hazards are present on the course map, the game's sheer graphical crispness makes them visible from the play screen as well. For a closer look, the dual shock analog sticks allow real-time panning and zooming across the course. The game's visuals even enhance the gameplay, as the putting graph adds a high level of control vs. Hot Shots 2's lackluster putting experience. Wrapping it up, the superdeformed character models are well drawn and amusingly animated, and they flow as freely as 60 frames per second allows. While no single graphical nuance is strikingly impressive, the game's overall production values are exceptional."", ""Truthfully, it almost feels traitorous to find a drawback to any aspect of Swing Away Golf, but if there is a complaint to be found, it's in the sound. Background music is fittingly serene, but there's just not enough variety to it. Sure, each mode has a couple background tunes, but considering that your average golf match takes around 30 minutes, any single song gets old quickly. On the other hand, sound effects are plentiful, crisp, and dripping with quality. From the unmistakable sound of graphite clubs striking a golf ball to the ball rattling in the tin cup, Swing Away Golf is a foley lover's treat. Additionally, the game also features a good hour or two of digitized speech, mainly from a play-by-play commentator and the various opponents you'll encounter. Indeed, few moments go by when you're not either being complimented or razzed by someone."", ""All totaled, Swing Away Golf is a game whose features and execution could barely be explained by a book, let alone by a review. T&amp;E Soft has delivered a winner of a game for both golf fanatics and casual gamers alike. Though it couldn't hurt, becoming a pro isn't required in Swing Away Golf, and, as such, access to the game's quirky cast and various play modes is available to most audiences. For many, golf is boring and lacking in entertainment value.

Kiss Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"['<i>Kiss Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child</i> is an intense first-person shooter based on the rich world created by Todd McFarlane in his bestselling <i>Kiss Psycho Circus</i> comic books. The world of the Psycho Circus comes alive with vivid, combat-heavy environments, a wall of audio, and more eye candy than a Kiss concert.', 'The game plunges you into a demonic world of mystery and horror, where you must battle the hideous freaks of nature spawned by the dreams of The Nightmare Child. Players begin as a mere mortal and progressively acquire the powers of The Elder, the supernatural alter egos of Kiss. The Elder, embodied through Demon, Starbearer, Beast King, and Celestial, must prevent the unraveling of the cosmos.', 'The nightmare minions are largely split into three groups: horde creatures, circus mutants, and bosses. The hordes have their strength in numbers and come at you by the truckload; the circus thugs are stronger, smarter, and possess special abilities that vary depending on their profession. At the heart of each realm is a nightmarish boss, who puts your powers to the ultimate test.', 'When you see the word ""KISS"" in the title and four different retail box designs each spotlighting one of the members of KISS, you might reasonably expect that KISS: Psycho Circus - The Nightmare Child would feature wall-to-wall KISS - kind of like this sentence. But oddly enough, KISS: Psycho Circus contains very little of the legendary rockers - some coy song references, snippets from a few hits, and a portrait of Paul Stanley are about as KISS as it gets. As such, faithful members of the KISS Army hoping for the ultimate rock shooter will be particularly disappointed with Psycho Circus, the first game by Third Law Interactive, a development house founded by ex-Ion Storm employees. For everyone else, Third Law\'s attempt to re-create the frantic action of classic first-person shooters such as Doom is fairly good but ultimately too formulaic.  KISS: Psycho Circus is actually based on the Todd McFarlane comic book of the same name. Unlike the band, the game makes absolutely no attempt to rock - instead, it has a generic techno soundtrack. What\'s worse, it\'s a techno version of a KISS song! And if the story in the game is any indication of the quality of storytelling in the comic book, then Third Law might have been better off spending its Todd MacFarlane money on a tanker truck full of Blatz. Let\'s just say the plot involves a witch speaking - at great length - about some indecipherable mumbo jumbo.', ""You control the four members of a band that isn't KISS as each one battles through a multipart level picking up pieces of a KISS costume along the way. Once you've completed the four areas, a fifth and final level opens up."", 'The environments are each quite large and compose a sort of ""greatest hits"" package of shooter themes. The castles of Unreal, the modern offices of Half-Life, the freak show of Blood, the steel plant of Kingpin, and the hellish pits of Doom all return in spirit in KISS: Psycho Circus. Even the greenish canyons of Daikatana make an appearance. Psycho Circus does have a few original settings, such as a towering 50-story bookcase. The game uses a heavily modified version of the LithTech engine used in Shogo and Blood II, and generally speaking, it does an excellent job. Though often unoriginal, the levels look good.', ""Psycho Circus is a pure shooter. The challenge lies solely in combating endless waves of enemies as you move from the start to the end of every level. The game throws a lot of monsters at you, sometimes as many as 20 at a time. You haven't seen swarms of monsters this dense in a shooter since the heyday of Doom, and at first, it's exhilarating having so much to shoot. Setting off a jack-in-the-box grenade in the midst of ten creatures is undeniably satisfying. However, like most of the weapons in the game - especially what passes for the rocket launcher - the jack-in-the-box seems underpowered. And unfortunately, once you've played the first ten minutes of Psycho Circus, you might as well have played the first ten hours. Though there's an occasional exception, the same creatures appear throughout the entire game. Some of the enemies are totally forgettable, such as the spiderlike Headless, which appears in virtually every battle in the game. Other monsters in Psycho Circus are more interesting, such as a zombified fat lady who rips chunks of blubber out of her distended belly and tosses them at you. But because the fights aren't particularly tactical or tense, the experience becomes repetitive long before Psycho Circus is over."", ""There's yet to be a shooter since Quake III and Unreal Tournament that's earned as much praise for its multiplayer gameplay. Psycho Circus doesn't break this trend: it features nothing more than standard deathmatch and team deathmatch. There's also a mode called conquest, but it's just deathmatch with a scoring adjustment. Psycho Circus doesn't have a built-in game finder either, nor does it include Mplayer, Gamespy, or any other third-party matchup service. Worse yet, once you actually locate a server, you might encounter fairly regular crashes back to your desktop."", ""Aside from its drab multiplayer mode, KISS: Psycho Circus is fairly entertaining. Unfortunately, apart from the fact that the band itself makes too few appearances, the core gameplay is too shallow to sustain the entire game. The firefights are too similar to provide much excitement the tenth time through, much less the hundredth. Ultimately, Psycho Circus is one game you and the boys won't be playing all night.<i>--Erik Wolpaw</i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Evil Dead: Hail to the King - PC (Bundle),,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Ash, the square-jawed, insult-spewing, shotgun-toting, chainsaw-armed hero from the cult classic <i>Evil Dead</i> trilogy is back. Picking up eight years after the last installment of the <i>Evil Dead</i> films, Ash is drawn back to the infamous cabin in the woods only to again face evil forces that have crossed over to our world. Our hero finds himself slicing and dicing carnivorous Kandarian demons, vicious deadites, and other unspeakable atrocities spawned by the notorious Book of the Dead. And in true <i>Evil Dead</i> fashion, Ash must once again attempt to save the world from an appalling and horrific end.', '<i>Evil Dead: Hail to the King</i> takes the survival horror genre to new heights by combining the successful formula of suspense, action, and puzzle-solving with over-the-top bloodlust and signature Ash humor--all within the confines of the <i>Evil Dead</i> universe. There are over 20 original and familiar enemies and recognizable environments, in-game cutscenes and prerendered sequences that allow the story to unfold, and increased freedom of movement and attack ability.', 'The Evil Dead films might as well have been based on a videogame. The heroic Ash can attach a chainsaw to one arm, carry a shotgun in the other hand, and spout off more one-liners than a post-Commando Schwarzenegger. This is not the kind of thing Hollywood normally makes unless a hot license is already attached. The glib humor boiling just beneath the surface of the trilogy (Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, and Army of Darkness) has achieved a legendary status among cult classics. Now, courtesy of THQ and Heavy Iron Studios, Ash and the legions of the undead have been unleashed upon the game world.<P>The game begins eight years after Army of Darkness, when Ash returns to the scene of Evil Dead 2 -- the cabin in the woods. Plagued by nightmares he can\'t explain, he realizes that the Evil has once again infiltrated the world -- and only he can stop it. <P>""The game will include several of the cool elements seen in the films,"" says Producer Scott Krager, ""but will also add to its existing mythos by providing new environments, enemies, characters, and weapons as well as a storyline that continues the saga of Ash and the Necronomicon.""<P>While there is a significant story to follow in the game (it\'s nearly Evil Dead 4), make no mistake about it -- your primary mission is to kick some evil butt, discover how to shut it down for good (or at least until the next game), and, of course, get the girl. Never forget the mantra: <I>Good, bad, you\'re the guy with the gun.</I> <P>Great care has been taken to preserve the feel of writer/director Sam Raimi\'s films. Both Renaissance (Raimi\'s production company) and Bruce Campbell himself are involved in the project at some level to make sure that it stays true to the feel of the movies. <P> ""In fact,"" states Krager, ""it was the filmmakers [Raimi and Rob Tapert] who wanted to return to the roots of Evil Dead and include the cabin and woods as primary locations."" Even the opening movies have been rendered in a very Raimi-esque style and the pre-rendered camera shots used in the game will feature many of the views that the director has become famous for.<P>With loads of evil creatures and undead apparitions, it seems appropriate that <I>Evil Dead: Hail to the King</I> will offer similar stylings as horror-fests such as <I>Resident Evil</I> and <I>Alone in the Dark</I>, complete with pre-rendered backgrounds and realtime characters. Still, the comparison seems almost unfair, as the team at Heavy Iron has completely re-thought its way through every aspect of the design. Unlike the developers of the aforementioned series, those at Heavy Iron feel they need not take themselves too seriously when dealing with such campy horror fare. (To this day, we believe that Capcom wasn\'t trying to be funny with <I>Resident Evil</I> dialogue such as ""It might be handy if you, the master of unlocking, take it with you""). Add to each area loads of animations (fires flicker, fog drifts in and out) and 24-bit color (a rarity on PlayStation), and this is one of the best looking games of its type.<P>Aside from the jokes and some new effects, the combat is what\'s really going to separate this title from the established horror titles. <P>""The Evil Dead movies are full of stylized, fast-paced action punctuated with a great sense of humor,"" notes Krager. ""When evaluating the other survival horror games, we noticed a distinct lack of this style of gameplay.""<P> Because Ash can attach a chainsaw to his arm and swing it about as a weapon, the designers at Heavy Iron felt it would be necessary to give you control of the other arm, which means you can actually wield two weapons at once. You can imagine the grisly scene: Ash with his chainsaw hacking a path through a horde of deadites, shotgun simultaneously blasting. <P> ""When players enter a room and face a deadite, they won\'t be asking, \'Do I have enough ammo to kill this guy or should I just run?\'"" proclaims Krager. ""Instead they will be faced with the question, \'Should I take this guy down with my chainsaw, two blasts from my shotgun, or maybe a combo using both?\'""<P> Accentuating the action is a combo system that allows players to pull off more complicated maneuvers in the heat of battle. To reward players for better moves, Ash will utter better one-liners for more complicated kills. There\'s nothing cooler than immobilizing an enemy by shoving your chainsaw through him, shoving your shotgun in his mouth, pausing for a second for dramatic effect, and then uttering ""Groovy"" before blowing off his head. Make no mistake about it, this game is going to get the M rating. <P> Despite your awesome firepower, the enemies Ash encounters are often more than a match for him. Besides the fact that they can outnumber him on screen by as much as 4-to-1, they are all capable of multiple attacks. <P> ""The game won\'t be just a string of encounters with slow-moving zombies,"" says Krager. ""The enemies are more varied with respect to look, moves, and personality.""<P> In total, there are over 20 different types of monsters that Ash will need to deal with, including such classics as the deadites and skullbats. New additions include demonic rednecks and what looks like a troop of evil boy-scout creatures. Of course, you can also expect plenty of boss battles to punctuate certain chapters of the storyline.<P> There are still quite a few months to go before Evil Dead hits the shelves, yet already it\'s looking like Heavy Iron has a title that will not only satisfy fans of the movies, but create an entirely viable new series for gamers to look forward to. Come this fall, Evil better beware. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>']","by

Red Faction - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Helping minors win the ultor corporation by shooting down the blue guards that is led by ultor. Help hendrix and the rest of the ultor mining camp, this is the best game i played in the late 90's to the year 2000's!!!!"", 'As we made ourselves comfortable in the demo room for THQ\'s unveiling of <I>Red Faction</I>, I figured I\'d get the toughest question out of the way straight off. ""So, what is it about this game that\'s going to set it apart from everything else?"" Without hesitation, Rob Loftus, the Associate Producer, responded, ""Take a look at this!"" Half an hour later, I had come to the conclusion that the genre of first-person-shooters was about to get a much-needed kick in the pants. <P>What was it, you ask, that convinced me that <I>Red Faction</I> will make a very big splash when it hits store shelves next year? It\'s a new-fangled bit of code called Geo-Mod -- essentially the engine that will power <I>Red Faction</I>. What this brilliant new piece of programming brings to the table is the ability to perform real-time, arbitrary geometry modification. Don\'t worry -- when I first heard that phrase I had no idea what it meant either. Simply put, this engine is capable of simulating advanced physics effects on the environment - if you shoot something you put a hole in it relative to the size and trajectory of the projectile that hit it. <P>For instance, you can fire a rocket into the ground and it will leave a crater (to be used as a solitary fox hole). Fire off a few more rockets into the same hole and you\'ll have a nice little trench for yourself to hide in. In other words, the environments are completely blow-up-able (for lack of a better description). Of course, it goes much deeper than shooting holes in the ground. Is that sniper in the tower bugging you? No problem... blow up the tower\'s base and watch the little camper fall from his nest to a (well deserved) death. Stuck in a room and no keycard/key/lock combination? Blow a hole through the wall. Need to get inside a pipe? Blast it open. The possibilities are endless. As Alan Lawrence, Lead Designer for <I>Red Faction</I> puts it, ""We wanted to give the player the power to destroy whatever he wants, not just pre-determined objects."" To emphasize the level of Volition\'s achievement in getting this engine functional, Epic Game\'s tech guru, Tim Sweeney, had described deformable terrain as ""the holy grail of first-person gaming."" From this showing, Volition ""chose wisely"".<P><b>The Physics of Liquids and Gases</b><br>Structures aren\'t the only things that you can realistically interact with in <I>Red Faction</I>; liquids and gases also behave as they would in real life. If you see a stream of water, you can fire a rocket into the side of that stream and the water will flow into the new hole you just made. You can even completely redirect that stream of water and make it go anywhere you want. Smoke from pipes will travel in the direction that the wind is blowing and sparks from electricity will bounce off the floor. None of this is pre-scripted; it\'s all on the fly. Even your bullet casings will bounce off surfaces realistically. For every action, there\'s a perfect reaction delivered by this impressive engine. Blow the support columns of a bridge and it will collapse, crushing any and all enemies beneath it. Needless to say, the Geo-Mod engine is unlike anything we\'ve ever seen before.<P>However, as an old wise man once said (actually, it was just Rob Smith), ""What good is an engine without a killer game to go with it?"" Luckily, Volition has proven time and again that it is a very capable development house. After all, it did bring us the excellent <I>Freespace</I> games. With <I>Red Faction</I> the group plans on surpassing anything it\'s done in the past with the goal of dethroning the current king of first-person-shooters, <I>Half-Life</I>. To do this, a full-time writer is tasked with ensuring a deep and involving storyline. There will be in-game cut scenes, as well as in-game dialogue to keep the narrative going and draw you in. As Lawrence put it, ""We\'re focused on creating a realistic and consistent world for <I>Red Faction</I>, with the goal of creating the most immersive FPS to date.""<P>The story follows a man named Parker, a miner on Mars who works for a large conglomerate known as the Ultor Corporation. Apparently, a deadly disease known as The Plague [that pro writer is earning his corn! -Ed] is spreading through the miner population. Already stuck with inhumane living conditions, the miners decide that this is the final straw. A rebellion breaks out and Parker gets caught up in an epic struggle to bring down the Ultor Corporation and find a cure for the deadly plague. Of course, this won\'t be easy; Ultor is a very large company with great influence, power, and almost unlimited resources. And like any megalomaniacal conglomerate worth its salt, it reeks of pure evil. As should be expected, Ultor uses its influences to bring in a group of mercenaries to stamp out the rebellion.<P>So what\'s a poor miner to do when faced with overwhelming odds? Get guns, of course...lots of guns. While the list of available weapons is not finalized yet, it has been confirmed that there will be around 15 of them. Definitely making the line-up are a handgun, an assault rifle, a sniper rifle, and a rocket launcher, and the others will maintain similarities with real world weapons. Volition plans to ensure that all the weapons will have a satisfying and visceral impact - a direct result of the responses to Epic\'s <I>Unreal</I>. The assault rifle fires either in bursts or at full-auto, and has a very distinct chatter that will be instantly familiar to anyone who has been exposed to the real thing (and lived!). <P>The sniper rifle is fairly standard issue, but is sure to please. The true head-turner will be the rocket launcher. This compact tool of destruction comes complete with its own infrared scanner. A screen attached to the launcher displays a red glob whenever an object that gives off heat is in range. This allows you literally to see through walls. For example, you could be walking down a hallway watching the scanner and spot the bad guys, even if they\'re hiding behind something. You can then use the rocket launcher to blast through the wall and take that sorry sod out to pasture. Of course, the infrared scanner will have a limited range. Volition is still hard at work on the rest of the arsenal, but you can be assured that the final lineup will be more than adequate for your fragging needs.<P>Finally, there are the vehicles: submarines, APCs, and various flying vehicles round out the selection. You can use the APC to ram through walls, and it also has a mortar mounted on it to get rid of other pesky barriers. One of the most impressive parts of the demo was the underwater sequence where piloting submarines serves up some deep-sea action. The effects are incredible and will remind many gamers of <I>The Abyss</I> (but not that crappy ending). Enemy subs actually implode when destroyed and the light sources are incredible. There\'s even plankton in the water to help give you a sense of motion.<P>With a promising storyline and the Geo-Mod engine in its corner, this could be one of the biggest hits of 2001. The engine should open up previously unexplored areas in the genre and add some much-needed innovation. If the rest of the development schedule is as productive as what\'s already been accomplished, we\'ll have to dust off some of the superlatives reserved for the likes of <I>Half-Life</I>. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>']","by

Summoner,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['From the creators of the award-winning Descent and FreeSpace series comes <i>Summoner</i>, an original, graphically brilliant role-playing game. <i>Summoner</i> crafts a unique look and complex story in an intriguing fantasy setting. Summoners have toppled empires and challenged gods. They are venerated as saviors and feared as destroyers. With rings crafted by the ancient Khosani, the gifted can call forth demons, dragons, and elementals, but only the strongest can hope to control the forces they unleash.', ""The player takes the role of Joseph, who has yet to embrace or control his power as one of the last remaining Summoners. To save his kingdom from annihilation, Joseph and his reluctant companions must journey to the lost empire of Ikaemos, the island monastery of Iona, and the forest labyrinth of Liangshan. Their quest for the Summoner's rings is the only hope for salvation."", ""Summoning is an ability unique to Joseph. As you progress through the game, Joseph will find ancient rings that can harness his summoning ability. Each of these rings has a specific property (darkness, flame, light, etc.). When used by themselves, or in combinations, they have the power of summoning a creature to Joseph's side. In multiplayer mode, <i>Summoner</i> is a party-based hack-and-slash type of game. The players can travel from level to level, killing monsters and collecting items and experience. Along their journey, players will also complete short quests."", 'After they finished up <I>Descent: FreeSpace</I>, the game designers at Volition had one desire: to make an incredible roleplaying game. Well, <I>FreeSpace 2</I> was too tempting, and half of the team went off to work on the incredible space combat simulation, while the other half started working on some RPG ideas. Now, under the publishing banner of THQ, Volition has started to show early builds of the upcoming <I>Summoner</I>, and we have to say it elicits bucketfuls of drool.<P>The story centers on Joseph, a young man who had an unfortunate accident -- he wiped out his entire village. Granted, it wasn\'t really his fault -- the village was under attack, and he used some unique fledgling powers to summon a demon to combat the invading force. It worked, too -- except for the fact that after dispatching the last of the invaders, the demon turned and started bashing up the village and killing people left and right. Ostracized and haunted by his deed, Joseph heads out into a world filled with fun and adventure. <P>The engine looks fabulous. While many aspects of how it\'ll work are still up in the air, what we saw showed a 3rd person view of four-character party. The camera is movable, although Volition is still debating whether or not to keep the camera fixed at a high or low angle, or let it be free-form. The angle of the camera will affect how the artists create the artwork, however, so it\'ll likely be fixed, and more than likely that it\'ll be fixed at a isometric view very similar to <I>Baldur\'s Gate</I>.<P>The similarity to <I>Baldur\'s Gate</I> is an apt one, as the team has taken several ideas from the hit RPG of last year. One such quality is the instant-pause mode -- hitting the spacebar freezes the game and lets players input commands to their party. Hitting the spacebar again executes the given commands. It\'s a system that works well, and should be used in more games, as far as we\'re concerned.<P>Each of the characters is rendered in loving detail, and even light maps on different items and weapons look impressive. Capes flow and move when a character runs, including tassels and ponytails. Volition used the hardware available to them extensively, and might even add more cool effects as new hardware accelerators are released onto the market. The unoptimized engine ran smooth as silk as Joseph and company ran through the countryside and through cities.<P>The game will contain most of the usual roleplaying conventions, although characters and places have a decidedly feudal Japanese influence, as well as the typical fantasy-esque Middle Ages European feel. While Joseph, since he\'s the main character, can be just about any profession from sorcerer to fighter, other characters to join your party will have pre-determined professions. The game will have hand-to-hand fighting, magic spells, and bountiful mini-quests and sub-plots to pursue.<P>However, it\'s good to know that some of the normal conventions are modified and updated. For example, while hand-to-hand combat will work just like most games (pick a target, choose ""Attack,"" and watch the action), the modeling of the characters is so accurate that the designers can create choreographed battles, with thrusts, parries, and dodges for each character. As a test, they even examined the <I>Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace</I> trailer and re-created the fight scene between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon using the game\'s engine! They project that as characters grow more experienced in fighting, the moves will become more diverse, so players won\'t watch the same combat animations again and again. Plus, should the party encounter a low-level character, you\'ll actually be able to see a fighter decapitate the creature with a swing, while parries and thrusts will be traded between more equal opponents.<P>The spell system will follow suit with some amazing spell effects that make full use of the 3D environment. Currently, the team has about 40 spells planned, and their goal is to make sure that each one is actually useful. Rather than use the typical cop-out of creating several different versions of the same spell, they want to make sure that each one makes sense, and grows in power as the character raise their levels higher. <P>The real unique aspect of the game is Joseph, however. Because he is the Summoner, he can do just what his title implies -- Summon creatures. He\'ll be able to bring forth elementals, demons, and a variety of other entities. While they\'re not sure how many different creatures he can summon, Volition will make sure that it\'s plenty to keep players busy. The trick is that the summoned creature only sticks around for a certain period of time. Furthermore, Joseph can only control the creature for so long. If he\'s too weak to control a nasty demon, the rest of the party could fall to the same fate as his hometown. <P>With their incredible 3D engine and some marvelous innovations in how RPGs look and feel, Volition has a hit on their hands. We can\'t wait to see more of this game come Fall 2000, and we\'ll certainly keep you updated on any progress the game makes. Until then, however, we\'ll just have to keep drooling in anticipation. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>']","by

Granted, there is something to be said for a good story and well-thought-out characters, but when the genre is examined from a technical standpoint, only a few innovations have surfaced that have gained much in the way of mainstream acceptance.', ""Enter Orphen: Scion of Sorcery, a game with an altogether different game system. In many respects, the game plays much like a platform adventure, though there is a definite sense of character development, however streamlined its processes. The game puts you in the role of Orphen, a young ne'er-do-well of sorts who wields formidable magical powers. Along with two apprentices and the odd companion or two, you explore a detailed 3D world, complete with all manner of hazards. Platform-game elements are prevalent, as is a light load of exploration, which is facilitated by a set of real-time maps."", 'The game\'s most endearing aspect is its battle system. Drawing obvious inspiration from Panzer Dragoon Saga, among other games, Orphen\'s combat is a sort of hybrid real-time/turn-based system that most jaded console RPG gamers should find most refreshing. The usual trappings of RPG combat - magic points that regulate the use of spells and such - are shed in favor of a more dynamic, liberating system. For use in combat, any spell in your arsenal can be mapped to one of three face buttons on the controller, with the fourth button reserved for a standard ""shield"" spell. All the spells have differing effects. Some are geared toward melee combat, while others are straight-up projectile attacks. And you can ""charge up"" most of them by holding down their respective button to maximize their effect. A melee spell that mimics a sword, for instance, will cause the blade it summons to grow longer when charged, while one of the game\'s projectile spells will shoot forth a greater number of bolts, depending on how long you charge it. There are quite a number of spells available, and their effects are varied, making the assembly of your arsenal a pleasurable undertaking.', ""The enemies you encounter move in a sort of rhythm on the battlefield, which makes targeting an exercise in memory and coordination. True, most area-effect spells can effectively blanket the battlefield in destruction, but it's seldom that simple. The act of targeting is interestingly handled: Each battlefield will have its own preset target spots, onto which your enemies will often move. The key to victory is figuring out when your enemies will land where and deciding what spell would most effectively take advantage of the situation. Oftentimes other targets are more attractive than the enemy itself - such as swinging censers or flaming braziers, which damage your foes indirectly and often more effectively. In short, the beauty of Orphen's combat system is the way that it least resembles what has become console-RPG tradition; that is, it's active and engrossing."", 'In terms of the overall production, Orphen: Scion of Sorcery is a tad weak. The game looks decent graphically, and the fully rotatable camera present in most areas works like a charm. The graphics are clean, sharp, and cohesive. The quality in-game effects are wildly disparate - in some areas and encounters, the splashing of water looks laughable, while in others, subtle lens flares and motion blurs are used to an almost artistic effect. To say that Orphen has some of the most inventively rendered boss fights would be only a slight exaggeration - superbly scripted and immensely playable, the encounters keep you in control, and the action seldom relents.', ""Outside of combat, the game is often a series of disjoined plot sequences, which unfortunately highlight the game's poor translation. All too often the action breaks, and you'll be pulled into a cutscene - all of which feature spoken dialogue - that is likely replete with exaggerated voice work, hyperbolized gesturing, or an unpleasant mixture of both. These frequent intrusions into the heart of the game essentially hack at the seams of the overall experience and do much to undermine the game's effect as a whole. The inability to skip the cutscenes makes them even more annoying."", ""The disjointed nature of Orphen is unfortunate, because it's easy to envision great gameplay experiences being the product of its game system. Let's hope that Activision decides to make use of the Orphen's high points in future products, in spite of the game's relatively lukewarm reception. <br> <i>--Miguel Lopez</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc.

NBA Live 2000 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""One of the newest additions to EA's sports lineup, NBA 2000 features more action, more slamming, and more attitude. Broadcast-style camera technology brings you to the heart of the action. Next-generation facial animation with added speech links gives the players more personality and attitude. You can go five-on-five or one-on-one on the street court, with the greatest names in the NBA, past and present, as NBA Live exclusively brings you retired names in the NBA, including the greatest all-time player, Michael Jordan. Play with one of five All-Star teams from the past decade or create your own classic matchups."", ""Using EA's Get in the Game technology, you can put yourself and your friends in the game or go head-to-head against NBA stars and play against your favorite teams. EA even provides a forum for NBA Live 2000 fans to chat and share inside tips on its Web site."", ""EA Sports' NBA Live series is like the Chicago Bulls of basketball games. The Bulls were the dominant NBA team of the '90s and arguably the best basketball team ever. No other team even came close, and any time a contender like the Jazz reared its pretentious head to challenge them, the Bulls slapped them down in the championship when it counted. Similarly, EA Sports' NBA Live was the dominant basketball game of the '90s. A few companies like Microsoft and Fox have tried to compete, but NBA Live remains the premier basketball game on the PC. However, just as the Bulls recently split apart and turned into the biggest turkey in the NBA, so too has NBA Live lost much of its luster. Fortunately, NBA Live 2000 hasn't taken as big a fall as the Bulls; it's only lost a step compared with the new games in town."", ""NBA Live 2000 is basically the same game as Live 99, with the addition of Michael Jordan and a cast of all-stars from the '50s to '90s. It has the same types of gameplay as before: arcade mode, simulation mode, exhibition games, single-season games, and multiple-season games in franchise mode. The NBA Live series' dizzying array of options also remains intact. You can tweak graphics detail, adjust quarter length, toggle virtually every official NBA rule, or throw everything out and just play wild arcade basketball."", 'Like 99, Live 2000 lets you manage your team through multiple seasons and try to create a consistently winning franchise. However, whereas Live 99 only let you play ten seasons, Live 2000 requires you to play 25. It would have been nice to have an option to play for five, ten, 15, or 20 years, rather than forcing you to stick it out for 25. The new one-on-one mode is also a fun addition to the game, because it lets you play as or challenge the greatest basketball players in history. You can match Iverson up against Jordan or relive the classic Russel-Chamberlain battles of yesteryear.', ""Single games are still fun whether you play them in exhibition or season mode. The emphasis is on action, and as always, it's better to play offense than try to win on defense. However, it seems that every year, NBA Live gets better in terms of letting you play defensively if you so choose. I didn't steal too often, but I sure blocked a lot of shots."", ""NBA Live 2000 adds a direct shoot and direct pass option, so you can force shots, dunks, and layups. But in reality, direct shooting does not mean you will automatically get your dunk or layup. You'll occasionally be frustrated when you think you're in position for a dunk and end up seeing your player try a jumper from under the basket.

Sure, I love a good deathmatch as much as the next guy, but when September rolls around, the one game I want to play more than any other is hockey. I've been devoted to EA Sports' NHL Hockey series since I played the original on my old Sega Genesis. Of course, as a hard-core hockey fan I'm also one of the series' harshest critics, eternally hoping that EA will make the game more realistic and challenging. Thankfully, this year EA Sports came closer than ever to achieving the perfect balance between realistic gameplay and graphic appeal. Sure, NHL 2000 has its flaws, but most of these are overshadowed by the game's many strengths. Simply put, NHL 2000 is virtual hockey at its finest."", ""At first glance, NHL 2000 looks like the same game EA shipped last year, with a handful of visual enhancements. Rest assured that this is not the case: Among the many under-the-hood changes, EA Sports finally changed the way the game clock works. Now, instead of offering 5-, 10-, or 20-minute periods, the game always simulates a 20-minute period with an acceleration modifier that lets it last anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes of real time. This has two significant results: First, the game now computes goalies' statistics correctly. Second, the computer-simulated league games now generate realistic scores and statistics, instead of the low-scoring tallies of previous versions. This means that your league leader boards will now include player stats from computer-controlled teams, instead of just those from your own high-scoring team."", 'More obvious changes to NHL 2000 include even more lifelike computer-controlled players and strategies, which are built upon NHL 99\'s marked AI improvements. While it may not be as true to life as Radical\'s PowerPlay series, the gameplay in NHL 2000 is by far the most realistic of any game in the series. This time, AI players forecheck more aggressively and get back into a good defensive position after a turnover. Additionally, players will get caught out of position when they go for an ill-timed body check or steal, opening up more breakaway and odd-man rush opportunities. The game also offers more coaching strategies, including a ""crash the net"" option.', ""Speaking of one-timers, they actually work in NHL 2000. Nothing was more frustrating in NHL 99 than setting up a perfect two-on-one play, dishing the puck to a wide-open winger, and seeing him smash a one-time slap shot into the goalie's chest. This year, if your guy really is in a good position and shoots the puck cleanly, you will score. You'll find that penalty shots (which are a little less common this year) and breakaways are easier to score with as well. You may even tally a goal or two on plain old shots from the point."", 'The computer opponents in NHL 2000 are craftier, quicker, and more skilled than in previous versions. While NHL 99 and its predecessors use a basic ""body check/get the puck/shoot"" algorithm for AI-controlled teams, NHL 2000 uses more of a ""shoot/shoot/shoot"" method of challenging you. And though I occasionally got outshot by the computer in NHL 99, I found that I was almost always being outshot and out-checked by the AI in NHL 2000 - usually at a two-to-one ratio in both cases. This is the one area where NHL 2000 remains unrealistic. Shot totals are still ridiculously high, but at least now a more realistic number of those shots will actually go in the net. In fact, the computer scores a lot of goals now - occasionally in a frustrating ""that damn AI is cheating"" manner.', ""As a result, the game is more difficult than NHL 99 but less frustrating at the same time. True hard-core players will begin to wallop the computer with regularity after 20 to 30 games, even on the hardest difficulty setting, but very few sports games have ever been able to prevent this type of mastery. Also, if you choose to play the game with a bad team (my beloved Islanders, for example), you'll find yourself sorely ill-equipped against AI-controlled powerhouses like Colorado, Dallas, and Detroit."", ""Of course, you can ditch the real teams altogether and use the game's new (and long overdue) fantasy draft feature. This lets you build a custom team from scratch by drafting against the computer. The draft is flawed - Adam Deadmarsh and Bryan Berard are almost always drafted before Jaromir Jagr, Paul Kariya, and Teemu Selanne - but it does let you customize the gameplay. Similarly, the career mode has been enhanced in NHL 2000 so that you can now draft rookies before each season, while aging players will retire and move on via free agency."", ""Another significant new feature is the Internet multiplayer support, complete with an EA-maintained lobby system. It's not the slickest online gaming system, but it is convenient for finding opponents. The gameplay can be choppy, but it does work, and the game host can choose client-server or peer-to-peer connections."", 'But no matter how you play it, NHL 2000 is simply beautiful. New animations for shots, checks, and goalie saves are augmented by the new face-mapping technique that makes every NHL player look exactly like his real-life counterpart. Better yet, you can even import a picture of yourself and have it mapped onto a custom player of your own creation.', ""The audio effects in NHL 2000 are as good as ever, with excellent lifelike sounds for every body check, shot, and arena noise imaginable. The game even includes a library of prerecorded names so that your custom players can finally get their due during play-by-play and PA announcements. And even though the play-by-play still suffers from the same out-of-sync problems of previous versions, it is considerably more accurate than it was in NHL 99. Also, EA finally brought in decent color commentary talent in the form of ESPN's Bill Clement."", 'If NHL 2000 deserves to be criticized for anything, it would have to be for the unusually high number of injuries that now take place during an average game. In a single period of my first season game, I lost four players for two to three weeks each, while two guys from the computer team went down. You can turn the injury feature off, but it would be better to use a slider bar for injury frequency, like the penalty and fighting frequency options already in place. The only good thing about the injuries is that they force you to manage your roster, by trading for new talent and juggling lines to bolster an injury-riddled squad.', ""Also, the game's computer-arbitrated trading system has a flaw that lets you upgrade your team while seriously deteriorating the talent of other squads. Basically, you can trade any player for any other player whose overall skill value is one to three points higher. Using this loophole, I was able to turn the Islanders' Eric Cairns (rated a 56) into Jaromir Jagr (rated a 100) using a sequence of 15 trades. I even spent an hour doing this for the entire Atlanta Thrasher team and created a squad where no player was rated at less than 80. Fortunately, only complete hockey dorks would waste so much time exploiting this problem."", ""Overall, NHL 2000 is the best hockey game EA Sports has ever produced. Despite the inflated shot totals and the not-quite-perfect draft, career, and trading features, this is as good as it gets in PC hockey games. It's definitely worth the upgrade for NHL 98 and NHL 99 users, and those new to the series will surely find it worth the investment. <i>--Michael E. Ryan</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Dark Side of the Moon:  A Sci-Fi Adventure - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['When SouthPeak Interactive released its first adventure game, Temujin, back in 1997, it achieved only a few of the lofty goals it had set for the project. Utilizing a proprietary game engine called Video Reality, Temujin was designed to combine the high level of interaction of traditional graphic adventures with the realistic look of digitized video sequences. <P> But instead of giving gamers the best of both worlds, Temujin wound up giving them very little of either: Movement and character interaction were limited, the digitized backgrounds blurry and hazy. And while the story was undeniably a gripping affair, the puzzles were of the boilerplate variety - the kind designers tend to ladle on top of a product when the lion\'s share of the budget has gone toward film shoots and developing new technologies (can you say The 7th Guest?). <P> Now, after a year of tweaking, the Video Reality engine is back in Dark Side of the Moon - a game that proves not only that phrases in the public domain can\'t be copyrighted no matter how popular a rock album is, but also that SouthPeak learned some valuable lessons from Temujin. Unfortunately, SouthPeak will also learn a lesson from this game: The Video Reality engine, at least as it stands now, is woefully inadequate in handling exploration and movement, two of the most critical components in an adventure game. <P> Part sci-fi thriller and part murder mystery, Dark Side of the Moon casts you as Jake Wright, a young man whose uncle supposedly committed suicide on a moon called Luna Crysta in the Cepheus-6 star system. A megacompany called Brave Hope Corporation has set up shop on Luna Crysta to reap the bounty of minerals and ores residing in the multitude of underground caves; besides company employees, the moon\'s also home to a collection of fortune hunters looking to strike it rich. And then there are the Cepheids, the natives that Brave Hope hires because of their tireless work ethic and knowledge of the moon. <P> Your uncle\'s left you his mining claim on Luna Crysta, but even before you arrive on the moon to settle the inheritance, you receive a scathing vidmail from your sister wherein she says the claim should have passed to her. And things only get more suspicious when you disembark the space shuttle: The president of Brave Hope wants to buy your claim, and a PI hired by your sister finally admits he\'s there to make an offer on her behalf as well. Hmm... that\'s a lot of interest in a claim that, to the best of your knowledge, never brought your uncle anything but long hours and hard work. Eventually, you\'ll meet up with that PI to talk things over - and when you do, the plot begins to take some wicked twists that I can\'t reveal here. <P> Like Temujin, the acting in Dark Side of the Moon is generally good, and the video clips used during conversations are crisp and clear; unlike Temujin, nearly all Dark Side of the Moon\'s puzzles are integrated solidly into the plot and gameplay. Many involve finding ways to surreptitiously enter offices, where you can locate clues about your uncle, the Brave Hope Corporation, and the Cepheids working in the mines. But there are also lots of object-based puzzles in which you have to figure out creative combinations of inventory objects - and while the clues are definitely there, keeping track of everything can be daunting. Nearly everything you see, hear, or read contains at least a kernel of useful information - especially when it comes to the item descriptions at the General Outfitters, the only place you can acquire a couple of very necessary pieces of equipment. And because there\'s no type of description displayed when you access inventory items, you\'ll need to keep notes of what each device is and what it can do. <P> But there are a few instances where Dark Side of the Moon doesn\'t exactly play fair and square. When you pass your cursor over an object in the environment that you can manipulate - a door, for instance - it usually turns green to let you know you can interact with it. But for some reason this doesn\'t happen in a couple of very sticky spots; instead, you have to have an inventory object selected and then pass the cursor over the thing in the environment you want to act upon. The net effect? When you get stuck, you wind up looking around and wondering if you\'ve exhausted all the options at a locale, or if instead you need to start dragging out inventory items to see what might work in conjunction with something you\'re trying to use. Believe me, this game would still be plenty tough even if it gave adventurers a little nudge in the right direction. <P> Still, it\'s probably better to make the puzzles more rather than less difficult, especially given the easy availability of hints and tips on the Net to get you through rough spots. And the plot has enough surprising developments to make you want to keep playing to find out the whole story. But Dark Side of the Moon falls short of being great for one simple reason: The Video Reality engine isn\'t up to the task of handling a gameworld as large as this one, particularly when success often depends on walking around until you find the right object or clue needed to keep advancing. <P> Digitized video takes up a lot of space, so it\'s no surprise that the game comes on six CDs. But what is surprising is how much disc swapping is required just to move around Luna Crysta. As you get deeper in the game and discover a warren of secret passages that give you access to every location, you\'ll be amazed at how frequently you\'ve got to switch discs to traverse the facility. Near the end of the game, you\'ll have to move from a secret underground area to the shuttle terminal and back again - and that means swapping discs around ten times! Because the game is to a large degree nonlinear, I\'m not sure how this problem can be addressed. But considering just how much exploration you\'ve got to do to acquire objects and the impact the constant disc swapping has on the game\'s pacing, it\'s definitely a major problem. <P> Actual character movement is a lot faster than in Temujin, but it still takes painfully long just to turn around and survey your environment, and your ability to look up and down is still confined to only places where key objects or new directional paths are located. Background scenery is little improved over the blurry and hazy images of Temujin, making it difficult to pinpoint landmarks and spot important objects. And should you encounter the technical anomalies I ran into on my rather standard system - digitized speech crackling and dropping in and out, video speeding up and slowing down - you might have real trouble gathering important information. <P> Dark Side of the Moon\'s interface has a few other glitches - lots of scrolling to find inventory objects, awkward methods of reading scanned documents in your digital assistant, disc swapping when viewing stored video clips (also in the digital assistant), and a paltry number of characters for a ""boomtown"" like Luna Crysta - but these are minor blemishes compared with the problems of navigation and exploration. If SouthPeak corrects those for its next game - or creates a new engine more along the lines of the ones used in Black Dahlia or Atlantis: The Lost Tales - it could easily move into the elite class of adventure-game developers.<i>--Stephen Poole</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Play the Classic Game under the familiar rules, trading cards for armies and rolling the dice to outdo your opponent. Play the Simultaneous-Turn option for a whole new <I>Risk</I> experience that includes I-COM communication and negotiation features, territory-depth enhancements, and territory bidding. <I>Risk 2</I> is the ultimate form of this world-domination game that people of all ages have enjoyed for 40 years."", 'When it comes to computer versions of board games, you\'ll almost always get a compromise. Either the computerized version no longer plays anything like the original board game, or there\'s not enough difference to even warrant a computerized release. Fortunately, the sequel to the strategist\'s strategy game is something of an exception to the rule, as it not only stays faithful to the original gameplay, but it also presents some pleasant new spins on the classic Risk formula. <P> Risk II now comes in three different variations of Parker Brother\'s classic board game. There\'s the classic mode, which you play using the rulebook of the board game; the same-time mode, which eliminates individual player turns and instead determines the results of all players\' attacks simultaneously; and a tournament mode, which is a series of both classic and same-time games that awards points for completing certain objectives. <P> The same-time mode is essentially a brand-new game. While the mode uses only a slightly different map and set of rules, its differences and subtle nuances are enough to throw off even the most brilliant of Risk strategists. Instead of having individual player turns, same-time Risk is now split into phases. Each phase lets you set up your armies and attacks, then the conflict begins once everyone has submitted their battle orders. During this period of time, armies on the offensive that have yet to attack are considered en route to the country they will be invading and cannot defend their home country. Thus, attacking armies have to be considered carefully, as sending your whole army on an attack leaves your country vulnerable to an attack from a neighbor. In addition, multiple neighbors can now attack one country, giving an advantage to the player who owns the most of any country. <P> Same-time Risk doesn\'t use the classic six-sided dice; instead, it uses a completely new die rule - the attacker and defender each gets one 12-sided die that has a certain amount of number values on it, depending on the size of the army. There are five ranks of the 12-sided dice, called ""battle dice"", from white to black. The white die rolls an average of 2.6, while the black die rolls an average of 4.5, making it easier for larger armies to destroy smaller ones. Not only does the color of the battle dice determine how strong your roll will probably be, but it also determines how many armies you\'ll lose upon the outcome of the roll. While this new system is certainly interesting, it\'s somewhat one-sided, and it completely eliminates the infamous ""Rambo"" scenario in which your single defending army successfully repels an attack, even though it\'s hopelessly outnumbered. The advantage is now definitely with the attacker, as the defender no longer wins a tie in same-time Risk. To make up for this, same-time Risk sports a rule that limits exactly how many armies you can use to fortify certain territories. Unfortunately, this rule is frustrating, as you\'ll often find yourself with more reinforcements than you can spend on your border territories, making you waste those armies on a country that\'s not at immediate risk. With all these variables, same-time Risk is a quicker, more ruthless game than the classic version, and it couldn\'t possibly exist without the assistance of a computer to keep track of all the details. <BR>--<I>Ben Stahl</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc.

Beach Head 2000  - Mac,,[],"['Video Games', 'Mac', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""If you've seen <I>Saving Private Ryan</I>, you might agree that the first scene in the World War II film stands out from the rest. The scene lasts around 25 minutes, and it's an incredibly visceral, visually graphic re-creation of the D-day invasion of Normandy. The action takes place from the perspective of the American troops who storm Omaha Beach in armored landing crafts only to meet with a deadly barrage of mines and enemy fire. WizardWorks, the same publisher that brought you <I>Deer Hunter</I>, tries to capture the intensity of a WWII beach attack in <I>Beach Head 2000</I>, a loose remake of an old Commodore 64 shooter. For a short time, it may prove to be a fairly entertaining diversion. However, <I>Beach Head 2000</I>'s limited gameplay won't hold your attention for long."", ""In <I>Beach Head 2000</I>, you're a lone turret gunner defending a stretch of beach that's under siege. You view the beach from a first-person perspective and aim using the mouse. Your turret is equipped with a machine gun, a howitzer cannon, and guided surface-to-air missiles. You also have a handgun to use as a last-ditch defense. At the beginning of each level, you're given a limited amount of ammo for each gun. Much of the game strategy comes from deciding when and where to employ this precious supply of ammo. Fortunately, supply aircraft make frequent parachuted ammo and health drops. But to obtain these, you've got to shoot the drop package itself. Attempting to nail these drop-offs with anything but a machine gun poses a considerable--and at times frustrating--challenge. Even if you get the extra ammo, you may still come up a few missiles or rounds short, which can make completing the level nearly impossible."", ""<I>Beach Head 2000</I>'s graphics are OK sometimes, but pretty rough in certain respects. The enemy choppers, armored personnel carriers, landing craft, tanks, and bombers are rendered in 3-D with real-time lighting effects--and they actually look decent. The problem is that many of the units pop up out of nowhere, almost as if the game were rendering them late. The infantry troops don't look nearly as good: the foot soldiers are acceptable, but only from far away as they file out of the armored landing crafts. As they draw closer, their choppy animation and 2-D photo-scanned faces look silly."", ""<I>Beach Head 2000</I>'s gameplay is fast paced and straightforward. It plays similarly to old arcade shooters such as <I>Operation Wolf</I> and <I>Terminator 2</I>, only the screen doesn't ever scroll in any direction. The levels steadily increase in difficulty until it seems as if they won't get any harder. After that, you just continue on and rack up as many points as you can by gunning down the enemy. You can't actually win. The game grows old quickly, as taking out the stream of enemies in each level becomes repetitive. Even the enemy units themselves soon become predictable, as the ground and air units seem to repeat the same maneuvers over and over again. Also, although your inability to move makes sense in the context of the game, it makes the game much less engaging."", ""<I>Beach Head 2000</I> isn't horrible, though it's not ambitious at all. It has moments that can be satisfying, and the gameplay is quick and easy to learn. If you're a casual game player looking to let off a little steam in a WWII environment, you might enjoy <I>Beach Head 2000</I> for a little while. But the game isn't suitable for anyone else. <I>--Copyright (c) 2000 GameSpot, Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the team soon discovers that these crisis situations are actually related to the nefarious plots of not one, but two antagonists: the Russian Mafia and a Middle Eastern terrorist organization--groups who have, until now, been able to escape the jaws of international justice.

Following Mr. Clark's detailed mission briefings and background information, you will lead your team against these sinister powers and help make the world a better place. <P> The most obvious improvement in Rogue Spear is the graphics engine, which has been heavily modified to allow greater levels of detail, larger mission environments, and better character animations. Most of the scenarios are simply gorgeous and are amazingly detailed. Buildings are richly decorated, while outdoor areas are more lifelike than before. In most indoor areas, even the most out-of-the-way rooms are highly detailed, complete with random civilians wandering around in some areas, like a fat guy in a towel heading to the sauna. Rogue Spear also includes weather effects, such as snow and rain, which can hamper your ability to see and hear terrorists. <P> One graphic enhancement you definitely won't miss is the vastly improved character animation. Not only do the 3D models in Rogue Spear look more realistic, they also move in a more lifelike fashion. A slew of new motion-captured animations have terrorists bolting out of rooms when you hurl a flashbang, rushing to investigate strange noises, and dying in a seemingly endless array of dramatic Hollywood-quality deaths. Your own team members will also maneuver in a variety of new ways, including moving in a crouched position and limping severely when they've been wounded. The game still suffers from polygonal clipping problems, but overall it looks a lot better than Rainbow Six. <P> Rogue Spear is at heart the same game as Rainbow Six, only with a number of new features that enhance the overall experience. For starters, you can now crouch and peek around corners. These are perhaps the most useful new features in the game, since they let you remain stealthy and peek into rooms before entering them. Also, you can now bring along dedicated snipers, who set up shop and pick off tangos with deadly accuracy when you give the word. Though there are only a handful of missions where snipers are genuinely useful, it still is nice to have them as an option. <P> Rogue Spear has several new weapons, including three different sniper rifles and several new assault rifles. However, this is a mixed blessing since 90 percent of the missions require the utmost stealth and secrecy. Most mission briefings warn you that the terrorists will flee or kill hostages (thereby ruining your operation) if they catch the slightest hint of your approach, and for this reason, you almost always want to carry a suppressed weapon to keep things on the sly. <P> The watch mode introduced in the Eagle Watch mission pack is still available in Rogue Spear. This lets you plan a mission and then have your operatives carry it out while you look on in safety. You can also jump in and assume control at any time. <P> The game introduces several new operatives, including a number of characters from the Rainbow Six novel and a few additional leader-types (so you don't have to worry quite so much about losing Chavez any more). Rogue Spear also offers 18 missions, two more than Rainbow Six. Once you complete a mission, you have the option of trying it again in two great new game modes: Lone Wolf, which challenges you to traverse the map alone, with randomly placed tangos on the alert, and Terrorist Hunt, which lets you wander the map in an effort to liquidate each and every bad guy. In both modes, all additional elements are thrown out, including hostages and bombs, so it's just you against the bad guys. Also, Rogue Spear retains the practice mission and branch campaign options from the original game. <P> Unfortunately, in addition to all the new features, Rogue Spear also includes some significant gameplay imbalances. On the one hand, Red Storm has significantly fine-tuned the enemy AI. Terrorists now react much more realistically to everything that happens around them. Not only that, but they react very quickly and shoot very straight, and they rarely, if ever, miss their targets. By itself, this would not be a problem, but because the friendly team AI is so flaky, the game can be overwhelmingly difficult for all the wrong reasons. <P> In several areas, particularly on the Kosovo and hijacked airliner missions, the terrorists always react faster than your men - always. In fact, your computer-controlled team members tend to move and react much less effectively than they did in Rainbow Six. True, they don't get hung up in doorways quite as often as they used to, but they don't survive missions as often either. Worse yet, your guys still get stuck on ladders on occasion and even fall off elevated walkways, sometimes fatally. <P> Part of the problem here lies in the mission-planning phase of each operation. For the most part, this mode is exactly as it was in the original Rainbow Six. The major differences include support for the new action orders (cover, defend, snipe) and an improved 3D view of each mission area. However, even with the 3D view enabled, you seldom get a good feel for the operation area until you actually enter the mission. This causes countless problems while planning missions, because you often can't tell what sort of area you're asking your troops to pass through. <P> Also, because of its larger and more intricate mission areas, Rogue Spear could have seriously benefited from a much smoother, more intuitive, and less cluttered planning interface. In Rainbow Six, mission planning was one of the highlights of the game. In Rogue Spear, it feels more like a chore. Planning the stealth-only missions in this game, in fact, is almost absurdly difficult given the size of the mission map and the numerous guards scattered around it. <P> On a more positive note, Rogue Spear's multiplayer options are phenomenal. The game offers several adversarial modes, including assassination, in which you attempt to defend an NPC general, and stronghold, in which one team must defend its base from the other team's attack. The game is playable on both Mplayer and MSN Gaming Zone, though your mileage will most certainly vary on both services. Yet while the game's multiplayer options are impressive, the performance seems to be all over the place. Many users have complained loudly about sudden network drops and crash bugs, while others rave about the game's stability. Passing final judgement on Rogue Spear is difficult. While it has numerous noticeable problems, it retains the original game's charm and unique style. The new features are good, particularly the addition of snipers and crouched movement. Multiplayer support is also excellent, though it does still need tuning. Overall, the game succeeds almost in spite of itself, because Rogue Spear is damn good at its core and more of a good thing for fans of the original Rainbow Six.<i>--Michael E.

Labeled outcasts from society by this mysterious twist of fate, the two live in shame and fear. As the legend goes, all who lay eyes on the Crest will suffer great misfortune. While on separate revenge quests, the two are mysteriously transported to another world: the desolate Rieubane Empire. Here the two heroes discover the true destiny of the Crest-born as they are pursued by the forces of evil, and they fight to save this cursed land.', 'While Evergrace\'s story is relatively original, its gameplay isn\'t - despite a few interesting nuances. As you explore the ruins of the Rieubane Empire from a third-person perspective, you\'ll search for keys, hit switches, and perform many other perfunctory RPG duties in order to advance. Unfortunately, explore is a term used loosely - Yuterald and Shalami are confined by gravity and the terrain types, making for a stiff, by-the-book tour of Rieubane. As you wander around, enemies randomly appear in your path to provide the necessary combat element. Unfortunately, the combat is a strategy-free, slow-paced affair, made so by pea-brained AI and a limited number of combat options. Most battles require you to simply shuffle around toward an enemy\'s backside, strike, and repeat until the foe is dead. As in the Secret of Mana games, your character has a power meter that is depleted by each strike - attack with 75 percent power and you\'ll inflict 75 percent of your normal damage rate. This wouldn\'t be a problem if running didn\'t drain your power - exploring the world or even dodging generally leaves you unprepared to fight, requiring you to ""walk it off"" before engaging in combat. Yuterald and Shalami both maneuver with taxing stiffness in some of the game\'s tighter areas, which is a nuisance and usually results in numerous unavoidable hits.', 'While you choose either Yuterald or Shalami at the beginning of the game, you can actually switch between the two characters\' paths at your leisure by using save crystals. While the two tracks and stories are completely independent, each of the characters will make appearances in the other\'s quest. In From Software fashion, Evergrace features a high level of customization options for the avid RPG player. In a nod to Final Fantasy VII\'s Materia system, ""palmira"" gems can be mixed and matched on weapons and armor to create your own unique arsenal. For example, placing a flame palmira on a sword will result in a flame sword of some sort. Palmira have limited uses, however, so you will have to use these magical resources sparingly. Armor, unlike in most games, is accurately represented on the character models.  Taking advantage of this, you can custom-color your outfits to tailor your character\'s appearance however you choose. Gifted with an eye for fashion, the shopkeeper may give you a discount if you assemble a pleasing and color-coordinated ensemble. Levels aren\'t handled in the typical fashion, either - every once in a while an enemy will drop a ""Biriyana"" seed. Consuming these magical seeds lets you increment your characters\' stats however you please. While these are all interesting features, they don\'t hide the fact that Evergrace\'s core gameplay is awkward and uninteresting.', ""Originally developed for the PlayStation, Evergrace was retrofitted for the PlayStation 2 to fill the system's RPG void.  Unfortunately, this shows - Evergrace isn't as graphically pleasing as a PlayStation 2 RPG probably should be. While Yuterald and Shalami have relatively high polygon counts and interchangeable armor, the enemies and environment are a different story. Sure, clumps of grass have been added and the monsters' textures are fairly high resolution, but Evergrace still manages to look like a high-resolution PlayStation game. Even with these less-than-cutting-edge visuals, Evergrace's battles are somehow subject to slowdown when more than two enemies appear on the screen. Fortunately, Evergrace's sound represents a stronger effort. Soothing fantasy-themed music wafts through the environments and digitized dialog moves the story along."", ""All in all, Evergrace is just shy of average - there's nothing particularly bad here, but what little good it has is purely incidental and generally ignorable. Scheduled to ship alongside the PlayStation 2 this October, Evergrace is sure to face stiff competition from Sony's deeper Dark Cloud and the number of high-profile Dreamcast RPGs coming out around the same time.  In light of this, Evergrace is probably a game you can do without.<i>--Peter Bartholow</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001 Championship Edition - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""As another baseball season approaches, another impressive-but-flawed version of 3DO's High Heat Baseball is upon us. Now sporting a big-time celebrity endorsement, Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001 is a very solid effort that improves upon last year's version with a series of subtle enhancements. Though the latest version of High Heat suffers from a number of minor flaws once again, it's still the early favorite to capture best-of-breed honors in PC baseball sims this year. The game's basic design hasn't changed very much. You can still play exhibition games, full seasons of varying length, play-off tournaments, and a home-run derby. A new batting practice mode lets you step into the box for practice swings against a fully adjustable computer pitcher. For example, if you're having trouble hitting a curve ball, you can set the pitcher to fire nothing but curves while you try to make contact. Additional multiplayer options now let you tackle season and play-off games against fellow High Heat fans, whereas last year's version only supported exhibition games in multiplayer mode."", ""The graphics engine has been tweaked, but only slightly. The most notable improvement is in the additional variety of player models. Now, big guys like Glenallen Hill and Frank Thomas actually look much larger in the game than smaller players like Craig Biggio and Pokey Reese. Yet though the visual variety is a welcome change, the overall quality of the player models is still less than stunning. The players in High Heat 2001 don't look nearly as good as those in previous baseball games like Triple Play 2000 and Microsoft Baseball 2000. Some players in High Heat 2001 have their real faces mapped to their player models, but most of them still have that one same face, and the same enormous eyebrows, from the original High Heat. At least High Heat 2001 now supports night games as well as day games."", 'Fortunately, the game now offers a wealth of new player animations that help liven up the on-field action. Players take extra steps as they make running catches, which introduces the concept of momentum to the game. This can actually affect gameplay, as it now takes longer to throw the ball after making a running catch, and players will even occasionally run into the outfield walls and drop the ball as a result. Other new animations include players pumping their arms after roping a double or triple, umpires who punch out strikeout victims in varied and elaborate fashion, and diving fielders who hold up their gloves to show that they made the catch.', ""Of course, any true High Heat fan knows that graphical quality is a secondary concern. The thing that's always set High Heat apart from its competitors is the realism of the on-field action, and in this important regard, High Heat 2001 maintains the series' sterling reputation. Each individual game played in High Heat 2001 unfolds realistically, as dramatic pitcher-batter confrontations and crafty computer moves will leave you scrambling to find the right pinch hitter and bullpen ace. Just when you think you've figured out the computer's style, it stumps you with a surprise move. Getting caught flat-footed when Mark McGwire bunts for a suicide squeeze in the bottom of the 11th inning should be enough to teach any player how sneaky the High Heat computer opponent can be."", 'But the realism in High Heat 2001 goes beyond good artificial intelligence. For the most part, players in the game perform as they would in real life, as they hit for power when appropriate and even register accurate win-loss records on the mound. Better still, the realism generally carries over to season statistics, where 50-homerun hitters and 20-game winners are as rare as they should be. The game does seem to have a few glitches in the statistics engine, such as during a time when Sammy Sosa himself played in 159 games despite a midseason injury that sidelined him for 34 contests, but the errors seem few and far between.Other bugs and flaws in the game aren\'t quite as inconsequential. For one thing, High Heat suffers from a serious bull-pen bug once again this year. The game has problems when you try to perform a double switch; it sends your pitcher back to the bull pen, and it also drops his ""warmed up"" rating to zero and leaves a hole in your lineup. Any attempt to put the pitcher back in his rightful spot results in a crash. The bug doesn\'t crop up every time you attempt a double switch, but it occurs more often than not.', ""In addition, the pitching interface seems downright unfair at times. While the computer pitchers seem to be able to hit their corners regularly, it's almost ludicrously difficult for human players to do so, even when controlling a pitcher with a control rating of 85 or higher. As a result, you often throw a lot of balls when you try to throw strikes. In real life that may not be too unrealistic, but the situation doesn't improve on the game's two easiest difficulty settings, and that's a problem. Also, your pitchers have a nasty habit of throwing fat, juicy home-run balls right down the middle of the plate when you attempt to throw garbage pitches outside or down. Many of these problems seem to stem from the game's erratic or at least imprecise controls. Not only can the pitching be frustrating, but often when fielding you'll find the ball winging its way to third when you thought you threw it to second. This control problem cropped up with more than one player using several different game controllers on multiple systems."", 'Furthermore, the sound in High Heat 2001 really needs an overhaul. The play-by-play vocal tracks seem virtually unchanged since last year\'s version - and for that matter, since the first version of High Heat. The commentary is lifeless, repetitive, and in desperate need of improvement. Still, it sounds brilliant next to High Heat 2001\'s horrendous ""ambience"" clips. For some reason, the developers saw fit to include a bunch of celebration/taunt sound bytes that erupt in a variety of game situations. For example, after a strikeout a voice might chime in with a regretful ""Aw, man!"" while a pop-up might elicit an unseen heckler to yell, ""Your shoe\'s untied!"" at the last minute. All of these clips are poorly recorded and sound like the work of programmers who had too little sleep and too much access to sound equipment. Worst of all, each of these clips plays at a much higher volume than the rest of the game\'s sound effects, which makes them even more jarring and annoying. The celebrations and taunts aren\'t necessarily a bad idea, but they should be much more refined for future versions of High Heat.', 'Aside from its occasional flaws, High Heat 2001 is essentially an improved version of High Heat 2000. The latest version offers just enough new features and graphical enhancements to entice fans of the series to upgrade. High Heat 2001 is at least as good as it was last year, and it will certainly contend for the PC baseball crown once again this season.<i>--Michael E. Ryan</i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc.

"Army Men World War: Land, Sea, and Air",,['1 or 2 Players'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""3DO's Army Men franchise is a successful one, with more than 20 games, related books, and numerous merchandising tie-ins. However, despite this success, the games themselves are never any good. The visuals are usually poor, the gameplay is contrived, and the fun factor tends to peak upon your tearing open the wrapper. Bearing this in mind, 3DO is back with the latest in its Army Men franchise, Army Men World War: Land, Sea, Air for the PlayStation. It's been barely seven months since the last Army Men game, but more surprising than its timeliness, Army Men World War: Land, Sea, Air is actually a good game. You read correctly: 3DO has created an Army Men game that's fun to play.  Army Men World War: Land, Sea, Air begins its assault rather plainly: The Tan army is up to no good and it's up to you to stop it. To achieve this goal, the game offers three modes: single-player, boot camp, and two-player capture the flag. Using a variety of targets and weapon choices, the boot camp mode acclimates you to the game's controls, which haven't changed since the last Army Men game. The two-player mode lets you and a friend go at it on a few of the game's maps, stealing one another's flags while dodging CPU-controlled bots. While the boot camp and two-player modes are nice, they're throwaways compared to the game's single-player experience. Eschewing the usual run-and-shoot tactics of previous Army Men games, Army Men World War: Land, Sea, Air combines third-person fighting, first-person sniping, Metal Gear Solid-style sneaking, and vehicular combat into a vicarious wartime romp."", ""At it's core, nothing is different about Army Men World War: Land, Sea, Air's gameplay. You still need to run around killing Tan soldiers while adhering to mission objectives. The game's stock weapons, the M16 machine gun, binoculars, and bayonet remain unchanged as well. Though the bug that got your soldier stuck between rocks has been fixed, the game's controls once again emphasize weapon choice and shooting while limiting your movement in a number of bizarre ways. An onscreen cursor lets you toss a grenade anywhere you can see, but you can't strafe or run backward, and turning around takes forever. Admittedly, while the interface could be better, the game still gives you a decent amount of freedom, allowing you to crawl, crouch, and tiptoe your way through enemy lines. You're going to need this freedom too, as whoever designed the levels for Land, Sea, Air knew what he was doing. Some missions call for quick precision attacks on enemy installations, while others require a modicum of stealth. Unlike prior Army Men games, there are times in Land, Sea, Air when calm use of your bayonet will get the job done quicker and more efficiently than any amount of firepower. Enemy AI has also improved, and while you're not exactly fighting Einstein out there, the Tan soldiers will circle behind your location or feign death to draw you closer."", ""Topping things off in the gameplay department, Army Men World War: Land, Sea, Air mixes its ground combat offerings with six vehicular and special-weapons levels. Although vehicle control remains on rails throughout, you'll get to partake in a number of activities, ranging from gunner on a bomber plane and handler of an antiaircraft battery to machine gunner on an Apache helicopter and rifleman on a raft. It's disappointing that you don't have more control over driving these actual vehicles, but their presence nevertheless provides a fun diversion. In fact, thanks to the mixture of assault, stealth, and vehicle missions, this is the first Army Men game that actually feels like a real war as opposed to a series of boring skirmishes."", ""Although it is nice to be able to speak highly of Army Men World War: Land, Sea, Air's gameplay, similar kudos cannot be given to its visuals. While 3DO has fixed the darkness problems from the previous Army Men, copious amounts of graininess, texture warping, polygon dropout, and draw-in plague the game at every turn. On a positive note, the majority of Land, Sea, Air's backgrounds are neither tan nor gray, eliminating another of the previous game's major graphical flaws, that of enemy invisibility. Because the game features mostly jungle and beach motifs, the evil Tan Army can't hide in plain sight anymore. Unfortunately, while Army Men World War: Land, Sea, Air boasts a solid frame rate and plenty of amusing character animations, it's still blockier and grainier than most early PlayStation games. Hands down, Army Men World War: Land, Sea, Air's greatest trait is its sound quality. Gunshots and explosions are loud and alarming, tearing through plastic soldiers with authority. The utterances the enemy soldiers make when walking, grunting, and leaping are also a delight to the ears. Furthermore, the game's background music is overwhelmingly varied and somehow even more majestic and awe-inspiring than the last Army Men game."", ""There you have it, a situation so surprising it almost hurts: 3DO's first decent Army Men game. Whether you're toting around explosive grenades, pinpoint mortars, or the dangerous bazooka, Army Men World War: Land, Sea, Air is a well-rounded game that's not just for kids anymore. The inclusion of vehicular combat, increased CPU intelligence, and clever level design makes Army Men World War: Land, Sea, Air a game that can satisfy adult gamers as well. It's just too bad the game's abhorrent visuals, combined with a few lingering gameplay quirks, relegate it to the unenviable position of being the best of 1996.

Offering players 21 different maps to choose from and 15 specifically created for the PS2 version, Unreal Tournament also boasts four-person simultaneous play via the iLink or a solo machine. An all-new control scheme joins a fresh skeletal animation system and the same thumping music from the PC edition, while a console-friendly interface and five different game modes round out the bottom line. Developer Digital Extremes has even enhanced the AI to be more in tune with the console market's tastes!"", ""When PC first-person shooters move over to console systems, most die-hard fans of the genre turn up their noses in disgust. Why? Because until lately, console systems really haven't done justice to their PC counterparts in the FPS department. As console hardware becomes more and more powerful, the graphics in these games get pretty close to those in the PC originals, but the control still sticks out like a sore thumb. A console's gamepad simply isn't an acceptable substitute for the first-person shooting controllers of choice, the mouse and keyboard. Unreal Tournament for the PlayStation 2 is one of the first console FPS games on the market to offer the gameplay and control options of the original. While it's really quite an amazing game, the still slightly flawed control and the lack of online play waters down what has been one of the greatest shooters to date on the PC."", ""Rather than spend development time working on a cohesive single-player scenario that most players will only play through once or twice, Epic Games used that same time to refine the multiplayer game. Consequently, the only single-player mode available serves as training for multiplayer matches by pitting you against computer-controlled bots. On the lowest of the four settings, anyone should be able to defeat the bots with little or no hassle, but once you bump up the difficulty, you'll have an actual challenge on your hands."", 'The single-player mode will also teach you the basics about each different type of game contained in Unreal Tournament. Of course, deathmatch is the old standard free-for-all battle. Capture the flag, the quintessential FPS team game, is also included. Domination is a different type of team game. Each domination level has three control points, and when you touch a control point, you claim it for your team. The longer you hold a control point, the more points your team scores. So you duke it out to see who can hold the control points the longest. Assault is yet another new team game in which one team plays offense and the other defends a base. Each map has a different set of offensive objectives (push the button at the front of the train, destroy four computers, and so forth). If the offensive team completes its mission, the two teams switch sides, and the new offensive team must complete the same objectives in the same amount of time it took the first team to succeed. You can configure any of these modes with ""mutators,"" which slightly tweak the gameplay. You can disable certain power-ups, play a one-hit kill mode, lower gravity, play at 130 percent of normal game speed, and more.', ""The selection of weapons in Unreal Tournament is mostly taken from the original Unreal, but the weapons have all been redesigned to look and sound much better. The new weapons include the impact hammer, which is more or less a portable pneumatic piston that you can use as a last resort when the rest of your weapons are empty. The pulse gun fires small energy shots in its primary mode, but the secondary mode spits out a rail of energy that you can sweep around, like Quake's lightning gun. The redeemer is essentially a portable nuclear missile - the primary fire mode shoots it in a straight line, but the secondary mode switches to a really great looking guided-missile view that lets you target foes from across the level. The nice thing about the game's weapons is that they seem really well balanced. There isn't a single weapon that causes you to run away in fear when you see it in your opponent's hands. The weapons may seem a little alien to players used to other first-person shooters, but once you get a feel for how each weapon operates, using them becomes second nature."", ""While the PC version is heavily centered on online play, Unreal Tournament for the PlayStation 2 offers multiple multiplayer options. Aside from the standard four-player split-screen, you can also use an i.Link cable to connect two PlayStation 2s together for two-player action. When using the Dual Shock 2 controller, the game controls roughly like other console first-person shooters, with one stick used to move and one to aim. When you let off the aim stick in this version, though, your view quickly snaps back into position - it would have been nice if this were a configurable option. Also, some players might not find a suitable control scheme, as the game only lets you choose from a few preset configurations rather than allowing you to configure the controller to your liking. Also, when playing with the controller, you're given the gift of auto-aim. Pushing in your aim joystick causes you to center on the nearest onscreen foe. Beyond that, the game even takes aim for you, allowing you to hit enemies who aren't even close to your targeting reticle. Upping the difficulty setting seems to lessen the effect, but there is no way to disable auto-aim short of using a mouse."", ""Unreal Tournament is the first US PlayStation 2 game to take advantage of the hardware's USB ports. You can jack in a keyboard and mouse and play the game just like you'd play the PC version. While the keyboard can be configured in several different ways, the mouse support only lets you use two buttons and the mouse wheel, and the only alteration to the mouse's configuration you can make beyond adjusting the sensitivity is setting which button is fire and which is alternate fire."", ""Unreal Tournament has consistently ambitious level design throughout, even in the PS2-exclusive maps, and the entire game benefits from it. The levels feel less like simple first-person shooter maps and more like actual locations, such as starships, old mining facilities, and temples. The game's music lends some atmosphere to the proceedings, but it occasionally overshadows the crucial sound effects you'll need to hear to keep tabs on what items your opponents are picking up, so it's best when it's turned down quite a bit from its default setting. Graphically, the game has a lot going for it. The textures are nice and sharp, and the models are well animated. There are lots of great weapon effects, such as the burst from the shock rifle or the smoke trail left by a wide spread of rockets, and the frame rate remains pretty solid throughout, even during split-screen games."", ""Of all the PC first-person shooters on the market today, Unreal Tournament stands out as the most robust. With all its modes and options, it delivers an out of the box experience like no other. This makes the translation to the PlayStation 2 a little easier to deal with. Sure, you won't be able to download Rocket Arena or any of the other amazing mods available for the PC version, but even on its own, UT is one of the most complete packages available. <br /> <i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc.

Devil Inside - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Developed by Cryo Interactive, a company best known for making point-and-click adventure games reminiscent of Myst, The Devil Inside is actually a fully 3D horror-themed action game with a few adventure elements thrown in. It's similar to the classic early '90s action-adventure, Alone in the Dark, and in fact the designer of that game worked on The Devil Inside. During the game, you play as the star of a bizarre TV show that tracks you, much to the delight of an international audience, as you fight your way through continuous encounters with supernatural villains. It's like Cops, but with zombies and graphic violence. The game's premise is interesting - especially since the main character, Dave, has the unusual ability to morph into the leather-clad succubus, Deva. However, The Devil Inside is marred by problems with its camera perspective and its play mechanics, as well as by the occasionally frustrating design of its various scenes."", ""You play The Devil Inside from a third-person camera angle that usually floats a few feet behind the main character. In fact, the camera view floats quite literally. In some of the game's cutscenes, which break from the standard third-person view, you can actually spot a small, propeller-powered hovering camera situated behind your character. You can even see it in the mirrors in the haunted mansion you explore, and during the course of the game, your entire view will sometimes get distorted with static when the camera gets jolted. It's an interesting and effective technique that helps justify the particular way you see the game. There's also a cameraman who follows your character most of the time, filming the action. He's supposed to be unobtrusive, but he does absolutely nothing to avoid danger, which, depending on the situation, is either funny or irritating. In any event, the cameraman seems like a missed opportunity. He'll hardly flinch if you happen to shoot him (by accident or not), and sometimes he'll even get in the way of the main view."", ""It's this third-person view that's the real problem. The camera in The Devil Inside can hardly handle a lot of the narrower settings in the game. As you travel through hallways and corridors, you'll find that the camera often has a very hard time keeping track of your movement. This is bound to frustrate you as you play, since you'd expect the game's camera view to do a better job of portraying the action. This is especially true because a game that puts so much emphasis on cameras in the first place ought to have done a better job with getting the view to look right at all times. The Devil Inside has a few clever options that let you view the action from different angles - for instance, you can watch the game from the cameraman's perspective, or set up spy cameras that let you view remote areas in a picture-in-picture display. Occasionally, the game will even pause to give an instant replay of a dramatic deathblow. But these gimmicky features don't change the fact that the game is difficult to control as a result of the default viewpoint."", ""The controls themselves exacerbate the camera problems. You move your character forward and back and side to side with the keyboard, but you really have to rely on the mouse to aim and turn. When you're playing as Dave, it's vital that you use the mouse to target your enemies' most vulnerable regions. You could pump more than a half dozen rounds of ammo into a zombie's midsection, but just one clean shot to its cranium will put it out of its misery just the same. Targeting with the mouse works just fine - but using the mouse to turn and the keyboard to move forward and backward is difficult. Your character takes big steps while running but moves too slowly while walking. He can't manipulate objects with a weapon drawn; you need to holster your gun to open a door, search a scene, throw a switch, and more. But equipping and unequipping your weapons just seems too slow, and you even need to come to a full stop to do it. All in all, the control in The Devil Inside just seems too awkward and inconsistent, because while at times it'll reward your pinpoint accuracy, at other times it'll seem very sluggish."", ""In addition, the game's adventure elements are underdeveloped. As you explore the haunted mansion, you'll occasionally come across particular obstacles that require certain items in order for you to pass them. Most often, the obstacles are doors, and the corresponding items are keys. Sometimes the door/key puzzles take a different form - but it'll still be the same concept. You just need to find a matching item to proceed. Needless to say, the action sequences in The Devil Inside tend to be a lot more satisfying than the puzzle-solving."", ""The action can get pretty intense sometimes. The game features a fairly extensive arsenal of weapons, and your enemies will react in different ways depending on wherever you happened to hit them. For instance, you can shoot the legs or even an arm off a zombie gunner, who'll still keep struggling to shoot at you with his remaining appendages. Furthermore, you'll often have to contend with rather large groups of enemies in close quarters. Some of the battles are scripted very well - you will become surrounded and have just barely enough time to fend off your relentless foes. But other times, the combat is poor. When the camera view gets obstructed, or when your enemies defy any sort of logic - they'll sometimes do nothing at all as you attack them. You'll wish that The Devil Inside were more polished."", ""Even so, you might still enjoy the game for its quirky premise, if not for its often-impressive graphics. Though the characters look somewhat plain, they look good enough. On the other hand, many of the environments in and around the haunted mansion are detailed, realistic looking, and very atmospheric. Unfortunately, the game doesn't sound nearly as good - many of the weapon effects, as well as the drab voice acting, are muffled. A game like this could have really benefited from better audio, since the TV-show concept lends itself to a lot more variety of sound effects than you'll actually hear in the game."", ""The Devil Inside isn't a very long game, yet the combat can be enjoyable enough to make it worth playing through more than once - but that's only if you can ever get used to the awkward shifts in the perspective, which can make the game very frustrating to play. Otherwise, the game's story and adventure elements aren't very interesting in themselves, and the novelty of the TV-show premise gets old soon enough. What's left are you, a lot of guns, and a lot of zombies - not to mention a fairly good-looking 3D graphics engine to show it all off. And for players who are looking for a horror-themed action-adventure game, this should prove sufficient.<i>--Greg Kasavin</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The Rally Fever table provides a more repetitive strategy where the duplication of certain ramp shots is the key to winning. <P>While it doesn't have the ultrarealism of a game such as Pro Pinball: Timeshock, Addiction Pinball offers more sensory gratification. The table design is really impressive. The tables look and feel like they were meant to be full-fledged arcade table designs. The ball physics, surface friction, and momentum forces respond realistically within the game, and pinball purists will be hard-pressed to find faults. And for those of you who even like the video modes of current stand-up machines, Addiction Pinball gives you some arcade action as well. <P>Addiction Pinball does contain a few irritating elements. The first is the Worms 2 table. If you find the voices of the worms from the original game annoying, you're going to be enraged by the time you finish one game on the Worms table. The Worms table provides too much flavor of the original game in the form of sounds and cutesy worm ambience. As for the Rally Fever table, such recycling of materials is justified and almost appreciated; in racing games, the squeal of the tires and the voice of the race announcer is an important factor. <P>In the end, Addiction Pinball is recommended if you're looking for a solid simulation. If you can handle Team17's style of self-promotion in the tables' theme design, you're going to enjoy the experience on the whole. <I>--Tahsin Shamma </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Unless you can find a new Weyrwoman to take up her mantle, your Weyr, and perhaps all of Pern, is doomed.', ""Based in the sci-fi/fantasy world of Pern, the setting of Anne McCaffrey's <I>The Dragonriders of Pern</I> novel, you take the role of D'kor, a novice dragonrider known as a Weyrling.

Stupid Invaders - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['With all the talk of adventure games being a dying genre, it\'s worth noting that several titles have been released recently, and more are in the works. While the titles aren\'t as prolific as in years past, gamers have still seen the release of such excellent works as <i>Escape From Monkey Island</i> and <i>The Longest Journey</i>. Unfortunately, Xilam and Ubi Soft have decided to add <i>Stupid Invaders</i> to the list of titles in the shrinking genre, so perhaps death isn\'t such a bad choice after all.Years ago, five aliens crash-landed on Earth. Etno, Candy, Bud, Stereo and Gorgious hid in a deserted house until the spacecraft was repaired, and finally that time has come. The player\'s job is to guide the five until they can return to their home planet while trying to evade the evil Dr. Sakarine and his hitman. <i>Stupid Invaders</i> is a traditional adventure game, with puzzles of the ""use X on Y"" variety that adventure gamers are familiar with, and the interface -- a hand that changes to show what is possible with an object -- is easy to understand. The bottom of the screen also explains what something is and whether the alien can interact with it, but is occasionally inconsistent, especially when indicating movement. Most of the time it would show ""Go here"" or ""This way"" or such when it was possible to change screens, but sometimes the words weren\'t there and other times clicking them did nothing. The only way to get the alien to go to that side of the screen was to walk it until it moved close enough to ""catch"" the words.', 'The graphics are absolutely stunning. Colorful and quirky, the game looks better than most Saturday morning cartoon series. The integrated cinematics alone are almost worth the price of the game, and each of the more than 500 game screens is perfect in style. To complement the graphics, the music and sound effects add ambience fitting to the area. In a laboratory, the music is reminiscent of a 1950s science fiction movie, while an elevator has, appropriately enough, elevator music. The voice acting is also top-notch, a difficult feat in gaming made more so by the dim-witted nature of the aliens and by dialog of such caliber as, ""Your butthole is going to take me back to my planet.""', 'The humor in the game is hit or miss, either laugh-out-loud funny or grimacingly bad. In fact, some of the jokes would probably make Beavis and Butthead cringe in disgust, and one, an implied rape, is disturbing. As a general rule of thumb, players who think the funniest thing Jim Carrey has ever done is his butt-talking routine will likely find <i>Stupid Invaders</i> right up their alley.', 'At the heart of any adventure title is its puzzles, and <i>Stupid Invaders</i> does the job sufficiently most of the time. Some of the puzzles are very easy to solve, especially for anyone even remotely familiar with the genre. Others require some thought, and those are the most enjoyable. Too bad so many of the puzzles require random guessing and pixel-hunting, taking the fun out of solving them. Even worse, and by far the most annoying aspect of the entire game, is that many actions will kill the alien and end the game. That\'s right, an adventure game that kills, although in quite amusing ways. Most of the time it\'s impossible to know that a particular action will end the game until it\'s too late, so excessive use of saving is actually necessary to keep from repeating sections. This fear of death definitely cuts down on the exploration and ""try anything"" approach to adventure gaming that most players are familiar with. It\'s almost as if the developers wanted to punish players for playing their game. This is the primary reason that <i>Stupid Invaders</i> gets a Miss instead of a Hit.', ""Some small problems contribute to this lackluster title. Reloading and saving are done with the F1 and F2 keys respectively. Players who jump right into the game without reading the manual may not learn this until it's too late. Towards the end, the game crashed to the desktop several times, but never in the same spot twice. Some of the characters the aliens can interact with have dialog options to choose from, but after going through all the options once, if players accidentally click on the character again, they have to go through every one of the options again. Finally, for a four-CD game, it's too short. It's possible to finish the game in fewer than 15 hours. Overall, <i>Stupid Invaders</i> is an adventure title that just isn't as much fun as it should be. But it's plenty stupid. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>""]","by

Stratego [Classic Value Series],,"['Annimated 3-D battles 1998 Hasbro Interactive, Inc.']","['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<I>Stratego,</I> the popular board game of battlefield strategy, comes to life on the computer. You have an army of men and weapons at your disposal. Your mission: capture your opponent's flag and protect your own. Your troops range in rank from scout to marshal--but your opponent doesn't know the ranks of your players. Each is disguised as an innocent drummer boy marching across the battlefield while cautiously sidestepping hidden bombs. When engaged in battle, characters morph into toy soldiers, and their ranks determine who emerges victorious. This is the game for developing your strategic skills."", 'There are three things that you can count on: death, taxes, and Hasbro developing another board game into a computer game. The good thing about this is that the overall computer skills of kids are bound to increase if parents purchase the computer game versions of the traditional board games. The hard part is making sure that the CD-ROM version of the game distinguishes itself enough from the original to make the computer game a valuable purchase. This is precisely the move made by Hasbro with the PC version of Stratego. <P> If you\'re unfamiliar with Stratego, it\'s a unique blend of simple strategy, memorization, and unit management. In the standard game, each side of the battlefield (composed of ten squares by ten squares) is populated by an army consisting of quasi-European military units circa 1820. The pieces on the battlefield give the impression of toy soldiers marching off to war. Before the game begins, each player secretly places his units so that when combat is initiated, the outcome becomes apparent only after the pieces in conflict are revealed. As for the details of combat, they have been vigorously toned down so that determining which units succeed in battle comes down to a simple comparison of their values (example: generals are worth 9 and defeat any unit worth less than 9). Likewise, movement is simplified to a ""one unit, one space per turn"" limit. This may all seem outrageously simple, and just goes to show why Stratego has largely remained a game interesting only to preteens. <P> To its credit, Hasbro has mixed up the gameplay significantly by providing four new modifications to game setup and play. The new game styles are ultimate campaign, alliance campaign, ultimate lightning, and alliance lightning. The ""ultimate"" styles of gameplay emphasize the standard one-on-one setup of the classic game, while the ""alliance"" modes offer options for four players. The ""lightning"" and ""campaign"" nomenclature refers to the style of gameplay within each setup. Lightning games play faster, while campaign games offer a bit more in the way of in-depth strategy. <P> As much as these new modes provide some very refreshing twists on gameplay, you\'ll still find that in essence, the game itself doesn\'t deviate much from its simple origins. The overall design is such that it should appeal mostly to younger kids learning the basics of strategy, problem solving, and decision making. Unit animations are cute and friendly, while the interface is simple and minimal. Part of the lure of more mature strategy games like Axis & Allies and Risk is that the re-creation of grand-scale classic warfare is not lost on a realistic map with real-life territories. The banal layout and gameplay of Stratego isn\'t enough to raise it beyond an ""advanced checkers"" feeling. And although the game provided is well executed and smartly presented, older gamers will find there\'s more nostalgic ardor for this title than captivating game design. <P> To its credit, Stratego does occupy a gray area that\'s more flavorful than backgammon and checkers, but it doesn\'t have the lasting appeal of those games in terms of simplistic game design that overlays a deeper level of strategy. It\'s a delightful game to teach kids the basics of combat tactics, but you\'ll quickly find little to keep you engaged for more than a couple of games. <I>--Tahsin Shamma</I> <BR> <i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

In it, you cruise along the Tokyo freeway looking for cars to compete with. Once you spot a possible contender, you flash your lights to issue a challenge, and the race is on. And that's the point where Tokyo Xtreme Racer diverges from most other racing games out there.  Instead of driving on a number of courses against a volley of different cars at the same time, you compete in a series of short one-on-one races on two different stretches of the same turnpike. Your goal is to keep ahead of your rival on a stretch of road for longer than he leads you. Each driver has a meter that counts down whenever he's in second place; if it runs out, he loses. The farther one car is ahead of the other, the faster the trailing vehicle's meter counts down. Beyond that, TXR is similar to other racing games where you earn money by beating your opponents, which you then spend to beef up your ride or buy new cars, or in this case, so you can compete against faster and tougher members of the city's racing gangs."", ""Tokyo Xtreme Racer's break from the norm could be compelling, perhaps, if you were driving through the city streets instead of the highway, or if the game took a break from reality to invent additional and more interesting courses. As it stands, the game has only two monotonous loops to race on, and driving on them gets quite dull, even in two-player mode."", ""The graphics are the best thing about TXR, and even those are a bit of a mixed bag. The frame rate is fast, there's virtually no pop-up to speak of, and the trailer effect caused by the cars' taillights is nice, but the car models leave something to be desired, and the two courses are plain, have repeating features, and don't even offer up the mirrored, backward, or different weather variations that we've come to expect from driving games of all styles. The soundtrack is only average; it doesn't detract from the experience of playing, but it doesn't add to it either."", ""TXR's physics are unrealistic even by arcade racing-game standards. If you hit a divider head-on at 90 miles an hour, you bounce back a few feet like a large unbreakable box that always lands right side up, and you start back up with no discernable damage to the car. Sliding up against a wall will cough your speed back a bit and knock you towards the center again, but more like a plastic toy car than a real vehicle. Besides its arcade-style features, TXR provides a racing-sim aspect by letting you fiddle with your car's stats to change its performance, but there's far too little there to appeal to simulation aficionados, causing the game to fail on both sides. Fans of arcade-style racing games are advised to hold off for Ubi Soft's Speed Devils and Sega's own Sega Rally 2. This is not a must-have Dreamcast launch game.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Majesty  - Mac,,[],"['Video Games', 'Mac', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<i>Majesty</i> is a unique sim, putting you in the crushed velvet hot seat of your own kingdom. With an epic quest before you, you make the decisions of where to build your settlement's guilds and temples. From these decisions, you recruit a varied cast of larger-than-life heroes. Each one has a mind of his own and must be enticed to meet your goals, via rewards you offer and spells you cast. Meanwhile, you must make sure that your treasury stays flush with cash to support these and other outlays necessary to maintain a thriving medieval town. The fact that you are being barraged by attacks from mythical beasts and fantastic creatures doesn't make your job any easier."", 'Poor choices will leave your kingdom in ruin, but a wise ruler will complete his quests, fill his coffers, and create a kingdom that will be remembered in song and story.', ""If Majesty helps set a trend, then 2000 might go down in history as the year in which gaming changed forever. First there was Maxis' successful suburban-life simulator The Sims, in which you set simulated people in motion and watched them live their lives under your influence. And now there's Majesty, which won't seem so revolutionary when you first look at it, but gets much more interesting as you start to play it. As in The Sims, the point in Majesty is influencing your subjects rather than directly commanding them, even though Majesty seems like a fairly traditional fantasy-themed real-time strategy game on the surface. <P> The big deal about both The Sims and Majesty is that they simulate autonomous behavior by recognizing that just because you want a person to do something, doesn't mean he'll actually do it. Although Majesty certainly doesn't simulate the full complexity of intelligent autonomous free will, it's still a great deal of fun and will likely help set a precedent for future games that take game characters' artificial intelligence even further. <P> Majesty is a real-time strategy game set in a medieval fantasy world. Your goal is to establish your kingdom and try to expand it. The problem is that there are lots of people and creatures out there who would rather not have you infringing on their rights, either as devoted citizens of other kingdoms or simply as individuals, and who defend against your advances or try to pummel your homeland. You have to build military defenses, cultural institutions, and everything else that will keep your people satisfied and prosperous, all while repairing what gets damaged and pumping tax dollars into an increasing number of things. At first, Majesty doesn't seem different from any other top-down real-time strategy games or empire-building games released in the past few years. <P> As the ruler of the land, you start each scenario with a palace. The palace gives you access to various actions such as constructing buildings, setting henchmen limits, and establishing rewards. All other aspects of the game revolve around balancing these various actions. You need buildings to protect the kingdom, produce materials, generate revenue, and act as home bases for your heroes. You use henchmen to perform the kingdom's necessary functions such as guarding, trading, and collecting taxes. But the core of the game, and its true innovation, lies with the heroes you'll have to recruit. <P> Recruiting heroes in Majesty is crucial. The henchmen that your palace and its guard towers automatically produce, which include city guards, palace guards, peasants, tax collectors, and caravans, perform the kingdom's day-to-day work. However, heroes let you expand your kingdom by exploring the territory surrounding your palace and by engaging in combat with monsters and other enemies throughout the land. To recruit heroes, you have to construct buildings in which they'll base themselves. Build a gnome hovel, and you can recruit gnomes, which are cheap but not very useful. Build a warrior's guild, and you can recruit warriors, who are more expensive but much more powerful - and later in the game you can recruit paladins, who are even stronger than the warriors. A dwarven settlement will yield engineerlike dwarves, while a ranger's guild will let you recruit your most capable explorers. Wizards can be recruited once you construct a wizard's guild, and they can cast powerful spells but are easily killed. You can also construct temples to various deities, and each will also let you recruit a specific kind of hero. One temple gives you healers, another provides priestesses, and still others offer monks, cultists, adepts, and fire-wielding women called solari. Each type of hero has its own capabilities, and each type costs a different amount of gold to recruit. You'll often find yourself unable to recruit the hero you need because your treasury is too low, and at these times you can miss several golden opportunities to expand. <BR>--<I>Neil Randall</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc.

Requiem: Avenging Angel (Jewel Case),,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The Breaking, an ancient war, once divided a great kingdom. Now the Chosen and the Fallen, two groups of angels, battle over the rule of Creation. It is your duty to defy the wrath of the Fallen and stop them from desecrating and overtaking Creation. Peppered with biblical references, <i>Requiem</i> is a 3-D action experience that centers on the holy battle between Heaven and Hell and takes it to new extremes.', ""Half-Life didn't usher in a new era so much as it showed us a glimpse of what the future holds for 3D shooters. While it would be unfair to ask that every game be as good as Valve's shooter, it wouldn't be unfair to expect all shooters hence to have better stories and better design. Cyclone Studios' Requiem: Avenging Angel isn't as compelling or universally appealing as Half-Life, but it is a pretty good shooter otherwise. Its pacing, level design, and graphics ensure that it's a typical 3D shooter, but the presence of some highly amusing angelic powers and the unique premise take it near the top of the current crop of action games. <P> In Requiem, you play Malachi, an angel sent by God to stop the machinations of the Fallen, angels who went against God's word and were cast out from Heaven eons ago. The evil outcast Lilith leads them and has decided to snuff out all human life. She has sent her agents to Earth, who are possessing Earth's leaders, rounding up the innocent, and using them to power a massive spaceship called Leviathan. The plot won't win a Pulitzer prize, but it does set up the action uniquely. All you have to know is that you are God's vengeance given form, and you must stop the Earthbound Fallen, while also occasionally doing battle with a few boss Fallen in the realm of Chaos, the limbo that exists between Heaven and Hell. <P> The game opens in Chaos, with you needing to find your way to the portal that leads to Earth. While Chaos is supposed to house the many lost souls, it is amazingly empty. This problem persists throughout the game. Certain levels are meant to be populated towns but are really just ghost towns with one or two NPCs. The pacing of this game is fairly slow in the beginning but does ramp up to some very intense action. Oftentimes, you'll find yourself getting ambushed from behind by half a dozen soldiers. These enemies tend to appear out of thin air, but at least they keep the action flowing. <P> In many ways, Requiem is your average shooter. Its level design is straightforward, with few surprises or branches. Some levels bog down due to an unintuitive puzzle or the need to fetch a key. If you failed to pass by the crucial clue or pick up the vital keycard, you could be wandering around in circles for a while. The plot, while unique in premise, doesn't really pick up until later in the game. It isn't compelling from the start; you meet one NPC who tells you to complete a task, and then you meet another who sets you up with a new mission. At this point, the gameplay is just wandering around killing things for the sake of it, rather than toward a greater goal. However, the story does become more prominent later and is helped along by an occasional cutscene. <P> What Requiem deserves praise for are Malachi's angelic powers. His normal weapons in the game are unoriginal - the obligatory shotgun, machine gun, rocket launcher, sniper rifle, etc. - but the angelic powers are something else entirely. The closest thing to them would be the Force powers in Jedi Knight, but the powers in Requiem are more interesting and better implemented. They are divided into different categories: offensive, defensive, maneuver, and interactive powers. Offensive and defensive powers are very straightforward, as are the maneuver powers, but the interactive powers include those that can be used to manipulate enemies in more exotic ways. You can possess an enemy and move through him with the possession power or compel an enemy to fight for you with insist. <P> The effects for most of these powers are quite spectacular. Enemies targeted by To Salt turn into solid white salt statues and stand frozen for a fraction of a second before disintegrating into fine white powder. Casting Time Warp conjures up images of the slow-motion action scenes in John Woo movies or The Matrix. Time Warp slows time down all around you. Enemies not only move and fire at half speed, but they also die in slow motion. In real time, a dead soldier would simply reel backward and fall spinning to the floor. But with Time Warp, you'll see frame-by-frame animation; he'll appear to float in the air, spinning around in slow motion, as the shells from your gun fall to the ground like feathers. <P> You gain angelic powers at different, preset points in the game, although the acquisition is pretty anticlimactic. You get a simple text message that says a new power is made available to you. Still, the powers themselves are impressive, with plenty of great eye candy to go along with their in-game effects. <P> The enemies and monsters consist of the typical human soldiers, a smattering of mechs, and a few Fallen beasts for variety. The first Chaos level introduces you to a few Fallen creatures, but then the next several areas are full of variously armored soldiers. They are well animated, especially when they die, although the boxes and goodies flying out of their heads upon death can only be described as silly. Even so, the enemies are among the better looking of the genre, being a step up from the more boxy and unimaginative enemies of games like Sin and Redline. <P> Although the special effects and death animations are pretty good, the look of the game is pretty bland. Even the otherworldly levels aren't too impressive. It's not so much that the Chaos levels look bad, but they could have looked much better. The other levels are straightforward in appearance and design. The levels that should be densely populated by neutral characters (like Chaos and the town hub level) are strikingly empty. There is also a lack of interactivity in the levels throughout the game, with hardly anything to blow up or manipulate. <P> The sound, unlike the graphics, has little to recommend itself. The voice acting for all the characters is incredibly poor, and aside from the tinkling of bullets bouncing off the armor of heavy soldiers, the rest of the audio is forgettable. <P> Overall, this game is a fine shooter. Its supposedly gripping plot is merely adequate. The game is pretty linear, but then most shooters are. The pacing and story aren't as good as Half-Life's, but the character interaction and angelic powers elevate the game beyond many other shooters. Then again, Requiem also could have benefited from an integrated search for open Internet multiplayer games in progress. It's a feature that shooters typically haven't had, but Half-Life, which raised the bar in so many ways, had it. Requiem isn't a game that will duplicate Half-Life's critical success and compel all forms of gamers to play it, but for shooter fans, Cyclone's game of fallen angels is fairly well-crafted, albeit typical. <i>--Elliott Chin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Disc(s) are professoinally cleaned. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', 'First there was the ultra-fun arcade game from Naomi. Then Capcom gave us the excellent <i>Rival Schools</i> on the PSOne. Finally the fun comes to the Dreamcast with <i>Project Justice</i>. This tag-team 3D fighter brings back 16 characters from the beloved <i>Rival Schools</i>, as well as six brand-new fighters: Class President, Ran, Zaki, Yurika, Momo and Nagare. Players pick three fighters to compete in these battles royale. The game does not allow players to switch back and forth between fighters in mid-battle like <i>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</i>; instead, players will switch fighters between rounds. But the extra warriors aren\'t just sitting on the sidelines picking their noses. <i>Project Justice</i> allows players to utilize their extra fighters in two ways: the first is a ""Party-up"" technique, in which the other two fighters will jump into the melee to perform a special move on the enemy. These special moves give <i>Project Justice</i> its originality and flair. The moves are utterly ridiculous and incredibly fun to watch. Some of them involve elaborate synchronized dances, in which the enemy (presumably against their will) joins the extra fighters for a few sweet seconds of booty shaking before the <i>coup de grace</i> is delivered. When the characters finally cooperatively attack their opponent, the screen explodes in a burst of color. The second way players can call their teammates into the action is by using the Team Up technique, in which one of the player\'s partners will jump into the battle to heal, power up or help buddy attack the mutual enemy. These Team Up moves can be countered by the newly added ""Team Up Technique Counter.""', 'The graphics in <i>Project Justice</i> are ultra-crisp, and even the backgrounds (though the color scheme might be a tad bland) are delightful eye candy of the highest quality. The characters look excellent, and there is enough extra motion going on in the background to keep even a passive observer entertained.', ""The game features five modes in all: Arcade, Versus, Training, League Battle and Tournament Battle. When playing in story mode, players start the game with three characters that represent one of the schools. It is up to players to move their teams up through the ranks, battling other trios from the rival schools. The story mode features some dialogue to explain the development of the plot -- but let's not fool ourselves, we don't play fighting games to read, we play them to fight. And the fighting in <i>Project Justice</i> is some of the most entertaining, action-packed battling we've seen on the Dreamcast for some time."", ""The control handles a lot like the <i>Street Fighter</i> games, and the game actually feels a lot like a 2D fighter with really good graphics, until players master the side step. The control set up, attack timing and combos are all pretty standard. As we stated earlier, it's in the special attacks that this game really shines."", '<i>Project Justice</i> should hit the stores in mid-January, and Sega Radar will be right there with a full review the day the game comes out.

Star Wars: X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Prepare yourself for the fight of your life and choose your craft, weapons, and wingmates carefully--the fate of the galaxy depends on it! Dive into all-out dogfights against up to seven other players in <i>X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter</i>. The game even includes the story-driven Balance of Power campaigns. Multiplayer options include up to four players over the Internet or up to eight players via a LAN.', 'Very few gamers were entirely satisfied with X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter when it was originally released last summer. In fact, to many gamers, it was both one of the most eagerly anticipated and ultimately one of the most disappointing games of 1997. Critics noted the lack of support for 3D accelerator cards; the omission of several of the more powerful fighters from past games in the series, such as the B-Wing and TIE Defender; the cartoonish cockpit graphics; and the visually disproportionate size of the apparently puny Imperial Star Destroyers. But the most frequently expressed complaint of disgruntled purchasers was that Totally Games and LucasArts, by concentrating almost exclusively on providing a multiplayer dogfighting arena, had abandoned the storyline-driven gameplay of previous games in the series. X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter provided no storyline, no campaigns, no dramatic cutscenes, and overall, a poor single-player experience. Fortunately, Balance of Power does an admirable job of addressing almost all the complaints gamers had with the original game.', 'Balance of Power includes two separate 15-mission campaigns - one for the Imperial forces and one for the Rebel forces. In the Rebel missions you\'ll be on the defensive from the outset, scrambling to regroup your forces in order to fend off, and ultimately destroy, a large Imperial fleet equipped with a gigantic Super Star Destroyer. Ye of little faith who thought LucasArts could never properly depict the size of a massive ship like the Super Star Destroyer will be suitably humbled the first time you lay your eyes on this beast. Although an epic ""attack the Death Star"" mission is still missing, challenging the city-sized Super Star Destroyer provides an apt substitute. The Imperial campaign involves chasing down the Rebels and preventing them from establishing a new Starship Shipyard. Every time you manage to complete five missions in a campaign, you are rewarded with a well-produced cutscene (six in total) that advances the campaign storyline in a compelling manner (and in the largely nameless/faceless X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter universe, which usually means a computer-generated sequence with a lot of ships blowing up). Best of all, the campaigns can be played through by a group of players as cooperative multiplayer missions. After you complete a campaign mission, you can replay it as a training mission.', 'The missions in the campaigns are refreshingly varied in their objectives and design and are, paradoxically, both the best addition to X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter and the cause of the most frustration. A number of the campaign missions are extremely difficult for a single player to successfully complete on the default difficulty level. Since tasks (which are occasionally unintuitive) often have to be carried out in a particular sequence, too many of the missions end up feeling puzzle-like, requiring you to figure out exactly where you have to go at different stages of the mission in order to be successful. Anyone familiar with Lawrence Holland\'s other games, Like X-Wing, Tie Fighter, and Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe won\'t be surprised by the occasionally devilishly challenging mission. But it\'s ironic that the campaigns in Balance of Power were arguably included to provide a better single-player experience, and yet they are extremely difficult for a single player to complete on the default difficulty level. Fortunately there are easier skill levels for frustrated gamers to meekly resort to and even a harder one for gamers who are ""one with the force."" You can also play each mission from the perspective of different flight groups, which enhances replayability by giving you different (often more challenging) mission objectives, and gives you additional opportunities to experiment with the Rebel B-Wing fighter (which is usually not your default choice).', 'For an affordably priced expansion pack, Balance of Power provides outstanding value. In addition to the campaigns and cutscenes, Balance of Power also adds eight new separate ""combat engagements"" (single missions to accomplish specified objectives), one new ""battle"" in which you can link the combat engagements together, and two melees (free-for-all shoot-em-ups). While the only new ship available to you is the Rebel B-Wing fighter, Balance of Power also adds five new capital ships (including the formidable Super Star Destroyer), two new starship bases, and a new gun emplacement platform. Although a 3D patch for X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter was made available some time ago, Balance of Power does automatically add the latest version of the patch and cleans up a few textures. You can now program your own ""taunts"" to gleefully mock your hapless foes. Finally, Balance of Power adds the familiar ""white streaks of light"" hyperspace effect, which was notably absent from the original game. Gamers who have been disappointed by uninspired expansion packs that haphazardly slap together a bunch of single-player missions, throw in a couple of new multiplayer arenas and a handful of units, and call it a day, will be pleasantly surprised with Balance of Power. Balance of Power provides more gameplay than most full games. The only things missing are new sound effects and (Star Wars-fan sacrilege alert!) new music. Don\'t get me wrong - I love John William\'s Star Wars music as much as the next guy, but hasn\'t LucasArts milked the Star Wars theme songs enough? Keep the classic music (what Star Wars game would be complete without the Imperial March), but let\'s have a few new chords next time.', ""Minor complaints aside, Totally Games and LucasArts have finally delivered the game that was so anxiously anticipated prior to X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter's release. Balance of Power perhaps arrives a little late, but it is certainly successful in making X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter one of the best games to be released in 1997 - and is still the only multiplayer space sim worth its weight in Jawas. <i>--Desslock</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

You must lead the resistance against the vile Trade Federation while Queen Amidala pleads Naboo's case before the Senate on Coruscant. A variety of new and familiar <i>Star Wars</i> vehicles are ready to be used in 16 land, sea, and air levels. The original story line features several combat scenarios, including air-to-air, ground-to-ground, and air-to-ground battles. The difficulty settings are adjustable, so even a Gungan can have a blast."", 'Recently LucasArts made the excellent decision to begin partnerships with first-rate developers. So Verant is working on its online game, BioWare is handling its RPG and Ensemble will be doing its RTS. In the meantime, PC gamers have to navigate around such lackluster titles as <i>Star Wars: Battle for Naboo</i>. It is an utterly routine shooter with a handful of different ships to fly, awkward controls, and robotic enemies that on their worst day aren\'t so much dangerous as they are sort of ""pesky."" Considering that the game is almost identical to the Nintendo64 version, it\'s not surprising to find bland textures, poor draw distances, flat models and small, uninspired levels. Feel free to come up with your own Jar-Jar reference now.It only makes sense for companies like Factor 5 to port a game like this to the PC. It\'s already done all the work for the Nintendo64 version, so why not take a few extra weeks to put it out for the desktop as well? There may be some younger Star Wars fans who would get a kick out of this mildly challenging twitch fest, but if you are the sort of gamer that puts off crucial surgery to save up for a GeForce 3, then you don\'t need this game.', 'In <i>Battle for Naboo</i>, players take control of Gavyn Sykes, a Lieutenant in Queen Amidala\'s Royal Security Forces. We would like to give you some idea of the character of Lt. Sykes, but with the minor exception of the obligatory ""Star Wars crawl"" opening description, players never even see this guy. We hear his voice quite often, but with only paltry in-engine cutscenes, what little plot the game has becomes fairly incidental to the experience. Suffice it to say that the Trade Federation has gathered some droids from central casting to shake things up a bit on Naboo, and it is your job to stop them.', ""Throughout the game players will switch - sometimes in mid-mission - among seven different vehicles. The Flash Speeder, for example, is just like the one Luke drove in <i>Star Wars</i>; the Heavy STAP is a floating gun deck that handles exactly like the Speeder; the Police Cruiser and the N-1 are nearly identical fighters; and a gunboat and bomber complete the limited palette of vehicles. To be fair, many good games only have one vehicle, so even a limited selection of very similar crafts isn't a debilitating weakness.."", ""However, whether players have one or a one hundred vehicles, none of them are fun to drive with awkward controls. <i>Battle for Naboo</i> has to be played with a joystick or an analog gamepad, as a digital pad is just about useless. Although the in-game options screen has a rumble effect option, we couldn't get any rumble effect in our Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 joysticks or in Interact's Hammerhead FX rumblepad. However, that may be due to some minor technical glitch or the fact that <i>Battle for Naboo</i> requires - and includes - DirectX 8a."", ""Moving through the game's various menus is pain-free, and piloting and shooting at the same time is fairly smooth, thanks to the forgiving aiming system. All the major functions -- such as primary and secondary fire, rotating the view and using the brake and accelerator -- were pretty easy. The only problem is that, because almost all the crafts require players to constantly move forward with no ability to stop, turning in tight quarters is a pain. This brings up different difficulties in space as well, where an invisible wall would suddenly turn our ship to the side, leaving us disoriented."", 'But even with improved controls, the boring graphics would be enough for us not to recommend this game. PCs have simply come too far for them to be tethered to a game that was roughly designed for the aging Nintendo64. The textures are boring and low-res, and the models are very crude, with the trees employing the classic <i>EverQuest</i> model of two leaf textures put together at right angles. The sky textures are bland, there are no interesting lighting or particle effects, the pop-in is terrible on some levels, and there are occasional clipping problems when running in the world.', ""There are only 15 levels in <i>Battle for Naboo</i>, although secret levels can be unlocked by finding hidden items during the game. There are also bronze, silver and gold awards for completing certain challenges, which is a clever way to add some replay value to an otherwise anemic title. There is no multiplayer option, but we weren't exactly dying to fire up GameSpy and test it out anyway. It's not a horrible game, but having played <i>StarFighter</i> on the PS2, we know what a good-looking shooter in the <i>Episode I</i> universe looks like -- and this isn't it. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>""]","by

Today, in 2093, nobody remembers the way the world was before. The leaders have successfully misplaced history, and people know the ruling Nazism as the everyday reality. But life is never that simple. One of the military scientists, Gen. Jurgen Mortyr, and his science crew have connected the growing number of world's disasters, weather, and gravity anomalies with the development and usage of a still-secret time machine. Tests have confirmed the theory that the time travels indeed are the cause of growing cataclysms. Very soon, the cataclysms are due to connect into a great collapse that would destroy the planet. Thus Jurgen and his cooperatives make the only possible decision--to destroy this line of time, to bring life back as it should be.

Total Annihilation (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['In Total Annihilation, you are a commander who can build an entire complex war. You can manipulate matter at an atomic level--but so can your enemy. Find a way to conquer the enemy and end the threat to universal existence. Battle with realistic firing cannons and nukes on diverse terrain, including canyons and molten riverbeds. Total Annihilation challenges you to set a new standard for combat strategy.', 'The gaming industry is gearing up to bury consumers under an avalanche of real-time strategy games. Every developer is touting the one or two features that will help its game to ""redefine the genre"" - but the majority of these features do nothing but take away from the precarious balance which made the big two - Warcraft II and Command & Conquer - such runaway hits. At first glance, Total Annihilation, with its much ballyhooed 3D terrain and more than ten dozen units, appears to be nothing more than another in a long line of real-time games with a few minor innovations. But in this case, the innovations work. Cavedog has done a commendable job of taking the basic mechanics of real-time strategy and using them to create something new: A game that relies less on constant mouse-clicking than careful planning and strategic thinking. <P> Initial impressions of Total Annihilation may be misleading. Fire up a campaign and the first few missions will seem like nothing more than another Command & Conquer clone, albeit one with strikingly realistic terrain and a great symphonic score. But as you play deeper into the game, or play a few multiplayer battles or skirmish missions where your opponent is less forgiving, the complexities of the game begin to become apparent. Total Annihilation is a game about balance, from the tightly interwoven resource management scheme to the very diverse units. <P> It\'s hard to talk about one without the other, and resource management provides a great tightrope you must walk to keep the army strong, both in numbers and brute force. You need the two resources in the game (metal and energy) to power and build your units. Unfortunately, metal is usually rather scarce in the early parts of a mission (later you can salvage wreckage from destroyed units), but you can build generators to convert energy to metal. This solution to the metal shortage poses another problem entirely: Your units need energy to fire their weapons, and these generators use a great deal of power to produce a small amount of metal. Building a massive army of units is fine, but won\'t help you much if you don\'t have enough energy to keep them firing. <P> The units themselves - robotic mechs, vehicles, aircraft, and naval vessels - provide more to the balancing challenge. The stronger units are devastating but require a great deal of power and move very slowly. Large tanks and ships take a great deal of time to simply turn and fire at a target, and large bombers often must traverse the entire length of a map to turn around and make a second run. As a result, you must create balanced forces, small units to hold the enemy while the big guns ready themselves. There\'s no ""ultimate weapon"" like Red Alert\'s Mammoth Tank or Warcraft II\'s Ogre Magi - there are only more powerful weapons that have equally powerful disadvantages. And then there\'s the Commander, your strongest unit, your fastest builder and possessor of the devastating D-Gun that destroys units with a single shot. The Commander provides another great strategic conundrum - he\'s your best warrior, but it\'s risky to send him into battle because once the Commander\'s gone, the mission is over. <P> Total Annihilation is full of great features. The 3D terrain - pre-rendered maps with tall mountains and deep valleys - plays an important part in strategy, as units situated at higher elevations have a much wider firing range. Units can take cover behind trees, but these trees - and whole forests - can go up in flames with a single stray shot. When units are destroyed, complete with bass-heavy explosions and a slight shaking of the map, shrapnel flies everywhere, and structures and troops unlucky enough to be hit by the flying debris take damage, adding to the need for strategic placement - just standing and firing at the enemy will cause your units to get destroyed very quickly. <P> Your units gain experience, and with five kills they become veterans with much more accurate firing ability. You can also give units numerous commands at once (simply by holding down the shift key), so that minor tasks can be queued while you go off to worry about more important matters. These types of details make Total Annihilation great, and every time you play you\'ll discover some subtle little feature that makes you want to change your tactics and try something new. <P> There are a few small details that could have been improved. The opening missions of the Core campaign are set on a metallic backdrop that is somewhat confusing, making the area in your line of sight and grayed-out; invisible areas look very similar. The manual is a little on the skimpy side, and the lack of any tutorial to demonstrate the game\'s mechanics seems like an oversight, especially in a game where many players will bring tried-and-true real-time tactics, only to find they\'re almost completely useless. There\'s also the lack of a dedicated server for Internet play and the noticeable lack of a scenario editor. Finally, there\'s the Commander AI bug, which makes the enemy AI send his Commander into battle early on in skirmish missions, causing most to only last a few minutes (Cavedog has promised that a patch for this problem will be released shortly). <P> But in the face of all that is right about Total Annihilation, these minor details are fairly easily overlooked. If you\'re looking for a real-time strategy game that adds some new features without breaking from the standard formula, Total Annihilation may be too foreign to satisfy your needs. But if you\'re looking for a game that is challenging and rewarding on entirely new levels, Total Annihilation is highly recommended. <i>--Ron Dulin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Mild-mannered factory worker Abe has discovered that his employers at Rupture Farms are planning to use his fellow Mudokons as the main ingredient in their latest product, Mudokon Pops. Like any decent Mudokon, Abe aims to rescue his peers. He also is determined to seek justice in his battle to bring down the corrupt Rupture Farms. You help Abe carry out his heroic duties by possessing enemies, participating in action sequences worthy of an <I>Indiana Jones</I> flick, and talking to fellow Mudokons using the game\'s impressive ""gamespeak"" feature, which allows multiple characters to communicate with each other using your control pad.', 'The graphics in <I>Abe\'s Oddyssee</I> convey a unique personality, which is often lacking in platform action games. Still, a few pretty game environments will not distract you from the devious puzzles scattered throughout the game. Fortunately, you never run out of lives in <I>Oddworld: Abe\'s Oddysee</I>. Instead, Abe rematerializes immediately after you ""die"" and the game continues from the last checkpoint you reached. This approach encourages exploration, which you\'ll want to do anyway since this is one of the most beautiful 2-D games we\'ve seen. <i>--T. Byrl Baker</i>', '<b>Pros:</b><br> <ul> <li>Gorgeous graphics and cut-scenes <li>Challenging puzzles <li>Entertaining story </ul> <b>Cons:</b><br> <ul> <li>Many puzzles require perfect timing, which can be difficult to master </ul>', 'If there ever was a cookie-cutter genre in gaming, it was the platform game back in the heyday of 16-bit console systems. Every company had a ""cute"" or ""hot-licensed"" character it wanted to plug into a 2D side scroller. It really didn\'t matter if the titles were any good - and more often than not, they weren\'t. Gameplay frustrations such as blind jumps and opponents that would fire projectiles at players from off-screen quickly became commonplace, and people walked away from the whole mess scared and scarred. Consequently, gamers believed that games had to be 3D to be any good. Now, Oddworld: Abe\'s Oddysee has arrived, proving people wrong on both regards. Abe\'s is not only a platform game for people who are tired of platform games - it\'s one for people who never liked them to begin with. <P>In Oddworld, you play a slave called Abe, who works at the meat-processing plant Rupture Farms. Abe\'s a Mudokon, hardly your typical cute platform hero, but a gangly, orange-eyed, green-skinned creature with a samurai\'s tuft of hair and the posture of an ape. The story\'s premise is that the factory\'s owners have found a tasty new treat to whip into production since they ran their last ""dish"" into extinction. The problem is, it\'s you. Or more precisely, the Mudokons. When an eavesdropping Abe finds this out, he starts ham-stepping stage left, right quick, proving that curiosity can save the cat, too. Your goal, as Abe, is to escape Rupture Farms, liberating as many fellow Mudokons as possible, and find a way to bring down the entire plant. But playing a Christ figure isn\'t as easy as we\'d all like to think. Using a limited vocabulary set, Abe must convince the Mudokons to follow him to safety, all the while racing through the factory flipping switches, avoiding obstacles, evading heavily armed guards, and staying alive. <P>While other games promise a variety of enemies and enemy AI, Abe\'s delivers, with creatures such as the Sligs (the heavily armed guards of Rupture Farms who are basically slugs with guns on stilts), Paramites (Giger face-hugger-like creatures), Scrabs (essentially four fast-moving legs with a sharp beak), and Slogs (the Sligs\' fleshy-headed ""dogs""). Each species has its own unique personality, which has to be understood and adapted to if Abe has any hope of surviving. For example, the Paramites get quite vicious if cornered or found in groups, but can be distracted if you throw them chunks of meat; the Scrabs fight like beta fish if you can lead them into the same room; the Sligs can be controlled by Abe\'s psychic ability, if no mind-control-inhibiting machinery is nearby; and the Slogs, in turn, can be ordered around by possessed Sligs. The game\'s developers, Oddworld Inhabitants, refer to the creature AI process as A.L.I.V.E. (Alive Lifeforms In a Virtual Environment), and it goes a long way toward making you feel as if you\'re interacting with an actual world and all its inhabitants. <P>Other variations from the platform norm include the absence of scoring (the goal is just to stay alive and save your friends, not rack up points), life meters (you\'ll know when you\'ve expired), or extra lives (after death you simply start back at the beginning of the section you were in). Once you realize these features are gone, you\'ll probably begin wondering why games ever needed them in the first place. Best yet, unlike any number of platformers, Oddworld: Abe\'s Oddysee requires lots of thinking in solving its puzzles, which are well constructed and challenging, instead of cheap and frustrating.

Already one of the most massive role-playing games in memory--especially if you add the original <i>Baldur's Gate</i> and <i>Tales of the Sword Coast</i> expansion pack--the Baldur's Gate series has provided, easily, 300 hours of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Second Edition role-playing genius. Now, just when you've got your life back, and, maybe, finished <i>BGII</i>, the company goes and releases the new <i>BGII</i> expansion pack <i>Throne of Bhaal</i>."", ""<i>BGII</i> is already so huge one might wonder why you would need or want an expansion. Is it because there are hordes of additional monsters to fight, a couple new classes and kits to explore (the Wild Mage, for example), new treasures and artifacts, new quests and dungeons, and the ability to reach an unprecedented 40th level? Well, yes, those are pretty much the reasons why. Why wouldn't you want to meet strange new creatures, unleash strange new spells, and listen to even more bizarre voice acting from the lovable Minsc? But the real reason to get this one is to see the massive story finally reach a conclusion. There won't be a <i>Baldur's Gate III</i> folks, and <i>Throne of Bhaal</i> lets you see the fate of the character that debuted as Gorion's young ward so many years ago in the original <i>Baldur's Gate</i>."", ""This is an expansion, not a sequel, and thus the game mechanics and animation are pretty much the same as in <i>Baldur's Gate II</i>. With no new animation, save the new spells, and only a handful of new beasts, this game doesn't innovate--it adds to the overall experience. Naturally, it's fully playable in multiplayer mode, and you can start anew with one of the new classes or continue with your old character. <i>--Andrew S. Bub</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b>', '']","by

The Super Hornet is a carrier-based, multi-role attack fighter capable of striking almost anywhere in the world, thanks to the global range of the U.S. Navy's carrier strike forces and the increased combat radius of the new Super Hornet. Earlier versions of the F-18, launching from carriers in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, decimated Iraqi positions in operation Desert Storm and have been immortalized in countless Hollywood productions. Featuring a bigger weapons load, faster top speeds, a stealthier radar signature, and countless technological advancements over its predecessors, the F/A-18 Super Hornet will lead U.S. carrier-launched air assaults well into the new millennium."", 'Simulation is a deceiving word as far as games are concerned. Everyone wants a simulation, but not everyone can agree on the meaning of the term; all flight simulations purport to simulate something, yet the level of realism gamers desire or the specific elements gamers most want simulated vary greatly. A game that tries to comprehensively model one particular aspect of air combat can end up depending on that element to carry the entire game, and it will appeal mostly to gamers who find that facet particularly important. Many such flight simulations compete for best graphics, best flight model, or most detailed avionics in the genre. However, Jane\'s F/A-18 makes no attempt to excel in any particular category. Does that make the game a poor simulation? Hardly. Remarkably, Jane\'s F/A-18 succeeds in being a superb flight simulator without being truly exceptional in any specific area. The terrain graphics (with the exception of clouds and lighting) are not much better than in F-15, whose graphics engine was obviously refitted for use in F/A-18. The game\'s cockpits are entirely 3D and can be difficult to read at times. While the campaign has some variable elements, it\'s essentially scripted. In fact, at first it\'s unclear as to what makes F/A-18 such a good simulation, even as you play it into the early hours of the morning. But that\'s precisely the appeal of Jane\'s F/A-18: The game does a tremendous job of putting you in the game world, despite the its apparent technical shortcomings. While ""immersive"" is a word thrown around so frequently in game reviews that it\'s easy to ignore, the word does accurately describe Jane\'s F/A-18 because of how the different parts of the game mesh. The degree to which you actually feel as if you\'re taking part in the game\'s events is very noticeable. That\'s partly due to the game\'s focus on a carrier-based aircraft; the focus isn\'t just for the novelty of trying to systematically model serious carrier operations to a high level of detail. It\'s also for the more mundane - though probably more significant - reason that the carrier, unlike an airfield on land, gives you a very defined sense of ""home"" that adds immeasurably to the atmosphere of the simulation. There is something about limping back to the mother ship on one engine, with shot hydraulics and a thimbleful of gasoline, that engenders a sense of urgency utterly lacking in a similar approach to Tempelhof airfield, for example. In F/A-18\'s campaign, the USS Ronald Reagan isn\'t just a ship: It\'s your floating home off the shores of the enemy-held Kola Peninsula. And as your tailhook misses the arrestor wires and you hear ""Bolter-Bolter-Bolter!"" you\'ll practically feel as though you\'re being ripped from your mother\'s bosom as you\'re thrust out for another terrifying go-round. It\'s a detail that\'s anything but minor once you\'ve experienced it. To make the game feel so cohesive, its individual elements must be modeled realistically, and Jane\'s does an especially good job in several areas. The flight model is excellent, and if the F/A-18 seems to be having difficulty exiting controlled flight for an extended period, it\'s because of the fly-by-wire nature of the aircraft in which the control surfaces are adjusted by computer. Weapons are plentiful and are accurately modeled. The avionics appear simple but are comprehensive, because the cockpit displays contain a deceptively large amount of information. The only problem is with the 3D cockpit, which can be tricky to use as its various functions aren\'t always easy to read. Unfortunately, turning up the cockpit detail decreases the game\'s frame rate significantly, and it\'s a loss that you may not be able to justify, as the game\'s hardware requirements aren\'t trivial, even with the average terrain graphics. Don\'t expect to run Jane\'s F/A-18 at 1024x768 without a high-end Pentium III. Turning down the detail levels and running at a lower resolution will be necessary on slower machines. <i>--Bruce Geryk </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Console gamers now have a chance to do the same thing in <I>Record of Lodoss War</I>, a game that plays almost exactly like <I>Diablo</I>, but differently enough to make worth playing. Which isn't a bad thing -- after all, <I>Diablo</I> is a great game. The only think <I>Lodoss</I> is missing is online play. Even without it, though, the epic story and action-packed gameplay will surely appeal to anyone who enjoyed Blizzard's classic.<I>Record of Lodoss War</I> is based on the anime series of the same name, although the game takes place some time after the story in the series. Players control a mysterious hero who has been resurrected from the dead in order to fight evil and stomp the bad guys. The game is played from an isometric perspective, and controlling the hero is simplicity itself. A quick-access menu of all-important healing items is quick and easy to get to, although players can still open up a main display screen to play with stats and equip weapons and armor.<P>The sheer amount of variety when it comes to weapons and armor should be mentioned here. Players eventually get the chance to work with Artifacts -- inscriptions they can put on weapons to improve their abilities. Using a variety of Artifacts (which requires a pattern and special ore called Mithril) on a variety of weapons can yield a huge range of results. With enough patience and foresight, players can create some of the most deadly weapons ever seen in a role-playing game of this type. <P>And a role-playing game it is. There are plenty of stats for players to tinker with by equipping a variety of items. The main character has all the standards (strength, dexterity, intelligence), but there are others -- critical hit percentages, for example.<P>Eventually, players will team up with other characters to defeat hordes of baddies. The AI for the computer-controlled players isn't too bad -- they tend to get into the action nicely, anyway. But it still feels very much like these are just non-player characters along for the ride, like smart weapons, rather than other players who go off and do their own thing. <P>Magic is one of the more intriguing aspects of the game. In order to prepare a spell, players have to punch in a series of buttons on the controller to queue it up. That means that casting a spell in the middle of combat is a pain most players won't want to deal with, which is frustrating. But it makes sense -- after all, spells are complex.<P>Throughout the game the storyline unfolds, and as players begin to realize who they are and what they're up against, the epic plot become more and more engrossing. While the graphics aren't anything to look twice at (we're talking pretty basic visuals here), the action-packed pace and hordes of enemies to destroy are fun in a purely visceral way, while the storyline adds a bit of intellect to the whole thing.<P><B>The Bottom Line:</B> It's a nicely done <I>Diablo</I> clone, which means that it takes all the good bits and adds quite a few twists to make an entertaining romp through some diverse dungeons. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i>""]",Sega,"['>#53,396 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#166 in Video Games > More Systems > Sega Dreamcast > Games']",$99.99,Video Games,B000059Z7S

USAF - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""A straight line runs from Chuck Yeager's Air Combat, one of the most revered and influential PC flight sims, to Jane's new survey sim USAF. The Jane's tradition of accessible flight simulations with plenty of planes and options has given us Air Combat, US Navy Fighters, Advanced Tactical Fighters, and Israeli Air Force, with steady improvement and little deviation from the formula. USAF is no exception, but is poised to take the survey sim into new territory."", 'The appeal of this sort of simulation is because of several factors: It has a lot of planes, numerous gameplay options, and moderate realism levels. Together these three elements create a package that gives the more casual fan a taste of air combat without the burden of too much detail. Hard-core simulation fans often shun such games for these same reasons, because the generic controls and lack of extreme realism or detail seem too far removed from the real-world complexities of in-depth sims like Flanker 2.0 and Falcon.', ""There's no question that USAF falls in the midrange on the realism scale. With eight flyable planes, you can't expect the refined flight model and sophisticated avionics of a stand-alone simulation. But for this trade-off you get those eight planes, each with unique cockpits and distinct, if not precise, flight models. To simplify things, controls are shared among the eight planes, so that the F-117 uses the same radar functions as the F-16, and so on."", ""USAF pushes the envelope by taking on several generations of air combat. Planes and missions come from Vietnam, the Gulf War, and the near future, creating a broad canvas of action rarely seen in a flight sim. You can fly in the F-15, F-16, F-22, F-117, F4, MiG 29, F-105, and A-10, plus some variations on these. This diversity serves as a sort of history lesson on the development of jet combat, as you go from the fast gunfights and rudimentary radar of the F-105 and F4 to the hi-tech stealth precision of the F-22. All three eras (past, present, and future) are ably served by full-blown campaigns illustrating the many roles of air combat. The four campaigns include a present-day training situation, Vietnam, the Gulf War, and a hypothetical near-future European conflict. Campaigns are semidynamic, meaning the missions are scripted with some randomization, and resources are tracked throughout the course of the campaign. If you use missiles and lose airframes carelessly, you'll probably find yourself short on funds later in the campaign. It's not the true dynamic battlefield found in the likes of Longbow and Falcon, but the missions are tight and the campaigns are satisfying."", ""The rest of the play options feature the stunning array of game types that are the trademark of the Jane's line. You can create almost any encounter you want with a quick mission option. Air-to-air and strike missions can be configured to pit any aircraft or group against any other in any situation, altitude, and position of advantage. Want to try a wing of Phantoms against a single Strike Eagle? It will take you about a minute. You can also simply start a random quick mission that will choose all these settings for you. Scripted stand-alone missions take on specific historical encounters and elaborate hypothetical scenarios that cover the entire range of air combat. USAF is playable online via Jane's Combat.net matching service, and will also form the core of the forthcoming Jane's World War: a massively multiplayer persistent-world air-combat arena. It will be your first point of entry to this ambitious project, but the beta and final launch dates of Jane's World War are uncertain as of this time."", ""Visually, USAF is inconsistent. The detail on the planes and objects is good, and while terrain looks decent from high altitudes, you'll see some real problems with it once you get down low. The landscape textures have visible seams. There's also an odd kind of texture pop-in as the terrain visibly smoothes during flight. Even the trees and bushes look funny: small, blinking, and quite distracting. Frame rates are adequate on a high-powered system, but the terrain problems in Pixel's Israeli Air Force persist in this newer simulation. In high-altitude aircraft this isn't a problem, but with the mud runs of the A-10 and F15, it becomes more of an issue."", ""Graphical flaws aside, USAF continues a revered tradition of accessible and diverse Jane's flight simulations. There are more missions and planes in this one package than in a dozen other recent sims, and its diverse features and the important place USAF will have in Jane's World War will keep it flying for a long, long time to come. <i>--Tony Lopez</i>"", '--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Escape from Monkey Island - Mac,,[],"['Video Games', 'Mac', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<i>Escape from Monkey Island</i> continues in the hilarious tradition of its critically hailed and award-winning predecessors, <i>The Secret of Monkey Island</i>, <i>Monkey Island 2: Le Chuck's Revenge</i>, and <i>The Curse of Monkey Island</i>. Developed by the team who created LucasArts's irreverent classic <i>Sam and Max Hit the Road</i>, <i>Escape</i> features an original cinematic story full of drama, intrigue, and of course, sidesplitting humor. The game is highlighted by hundreds of challenging puzzles, set amidst dozens of rich and brilliantly rendered backgrounds."", ""The day fast approaches when Guybrush Threepwood, Elaine Marley-Threepwood, Stan of Stan's Previously Owned Vessels, and the other bizarre characters from the beloved, anachronistic <i>Monkey</i> series come back to PC shores."", ""In contrast to most LucasArts adventures, the Monkey Island games have always been really over the top. Whereas games like Full Throttle and Grim Fandango emphasized character and story, the Monkey Island games have increasingly leaned toward trying to make you laugh by means of an endless barrage of puns and pop-culture references. This is true of Escape from Monkey Island, the fourth game in the series. Much of it is funny, although a lot of it isn't. This inconsistency winds through the whole game, from the puzzles to the interface. When it's good, Escape from Monkey Island is very, very good. But the game's missteps do detract from the overall experience."", ""In this chapter of Guybrush Threepwood's adventures, the self-proclaimed mighty pirate and his new bride, Governor Elaine Marley, have returned from their honeymoon only to find that Elaine has been declared dead. This incorrect declaration has ended her lifetime term as governor, so she must now run against Charles L. Charles, a foppish glad-hander with a dark secret. What adds to the political intrigue is that the pirate hangouts in the Tri-Island area are being bought up and made into tourist-friendly venues like StarBuccaneer's and Planet Threepwood, thanks to an Australian land developer named Ozzie Mandrill. To top it all off, everyone seems to be looking for a voodoo artifact called the Ultimate Insult. These events aren't as unrelated as they may seem, and Guybrush must help Elaine stop the gentrification of his stomping grounds and find the Ultimate Insult before it falls into the wrong hands."", ""To reach these ends, Guybrush must once again explore the strange Caribbean Islands that surround his home, Melee Island. He'll visit Jambalaya Island (the island most affected by Mandrill's takeover) and Lucre Island and once again return to the titular Monkey Island itself. Many of the locales will be familiar to longtime fans of the series, as will a number of the characters. LeChuck, Murray the skull, Herman Toothrot, Otis, Carla, Meathook, and many, many others make guest appearances. In fact, there may even be too many cameos by old favorites."", ""There's an old joke. A guy walks into a bar and notices people keep yelling out numbers, and everyone in the bar busts up laughing. He asks the bartender what's going on. The bartender tells him that the regulars have told the same jokes for so long that now they just refer to them by number. Much of the humor in Escape from Monkey Island is like this. Many jokes allude to earlier events in the series, and they're only funny if you're familiar with the references. For instance, the fact that Otis the pirate likes flowers is a gag from the first game, and here it seems like the designers are simply pointing it out, hoping you'll remember how funny it was the first time around."", ""It's true that Escape from Monkey Island does have plenty of new gags and characters, and many of them are really funny. The talking figurehead on Guybrush's new ship is particularly amusing, as are characters like Pegnose Pete; Marco de Pollo, the world's greatest cliff diver; and Miss Rivers, the teacher at the pirate reformation academy. The humor is enhanced by the universally excellent voice work. But some of the new characters aren't quite as interesting. Ozzie Mandrill, the evil real estate developer, is only funny if you think simply being Australian is funny - although his particular way of talking does lend itself to a very surreal match of Insult Sword Fighting, one of the more humorous sequences in the game."", ""The bout with Ozzie is the only appearance of the preferred dueling technique in the Tri-Island area. This time, you'll learn Insult Arm Wrestling and Monkey Kombat, a variation on the Insult competition and a parody of the fighting game Mortal Kombat. The concept is funny, but unfortunately Monkey Kombat may be the single biggest problem with Escape from Monkey Island. You must learn to trade barbs in the monkey language, and it all builds up to a really funny parody of Mortal Kombat's famous opening. But the art of Monkey Kombat itself is a frustrating one."", 'Monkey Kombat is a more complicated version of rock-paper-scissors - it features five fighting stances, each of which beats two other stances. You must say three of the four monkey words (""eek,"" ""ooop,"" ""chee,"" ""ack"") in a certain order to change stances, and each transition is unique. So, Drunken Monkey to Anxious Ape (and vice versa) might be ""ack eek oop,"" while Charging Chimp to Anxious Ape might be ""eek chee ack."" These only ""might be"" the right combinations, because the combinations and hierarchy are randomized with each new game. The only way to learn the art is through trial and error and copious note taking, and it becomes tiresome quickly. However, Monkey Kombat plays a principal part in the entire last third of the game.', ""The biggest change in Escape from Monkey Island from previous installments is that it uses a modified version of the Grim Fandango engine and interface. Grim Fandango was the first LucasArts game to use fully 3D characters on 2D prerendered backgrounds. It also featured a fully integrated keyboard interface that was designed to keep you firmly rooted in the reality of the game. Like Grim Fandango, Escape from Monkey Island uses 3D characters and 2D backgrounds, and it's a testament to the great artistic design that the game manages both to evoke and to improve upon the surreal pirate world that made its predecessor, Curse of Monkey Island, such a beautiful-looking game. The characters themselves fare a bit worse in Escape from Monkey Island, if only because they seem less expressive in 3D, but they still look great."", ""The only problem with the use of the Grim Fandango engine is the interface. Escape from Monkey Island dispenses with the basic concept of Grim Fandango's simple, text-free interface and instead reverts to making you choose from a series of text options and sort your inventory using a more conventional menu. Cycling through the possible actions in any location is a bit cumbersome, and at times it seems like the game would have been much easier to control with a standard mouse interface - though the designers did add some funny bits that you'll discover when you're sorting through your inventory in front of other characters."", ""You'll be cycling through your inventory often. The puzzles in Escape from Monkey Island primarily involve using objects in your inventory in creative ways, and many of these puzzles are good. But there are a few that make no sense at all, even in the bizarre world of the game. Finding Pegnose Pete's hideout requires a leap of logic that is baffling, and even after you finally locate the hideout, the solution makes little sense. But just as LucasArts was the first adventure-game maker to ensure that players would never die in a game, the company seems to be taking an equally strong stance against players getting stuck. Clues abound throughout the game, and a full walk-through is even included in the box - a bonus that seems as cynical as it is helpful."", ""Escape from Monkey Island is a great game that can be frustrating. At times it'll seem as if there were simply too many designers working on it and everyone wanted their ideas included. The puzzles are hit and miss, and so are the jokes. This is best illustrated by the traditional LucasArts post-credits joke, in this case a string of pop-culture references that goes on and on, as if no one could decide which of them were funny so they just decided to leave them all. But in most cases, the game can be a real pleasure to play, because enough of the puzzles are good and enough of the jokes are amusing. As such, veterans of the Monkey Island series will surely enjoy the game in spite of its occasional problems. However, players who're new to the Monkey Island series may get the sense while playing the game that they're watching a bunch of old friends regale each other with old in-jokes; it's easy to feel as if you're being left out of the fun if you don't catch the references. So while new players should approach the game with caution, if you're a fan of the previous installments, then Escape from Monkey Island is highly recommended.<i>--Ron Dulin </i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc.

Sid Meier's Gettysburg (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['This real-time game by the master of historical games, Sid Meier, simulates one of the most dramatic battles in history. It takes into account all the factors of a bloody battle, including morale, formation, terrain, and firepower.', 'Sid Meier\'s Gettysburg! may be the first release from newcomer Firaxis Games, but it has all the polish and appeal of a Meier classic. This outstanding real-time wargame recreates the pivotal, three-day Civil War battle fought on the rolling terrain around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in July 1863. <P> Playing from either side of the conflict, you can take part in a single scenario or a campaign depicting the entire battle. Campaigns typically comprise seven scenarios and are dynamically strung together according to your performance in battle. For example, if you and the Confederate army can rewrite history and capture the high ground south of Gettysburg on July 1, you can earn the option of launching a fictional evening assault on Culp\'s Hill. In all, the game includes 25 predesigned scenarios, along with a random scenario option that allows for near-endless replay value. Also contributing to the game\'s replay value is the fact that no two campaigns unfold in exactly the same way. All of the scenarios are available in both single-player and multiplayer mode, but the game does not include a scenario editor. <P> Right from the start, Gettysburg! draws you in with its elegant interface and rich artwork. A nicely animated briefing prefaces each of the scenarios and adds tremendous atmosphere. Once you transition to the gameplay screen, you get more preliminary information, including a rundown of your objectives, your best troops, and the availability of reserves and reinforcements. In most scenarios, you will command a few brigades of infantry (each made up of three to five regiments) with at least one battery of artillery in support. <P> As a scenario begins, you must very quickly assess your situation and issue orders to redeploy your troops, as the default start positions are rarely effective. The clock is ticking, but the clean interface makes it easy to issue orders. To move a regiment, simply click on it and drag a line to the desired destination. You can move entire brigades this way as well, though the process is not as intuitive as it could be: You must select the brigade\'s commanding general, drag a line to the destination, then choose a formation for the brigade to assume upon reaching that spot. <P> Each unit\'s movement and fighting quality is affected by a variety of conditions, including its formation, experience, morale, and location. For example, a regiment with friendly units on either side will fight more effectively than one that is being flanked. Similarly, units ordered to charge a hill bristling with artillery will take a serious morale hit (not to mention several large, round iron hits) and will probably soon retreat in disarray. <P> Each scenario lasts about 30 minutes, but the computer will add some time at the end if one side is within striking distance of an objective. In other words, you don\'t win when you capture an objective - you win when you capture and hold it. <P> As in the real battle, the high ground is the key to victory and you won\'t have any trouble finding it on the beautifully rendered battle maps. Capturing that ground is another matter, as the AI can be quite formidable. Fortunately, the computer\'s style and effectiveness are completely customizable. Looking for a challenge? Try taking on an ""aggressive, indirect"" Confederate foe on the highest of the game\'s four difficulty settings. <P> The graphics and animation in Gettysburg! are excellent and show tremendous attention to detail. Best of all, the graphics convey a reasonably accurate sense of scale - these are huge armies we\'re talking about, after all. The sound effects are also admirable. Shots ring out, rebel yells rise above the din, and your troops will even shout out to indicate that they\'re being flanked. <P> On top of all this, the game offers excellent and apparently stable multiplayer support over TCP/IP, IPX, modem, and serial links.

It\'s easy to see why. There\'s little or no skill involved, and your fate is usually decided by the spin of the giant wheel. Pat Sajak and Vanna White have become household names from sea to shining sea. Zillions of hapless Americans tune in regularly to see who will walk away with the brand-new car, luxury vacation, or fabulous yacht. <P> The premise of the game is simple. You try to guess a person, place, or thing by choosing consonants and buying vowels. If you\'re lucky, your spin of the wheel lands you on a dollar amount (ranging from $250 to $10,000). If you choose a consonant that\'s in the mystery phrase, you get the dollar amount you spun multiplied by the number of occurrences in the phrase. For example, let\'s say you spun $500 and picked the letter T. The mystery phrase has four Ts, so you get $2,000. Vowels are purchased at $250 a pop. The wheel is also loaded with Bankrupts, Lose a Turns, and Surprises. If your letter guess isn\'t in the phrase, the wheel passes to the next player. <P> The trick of the game is to figure out what the phrase is quickly, then keep spinning until the last possible moment. This strategy of sorts works well, unless you happen to land on a Bankrupt or Lose a Turn. All this activity and puzzle solving sounds exciting, right? And it is, if you happen to be playing the game in the Sony Studios and actually have a chance at winning money or a prize. It\'s less fun watching it on TV at home; but there\'s still some drama and excitement, wondering what each player will do and, of course, solving the puzzle before any of the morons on TV can. <P> Although there doesn\'t seem to be a compelling reason to bring a game show like this to the PC, Hasbro will definitely have an audience amongst people who dream of being part of the action of a big-money American game show. But beyond that, what does this game really offer? <P> The game sets out right from the get-go to be as much like the TV show as possible. An emcee asks you simple questions to get you started and puts you in control of the wheel. That vicarious thrill alone will sell hundreds if not thousands of copies of this game. Not to mention the appearance of the one-and-only Vanna White as the show\'s host. Hasbro has cleverly integrated her FMV image dialogue into the show. Of course, at times, it\'s totally silly (there\'s this smiling clapping thing she does that pops up randomly that\'s just hilarious). But the dialogue and mannerisms are exactly as they are on the TV show (I watched it a few times just to make sure). It\'s the lack of human interaction that makes her appear so much sillier on the PC. <P> The point of view also changes constantly. Since I\'m not a regular viewer of the TV show (really, I\'m not), I found this irritating in the extreme. After watching a few shows, however, I realized this effect mimics the changing points of view on the set in an attempt - I\'m guessing - to elevate the level of excitement (sort of like that weird hopping camera on NYPD Blue makes it seem more ""real""). Another problem was that the mouse pointer used to select letters was slow, clunky, and often jumped around the screen in an alarming manner. I made many incorrect guesses and was chastised by Vanna for wasting time because I couldn\'t get my mouse pointer to simmer down and behave. <P> The first few games, I played against two computer opponents. Right from the start, I got the general impression that the computer-generated players were having a lot more fun than I was. (""Come on, baby! Big money! Big money!"") The game isn\'t even smart enough to give these poor hapless ghosts in my machine names. But when Computer Player 1 won the fantasy prize - an African ballooning safari - I had no doubt that she was soaring the skies of the Serengeti somewhere between my hard drive and my motherboard. I, on the other hand, could only imagine going on the luxury cruise I won and paddling my antique wood canoe in a pond that looked like it belonged in one of those bottled water ads. <P> The big problem I had with my exuberant opponents was that, unless I was in control of the wheel, I spent a lot of time watching my AI counterparts playing, guessing, spinning, and winning. Then, I wised up and played against myself (under assumed names, of course). But I have to say, the game soon palled. The mystery phrases were so simple, even I could guess them with only a few letters showing. I totally realize that the object of the game isn\'t really to guess some difficult phrase or use my brain in any way. The mystery phrase is just a vehicle of suspense for the greedy players. <P> But the worst part of Wheel of Fortune was the lack of reward. This is a game where the only reward is winning money and prizes. Imagining money and prizes is just not the same. Even watching other real live people win money and prizes on TV was better than imagining how I would spend my imaginary $50,000 while driving my imaginary Land Rover. Another couple of games, and I\'m cracking my computer case to join Computer Player 1 on her African ballooning safari. <i>--Nicole Freeman</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

It didn't have cutting-edge graphics or audio, but it played a deep amalgam of role-playing and real-time strategy, garnering critical praise and more than a few fans. Whether you played it or not is immaterial to enjoyment of this sequel. There are enough changes in <I>Magic & Mayhem: The Art of Magic</I> to make it an entirely new game, plus this one is more of a prequel, as it takes place a half century before the events in the first game."", ""<I>The Art of Magic</I>'s story can at best be described as tried and true, and at worst clich&eacute;d. You play a magically inclined farm boy named Aurax who wakes up one morning to find his sister Nadia under attack by goblins and other monsters. The pair fights off the bad guys, heads to town, and finds it under siege by the fearsome Goblin King. During the battle to defend hearth and home, Nadia gets captured, and Aurax, as any good magically inclined farm boy inevitably must do, has to rescue his sister from the clutches of an evil wizard and steal back powerful magical orbs of power, thus saving the world. The story is well told through non-player character (NPC) conversations, and the designers made sure the missions in the campaign mode are varied and interesting (there are also skirmish and multiplayer modes). One mission involves the aforementioned Goblin King, another has you storming a troll fortress for an artifact, and others have you fighting various evil wizards, sometimes in tandem, for territory or artifacts."", ""All three play modes basically center on what the game calls Places of Power. You've got to stand on one of these, or summon a creature to stand there for you, and this helps your spell power recharge more quickly. Because conflicts against enemy wizards (especially in multiplayer or skirmish modes) generally devolve into battles of inches, taking and controlling these places is extremely important."", ""During the game you can recruit allies, like an archer or warrior, while looking for items to combine so you can access a whole host of spells. Picking which spells you want to use--and gathering the materials necessary to cast them--really affects your play style. You can spend your time and items creating defensive spells, or instead opt for an offensive strategy. The AI does a good job of learning your playing style and trying to counter it. By far your most important magic is summoning. You can summon weak creatures, like skeletons or wolves, or opt for more powerful minions like a fearsome giant. Your choice is basically one tough monster or several weaker ones, but these beasts gain experience as they go, so eventually your puny skeletal warrior may become a skeletal lord and gain new attacks and defenses. The experience track makes you take care of your creatures; they aren't just cannon fodder."", ""<I>The Art of Magic</I> also features a 3-D point of view and fairly good 3-D graphics. The spell effects are fantastic, even if the voice acting isn't so good. The gameplay is very involved but can at times bog you down with minutia, especially concerning the sheer amount of spells, items, and creatures.

Grim Fandango,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC']",{},"['a dark comedy neo-noir Windows adventure game released by LucasArts in 1998, primarily written by Tim Schafer. It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use 3D computer graphics overlaid on pre-rendered, static backgrounds. As with other LucasArts adventure games, the player must converse with other characters and examine, collect, and use objects correctly to solve puzzles in order to progress.\n\nGrim Fandango\'s world combines elements of the Aztec belief of afterlife with style aspects of film noir, including The Maltese Falcon, On the Waterfront and Casablanca, to create the Land of the Dead, through which recently departed souls, represented in the game as calaca-like figures, must travel before they reach their final destination, the Ninth Underworld. The story follows travel agent Manuel ""Manny"" Calavera as he attempts to save Mercedes ""Meche"" Colomar, a newly arrived but virtuous soul, during her long journey.\n\nThe game received positive reviews, praising its artistic design and overall game direction in particular. Grim Fandango was selected for several gaming awards at the time of release, and is often listed in publishers\' lists of top games of all time.

Star Wars: Rogue Squadron 3D (LucasArts Archive Series),,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Ever wonder what Luke Skywalker was doing after he blew up the Death Star, or how the Rebels came to establish their base on Hoth? The answers are in <i>Star Wars--Rogue Squadron 3D.</i> Players become Luke in this shooter game, leading missions for a Rebellion still scrambling to recover from the loss of its base at the end of the original <i>Star Wars</i> film. Luke and Wedge Antilles, the sole survivors of the Death Star battle, have formed an elite squadron of pilots to fly from one end of the galaxy to another, fighting Imperial ships from TIE fighters to the fearsome AT-ATs of <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>.<P> With clear mission goals and easy-to-fly spacecraft at your command, <i>Star Wars--Rogue Squadron 3D</i> offers hours of player entertainment. It has an arcade-style sensibility, scoring your success in each level with a gold, silver, or bronze medal. Enough medals translate into promotions and access to better technology. The action takes place over planets established in <i>Star Wars</i> film and comic book tie-ins; this, when combined with the familiar <i>Star Wars</i> music and sounds, renders pleasing--almost homey--familiarity. The worlds and ships are drawn in meticulous detail, right down to effects like dust plumes that rise from the deserts of Tatooine when you're about to crash into the sand.<P> Unfortunately, the game allows single-player action only, with no multiplayer options on either a local network or Internet. Some players may find this disappointing. But for fans of the movies or anyone looking for high-flying solo fun, <i>Star Wars--Rogue Squadron 3D</i> may be exactly what you seek. <i>--Alyx Dellamonica</i>"", ""The Rebel Alliance at last has a glimmer of hope. They have just destroyed the Death Star and found new allies in Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. Things might finally be looking up for the freedom fighters of Star Wars, but there is no time to rest on the accomplishments of the past. The Empire remains a powerful adversary that could easily crush the Alliance if it chose to bring its full might to bear. The ragtag fleet that is the Rebellion must still try to establish itself and build a power base sufficient to challenge the Emperor. And to do that, it will need to rely on the skills of the legendary Rogue Squadron. <P>Rogue Squadron is a good game, albeit a simple one. This isn't X-Wing or TIE Fighter; it's an arcade action game, with floating power-ups, extra lives, and densely populated worlds that exist purely for your shooting enjoyment. Rogue Squadron owes its existence to last year's Shadows of the Empire, an N64 and PC game that was basically a medley of different arcade games. The most popular levels were the Hoth levels, which were basically arcade flight combat over the snowy hills of Hoth. You piloted a snowspeeder, battling Imperial probe droids, AT-ST walkers, and AT-ATs. Rogue Squadron plays like those early Hoth levels from Shadows of the Empire but on a much larger scale. Instead of one craft - the snowspeeder - you can now pilot five, plus a few bonus ships. Instead of the one environment - Hoth - you now visit dozens, from the deserts of Tatooine to the watery world of Mon Calamari. Throughout it all, you pilot one lone craft, with two wingmen at your side, battling a horde of Imperial aircraft and ground troops, fulfilling objectives that will harm the Empire and benefit the fledgling Rebel Alliance. <P>Rogue Squadron takes place six months after the destruction of the Death Star in Star Wars. Before Luke became a Jedi, he continued to hone his natural piloting skills, and with the help of Wedge Antilles, formed the elite Rebel starfighter group Rogue Squadron. As the aces of the Alliance, Luke and cohorts must engage in a variety of military operations, and that includes everything from escort missions to search and destroy to rescue missions. <P>There are 16 regular levels to the game, divided into four chapters, as well as a few bonus stages. The levels vary in size, from large to huge. The Hoth level in Shadows of the Empire was fairly small, and these levels are at least four to six times bigger, with many more world objects as well. Hoth was a flat and barren world, but the Tatooine level, for instance, is populated by homesteads, a herd of Bantha, and the port of Mos Eisley. The Kile II military installation is covered with various gun emplacements, barracks, garrisons, and construction yards. The clouds of Taloraan are filled with floating buildings and a giant cloud city, a la Bespin. The different environments you'll encounter in Rogue Squadron include desert, snow, jungle, mountain, urban, lake, snow, volcanic underground, swirling atmospheric clouds, and ocean. Some of the planets encompassed by these environments are Tatooine, Kile II, Kessel, Barkesh, Fest, Taloraan, Mon Calamari, Corellia, and Sullust, These planets have all been cataloged in the various Star Wars comics and novels and should be familiar to many Star Wars fans. <P>Mission objectives in each of the levels are fairly simple. In Tatooine, you have to destroy all Imperial probe droids and keep casualties to a minimum. In the next mission, on Barkesh, you have to escort a Rebel convoy to a shuttle landing area, battling attacks from Imperial walkers and TIE bombers. Missions never get too complex, although later missions have more-involved mission goals. In the Prisons of Kessel, for example, you have to escort General Madine's shuttle to the main prison complex, disable the shield generators, and then protect his shuttle as he makes his rounds at the other prison facilities, all while battling a swarm of probe droids, TIE interceptors and fighters, AT-ATs, walkers, storm troopers, and speeder bikes. Some missions tend to get tedious, especially when you can't find your next mission objective or are just flying around looking for things to kill, but for the most part, missions move along fairly well. I do wish the radar pointer to your objective was a simple arrow, rather than a cone, but that's a minor grievance. <P>The game's graphics are outstanding, with beautiful gameworlds and detailed ships and vehicles. The special effects and lighting are impressive. Dust clouds plume from below your ship when you fly too close to the ground, water splashes up when you fire your lasers into lakes, damaged droids tumble end over end into the ground and then explode into shards. Some of the worlds are very beautiful, especially the swirling clouds of Taloraan and the ocean surfaces of Mon Calamari. As for performance, even when dozens of troopers, guns, aircraft, and buildings jam a screen, there is no slow down. The AT-ATs always looked like they were just moving in place, but apart from that, the animation on the vehicles was good. The sprite-based troopers and soldiers didn't look too good close up, but when you're zipping by at high speeds and high altitudes, you won't really notice. <P>The sound for Rogue Squadron is not as obviously impressive as the graphics, but it shouldn't be dismissed. The familiar score of Star Wars echoes through the chapter briefings and levels, and the whines of TIE fighter engines and the tell-tale sounds of blaster fire bring these Star Wars worlds to life. I did find the voice-overs a little jarring - the characters didn't sound like Luke or Han, but that's because I've grown up hearing their voices, so anything less than the original is bound to disappoint. <P>Unfortunately, there is no multiplayer support in Rogue Squadron, although you will want to make multiple passes at this game thanks to the secret craft and levels. Rogue Squadron's reward system makes it worthwhile to replay missions, which you can do at any time. Basically, you can finish a mission at four levels. You can complete a level with no medal or finish it with a bronze, silver, or gold medal. A mission debriefing shows you your completion time, kills, saves, accuracy, and any bonuses collected. You can beat the game without any medals, but you won't advance in rank. More importantly, winning those medals will open up the game's secrets. <P>Playing Rogue Squadron is a snap, because the action is straightforward and fun. There is always something to kill and clear mission objectives for you to follow. Don't go into this expecting a revolutionary space sim on the level of Descent: Freespace or TIE Fighter. There is a reason why GameSpot puts this game in the action genre - it's an arcade game. This isn't Wing Commander or Independence War, but if you enjoy a good shooter, you should give Rogue Squadron a try. The Alliance could always use a few good pilots. -- Elliott Chin <P><I>--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

LucasArts Archive Series: Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['If adventure has a name, it must be Indiana Jones. The year is 1947. Indy is back (this time in electrifying 3-D!) as a CIA recruit tasked with uncovering why Soviet agents are sniffing around the ruins of the fabled Tower of Babel. So hold onto your fedora and grab your whip in this heart-pounding action quest for the elusive ""Infernal Machine.""', ""It's not often that a game perfectly captures the essence of both genres without compromise. In the case of Infernal Machine, adventure fans will be left wanting, as the latest Indy game is almost 100 percent pure Tomb Raider-style action. It's true that the game has an interesting story, that it creates several memorable gameplay sequences, and that it successfully captures the spirit of Indiana Jones. But quirky controls, repetitive puzzles, and a range of other annoying flaws keep it from being the major-league hit that Indiana Jones fans hoped it would be. <P>The game takes place in 1947, when World War II has ended and the Nazis are finished. But as the Cold War begins, so does a new challenge for the esteemed archaeologist. It seems the Soviets have uncovered a mystery in a dig site near the ancient city of Babylon. Recruited by his old friend Sophia Hapgood, Indy sets off to discover the secret of these ruins before Volodnikov - his portly Soviet rival - gets his hands on whatever it is. And so Indy will embark on an adventure that leads him to Kazakstan, the Philippines, Mexico, and the Sudan. The game features 16 levels in all, including one secret level. <P>Gameplay in Infernal Machine is similar to that of the Tomb Raider games, though Infernal Machine also bears a strong resemblance to Bethesda's action-adventure Redguard. Between levels, Indy can use the treasures he has found to purchase additional equipment and healing supplies, which is a good idea and a welcome one for this type of game. <P>However, excluding that small innovation, Infernal Machine is mostly about jumping, climbing, and swinging from Indy's whip. In fact, the game often puts too much emphasis on this sort of thing. Nearly every puzzle of consequence requires extensive jumping or climbing. It's as if the developers forgot that puzzles can be simpler and less agility-driven and still remain a challenge. Yet after the first four or five levels of Infernal Machine, most of the puzzles become quite repetitive - even predictable - and you may find yourself longing for a straightforward combination puzzle or other thinking challenge rather than another sequence of blocks and ladders. <P>Even if you never tire of the sort of puzzle that requires numerous jumps and shimmies, you probably won't appreciate the controls you'll have to work to overcome. Keyboard users should just forget about it right now: The game is simply too jerky and unresponsive on the keyboard. A gamepad is the best way to control Indy's moves, but even with a good pad you'll still run into some problems. To begin with, there's often too much of a delay between actions. There is a pause as you climb onto a ledge or ladder, or up out of water. This slows down your progress significantly and can be deadly in certain areas, particularly in one adrenaline-pumping sequence involving a gargantuan ice creature. A game that relies so heavily on quick-reflex challenges needs to react faster and better to user input. <P>One other major problem with the controls is that the game is far too picky about the way you line up next to a button, door, or other interactive object. Far too often, you have to line up just right or else nothing will happen. This is especially irksome during some of the game's key puzzles, where you might think you've already tried a particular solution but actually haven't because you weren't in quite the right place when you hit the action button. As a result, you'll end up trying a hundred other possibilities before stumbling back onto the proper solution. <P>However, Infernal Machine isn't all bad. The graphics, while not exactly cutting edge, are generally quite good. Save for his enormous head, the in-game Indiana Jones actually resembles Harrison Ford, and many of his mannerisms are captured well by the animations. The fact that he always pulls out a fresh hat from somewhere after climbing out of the water is a nice touch. Unfortunately, many of the other 3D models are not so good, but even their movements are fairly smooth and convincing. <P>Most of the levels are aesthetically well designed because of convincing architecture and wall decorations that seem appropriate to each locale. Spiderwebs and other atmospheric touches are well placed. Many of the outdoor levels have a blocky, artificial look, but the indoor scenery is impressive. <P>The game features just enough enemies without seeming excessive. Why you cannot shoot an attacking wolf is peculiar (you can only frighten it off), but the rest of the creatures and enemies will make for impressive encounters. Not only will you meet a horde of Soviet troops on your journey, but also plenty of spiders, scorpions, lizards, and snakes. There are also a few memorable boss monsters to fight. <P>However, in terms of providing high-quality gameplay, the level design in Infernal Machine is not quite what it should be. Most of the game's puzzles require a great deal of back-and-forth travel across each level. This wouldn't be so bad if it didn't require numerous trips through areas filled with extensive and tedious climbing and jumping. It also wouldn't be so bad if the game didn't rely so heavily on frustratingly obscure puzzles that seem to be designed to make players retrace their steps several times. Among other things, returning to the beach on Palawan Lagoon and the seemingly never-ending plant puzzle in the Shambala Temple come across as backward, convoluted, or both. Many of the puzzles in Infernal Machine simply have too many steps. Rarely, if ever, are you presented with an obvious challenge that you just have to logically think your way through. Fans of the Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis adventure game will likely be disappointed by this structure - not to mention the action-oriented gameplay - while even Tomb Raider veterans may find many of the puzzle solutions disjointed, random, and too long. <P>Even so, the game can be great at times. Some of the extended action sequences, such as the inflatable raft, mining car, and jeep scenes, are a lot of fun. The sound effects, though somewhat tinny, add a lot of atmosphere to the game. Indy's comments are well timed and helpful, while some of the other dialogue can be very funny. In fact, if not for the quirky controls, this would be a good 3D action game - albeit one with some ill-conceived puzzles and obstacles. <P>In final analysis, Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine is a decent 3D action game that suffers from control problems and puzzles that quickly grow old and repetitive. Tomb Raider fans may enjoy the look and feel of the game, and die-hard Indy fans should get a kick out of the archaeologist's first 3D game, but anyone expecting a pure combination of action and adventure will likely be disappointed. -- <i>Michael E.
