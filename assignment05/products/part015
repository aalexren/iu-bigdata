His hopes of saving his sister vanished with his freedom. Just as despair threatens to overcome him, hope comes from where he would have least expected. The Orcs, a race the Hero had always hated, have put together a rescue squad that frees him from his bonds. He emerges into a land desecrated by evil. He embarks on a journey to shed light on Gandohar\'s dark past, hoping to discover a weak point in his enemy\'s defense. If he fails, he will lose his sister forever. <p/> <table align=right width=250 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td valign=""top"" height=""189""> <div align=""center""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/2.worlds.2.01.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""Dual wielding swords against multiple skeleton enemies in Two Worlds II"" title=""Dual wielding swords against multiple skeleton enemies in Two Worlds II"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/2.worlds.2.01.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""300"" height=""169""></a><br> </div> <center> <span class=""caption"">A new and improved flexible attack system.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/2.worlds.2.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign=""top"" height=""199""> <div align=""center""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/2.worlds.2.02.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=520\'); return false;""><img alt=""A beautifully rendered moonlit scene from Two Worlds II"" title=""A beautifully rendered moonlit scene from Two Worlds II"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/2.worlds.2.02.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""300"" height=""188""></a><br> </div> <center> <span class=""caption"">State of the art graphics with the Grace Engine.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/2.worlds.2.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=520\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Two Worlds II</i> is a perfect blend of classic and innovated RPG features, atmosphere, and technology.

Although he has shown great promise, Hiro is the last ninja that anyone would expect to save the world, yet that is exactly what he is called to do when an evil samurai warlord hatches a plan bent on total world domination. In this plan the evil lord attempts to recapture the dominion he held prior to previously being cast out by creating an army of samurai slaves out of innocent animals. In the process of doing this he also upsets the natural balance of the the world, causing catastrophic storms. This the mini ninjas can not stand for. Armed with authentic ninja weapons and powerful spells, Hiro must rescue the fellow ninjas of his clan who the warlord has captured and then lead them on an exciting journey to battle the magical army of twisted Samurai. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> In <i>Mini Ninjas</i> players have their choice of six playable ninja characters, although as the game begins you will be limited to the main character, Hiro, and his comrade, the slow, but strong un-ninja like Futo. As part of the revealing of the storyline, players are tasked with searching out Hiro\'s fellow ninjas, who at the beginning of the game were sent out to investigate troubles in the land, but never returned. They were captured by the evil warlord. As Hiro and Futo set each of these free, they in turn become playable characters. Each of the six playable characters has unique abilities, and utilizes a variety of ninja-specific weapons, items and moves, as well as ""Kuji Magic,"" which each--especially Hiro--can use to help them against enemies. These uses include classic mana-like blasts, but also more surprising and powerful forms such as the ability to take animal form in time of need. <p/> <b>A New Kind of Ninja</b><br/> <i>Mini Ninjas</i> is an action adventure game with a fresh take on the ninja fascination that has long been part of video games culture. Designed to be kid-friendly, although the game utilzes realistic ninja weapons and moves, there is no actual killing. Because the evil ninjas and other enemies that players face are actually animals captured by the evil warlord, when they are defeated they revert back to their original animal forms, correcting the imbalance that the plans of the samurai warlord have caused, and ensuring game suitability for all ages of players. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>6 playable Mini Ninjas, each with his own unique strengths and abilities.</li> <li>Authentic ninja weapons and moves.</li> <li>Kuji magic spells that help you control animals, enemies and the powers of nature.</li> <li>Versatile ninja hats that can be used as vehicles and shields.</li> <li>Huge boss battles.</li> <li>No killing &ndash; when an enemy is defeated, it&rsquo;s transformed into its original animal form.</li> <li>Beautiful, distinctive and original art-stylization.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

The leg strap is used in a wide variety of EA Sports Active cardio based exercises, including jogging, tennis, cardio boxing and many more. The resistance band is used in just as many exercises where adding extra tension on arms and legs is beneficial. These two accessories, along with your copy of <i>EA Sports Active</i> and Wii Remote/nunchuck controller (each sold separately), are all you need to turn the single player exercise routines of <i>EA Sports Active</i> into the fun, fat-burning multiplayer experience you have been looking for. <p/> <b><i>EA Sports Active</i> Gameplay</b><br/> Designed around the standard Wii Remote/Nunchuck tethered controller configuration, <i>EA Sports Active</i>\'s interactive fitness program is more focused on physical activities than previous \'fitness\' titles for the Wii, but still challenges you to have fun while developing a more healthy lifestyle. Separated into the three sections of workout, nutrition, lifestyle, and other activity, the user\'s experience begins with a pep talk from Bob Greene which quickly transitions into the beginnings of action as players set up profiles, choose a virtual personal trainer and enter baseline data like age, weight, gender, fitness goals, etc. Although the nutrition, lifestyle, and other activity sections add a holistic element facilitated by a mix of surveys and data input, building fitness through physical activity is the driving force behind <i>EA Sports Active</i> and as such the meat of the content resides in the workout section. Here players will find dozens of themed strength training and cardio workouts which can be customized as you choose and linked into circuit training routines. These routines are introduced and monitored by your personal trainer, and allow for ongoing player motivation via real-time feedback on your workout form, an approximation of calories burned and the ability to adjust levels of exercise intensity. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b><i>EA Sports Active</i> Accessory Pack</b>.</li> <ul> <li><u>Leg Strap</u> - Used in conjunction with a Wii Remote controller configuration, your movements tracked on-screen with this adjustable, specially-designed leg strap. </li> <li><u>Resistance Band</u> - Increase the intensity of bicep curls, shoulder presses and many other exercises.</li> </ul> <li><b><i>EA Sports Active</i></b> (not included with accessory pack).</li> <ul> <li><u>Active Fitness Made Fun &amp; Easy</u> - 20 minute circuits feature a variety of familiar activities that target upper body, lower body as well as cardio.

Like a few other releases in its franchise it does not contain a storyline, instead focusing on the tried and true 3-on-3, five round team fighting gameplay mechanic. Far from a liability, the lack of storyline plays into the fighting mechanic by eliminating official teams linked to the prevailing story, which in earlier releases compromised the characters that could be added to a team. In addition, the game also features new combat elements including the ""Critical Counter"" system which opens up the possibility of additional linked attacks and finishing moves when players land effective counter punches following an opponent\'s attack, and ""Clash Timing,"" a break effect during a bout that separates combatants when they land blows on each other at the exact same time. <p/> <b>More Than 20 Playable Characters</b><br/> Although the more than 20 characters featured in <i>The King of Fighters XII</i> is only about half the numbers veteran players of the series may have grown used to selecting from in earlier releases, the characters that are included having each been recreated for the game are very much graphically superior to anything ever seen in franchise history. Going for an old school feel, the majority of these are pulled from early <i>King of Fighters</i> games. They also retain, as close as possible, their original move set and have been rendered in costumes either from their classic <i>King of Fighters</i> appearances, or in some cases that of their original game.

The ultranationalist Russian leader Zakhaev has been eliminated, but it seems that his lieutenant, Vladimir Makarov, is an even bigger danger. Having made a successful play for power, Intel indicates that he is extending the reach of his influence well beyond the borders of Mother Russia, causing a stir in the international community and prompting the involvement of Task Force 141. Task Force 141 is an elite multinational unit made up of Navy Seals, Delta Force operatives, British SAS and CIA. In the single player campaign you are Sergeant Gary ""Roach"" Sanderson, with the hero of <i>Call of Duty 4</i>, ""Soap"" MacTavish, promoted to Captain, making an appearance as an NPC (non-player character) and your commanding officer. The elimination of Makarov and his underlings at any cost is your number one priority, regardless where the fight occurs. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> The latest release in arguably the most successful tactical first-person shooter franchise of all-time, gameplay in <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> follows the same winning and time-tested structure of earlier games in the series. In the single player campaign players are aided by AI squad members as they take on a series of missions aimed at eliminating Ultranationalist forces. Each mission is built around a particular objective, with players utilizing some level of guidance from NPC characters, including ""Soap"" MacTavish, and aided in navigation by the game\'s heads up display (HUD). Along the way players will be able to utilize a wide variety of weaponry and and vehicles, as well as be able to customize weapons with gadgets attached to them. <p/> Also, just as in previous games in the series, <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> is heavily focused on multiplayer gameplay. The different multiplayer modes, available both in local play and online, contain plenty of customization options and revolve around different strategies ranging from the every man for himself action of ""Free-for All,"" the classic team-based fun of ""Capture the Flag and the tactical, team-oriented action of ""Search and Destroy,"" just to name a few. Multiplayer modes also feature the ""Perk"" System that players may be familiar with from earlier in the franchise. Through this system players gain additional abilities, weapons and benefits as they gain experience in combat. This can be done by leveling up, but another important way way is through ""kill streaks,"" the number of enemies eliminated in succession. These are available beginning with three kills and include the ability to call for supply drops, predator missile strikes, helicopter gunships and many more. Players have the ability to customize in advance which perks will be available at each number and can even gauge their progress towards each at the touch of a button. With an eye towards not making the game too hard for new players the game also features help to players experiencing ""death streaks,"" multiple consecutive deaths in multiplayer matches. <p/> <b>Special Ops Co-op Mode</b><br/> Along with a single player mode and multiple multiplayer modes, <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> also features an unique third main play option, Special Ops Mode. Available both online and in local play, Special Ops Mode is designed to provide a distinct time-based play option, featuring special scenarios not found in other modes in the game and lots of enemies to take on. This mode can be played either alone or with a friend, again either locally or online, with local co-op play including split-screen functionality. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Challenging Multiplayer Modes</b> &ndash; <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> will contain a wealth of multiplayer modes including: the every man for himself action of ""Free-for All,"" the classic team-based fun of ""Capture the Flag and the tactical, team-oriented action of ""Search and Destroy.""</li> <li><b>Improved AI Enemies</b> &ndash; Improved artificial intelligence now allows enemies to attack from virtually any direction as players respawn into the game adding additional challenges.</li> <li><b>An All-new <i>Call of Duty</i> Adventure</b> - <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> features an all new <i>Call of Duty</i> storyline revolving around the continuing struggles against the Russian rebel group the Ultranationalists, who have found a new and more dangerous leader.</li> <li><b>The \'Special Ops\' Optional Co-op Mode</b> &ndash; ""Special Ops"" Mode allows two players, either alone or with a friend, to engage in unique mission play and features split-screen functionality.</li> <li><b>Diverse In-game Environments</b> - Battlegrounds traversed in the game range from the lonely, snow-clad mountains of Kazakhstan, to dark tunnels in the Afghanistan and the crowded slums of Rio.</li> <li><b>Nonstop Action</b> - <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> contains no cutscenes, so players are always engaged in the action, no matter where they are in the game.</li> <li><b>New Breach Gameplay Mechanic</b> - Players can now blaze their own paths through the game by ""Breaching"" formerly impregnable obstacles like walls and doors with explosives.</li> <li><b>New Gadgets, Weapons and Weapons System</b> <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> contains many new and updated weapons, new weapons attachments, as well as a variant of the multiplayer weapons customization system from <i>Call of Duty 4</i>, now available in the single player campaign.</li> <li><b>New Perks and Increased Customization</b> - Multiplayer modes feature new perks for leveling up, and for killstreaks and deathstreaks.

Welcome to the 1980s&hellip;Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his reappearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He\'s set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself. But all work and no play does indeed make Tommy a dull boy. Thankfully, for the action man, or outdoors type, there\'s tons of fun things to do and adventures to be had in the aptly named Vice City... guaranteed. And for the secretive or creepy type, it is a place full of surprises, a place where you\'ll constantly be surprised by the vivacious, fun-loving types who live there and the things you can discover. <p/> Originally released for PlayStation 2 in 2002 and ported over to the PC a year later, <i>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</i> is chock full of 1980s American culture references, as well as a continuation of the sandbox style action adventure gameplay that is the hallmark of the <i>GTA</i> series. It is also one of the top selling games of all-time on the PS2 platform. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li>An expanded control scheme allows for play in mouse-look 3rd person view or the classic <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> console view.

Add to Tommy\'s 80\'s culture wardrobe or create a whole new original spin on the character itself.</li> <li>EAX 3.0 enhanced audio immerses you in the sounds of the city and a new MP3 radio station lets you broadcast your own music over Vice City\'s airwaves.</li> <li>At any given time players can watch a replay of the last 30 seconds of the game and mail your unbelievable gameplay sequences to friends to watch.</li> </ul> <table width=""160"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" align=""left"" cellspacing=""0""> <tr> <td><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/gta.sa.logo.150.jpg"" align=""center"" alt=""\'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\' game logo"" title=""\'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\' game logo"" width=""150"" height=""139""><br/> <small><center><b><i></i></b></center></small></td></tr></table> Five years ago Carl Johnson escaped from the pressures of life in Los Santos, San Andreas... a city tearing itself apart with gang trouble, drugs and corruption.

To combat these menaces they have, and must continue to harness the power of the mysterious creatures known as Spectrobes. <p/> <b>What is a Spectrobe?</b><br/> Spectrobes are ancient beings of light that have existed since the beginnings of the galaxy. In fact, they are so ancient that most, although alive, now exist suspended in a fossilized state. Aside from the fact that Spectrobes are large and imposing, the essence of their power resides in their orientation to one of five elemental properties: fire, plant, earth, sky or water. These properties are not all created equal though, instead having particular exploitable strengths when pitted against other forces; for example, fire is strong against plant, water is strong when used against fire, plant is strong against earth, sky is strong against water, etc. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Gameplay in <i>Spectrobes: Origins</i> centers around the player\'s ability to successfully utilize and fight along side their stable of collected Spectrobes in battle against a variety of enemies. Unlike earlier <i>Spectrobes</i> games, <i>Spectrobes: Origins</i> is designed around real-time battles. Both the player\'s character and their current Spectrobe simultaneously engage enemies in combat utilizing standard attacks, as well as combos to gain experience points. The game features more than a hundred different Spectrobes and players are able to carry several at any one time, as well as various character armaments. Each Spectrobe has its own set of distinct attributes, which underlines the importance of developing a strategy for their use in advance, depending on what challenges and different opponents you think you might face. But before a player can plan for this he/she must build a collection of Spectrobes. This is done, as was in previous games by excavating the fossilized creatures. In <i>Origins</i> though this is taken to a whole different level via the Wii\'s motion sensing capabilities and a time based mini-game. Once players have identified an area containing a Spectrobe they will utilize the Wii remote and nunchuck configuration to put a wide range of tools to work in removing it from the ground. These tools include everything from bombs to hammers, lasers and blowdryers. The game features 3D imaging, so during this process players will see their Spectrobes realistically emerge bit by bit from the the raw earth, and after full excavation will nurture them up close as they heal from any injuries that may have suffered during the digging and take on nourishment in an area called ""the incubator."" Here players can also bond with and get to know the powers of each Spectrobes before they join the fight. <p/> Another difference from earlier releases in the series is the expansion of the Jeena character. Previously occupying more of a support role to Rallen, with specialties in the the fields of communication, research and problem-solving, in this adventure Jeena is a full-fledged playable character, able to team up with Spectrobes against enemies in battle. She also has entirely different personality traits and sensibilities than Rallen, ensuring diverse gameplay and an even male/female balance characterwise. Both Rallen and Jeena are available in the games\' co-op mode which allows an additional player to join the fight in the role of the selected Spectrobe. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>For the first time in <i>Spectrobes</i> franchise history battle as either Rallen or Jeena and master each hero\'s skills.</li> <li>Awaken, train and command over 100 different types of Spectrobes.</li> <li>Innovative design with never seen before 3D Spectrobe excavation system.</li> <li>Locate and unearth hidden items with the help of your Spectrobes.</li> <li>Hone the skills of your adult and evolved form Spectrobes and battle enemies in real-time combat.</li> <li>Play both in single player mode as Rallen or Jeena, or in co-op mode where a friend joins you playing as the Spectrobe of choice.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

After discovering that Clank\'s disappearance was engineered by Dr. Nefarious, Ratchet races to rescue his best friend. Unfortunately, he discovers that Clank\'s capture is just the beginning of Nefarious\'s latest diabolical plot. <p/> In this follow-up to the best-selling series, <i>Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: A Crack in Time</i> puts players into the role of both Ratchet and Clank as they attempt to reunite and save the universe. Along the way, both will finally uncover the hidden truth behind their origins, and discover their ultimate destinies. As the duo come closer to reuniting, they\'ll have to ask themselves the biggest question of all: Do Ratchet and Clank\'s destinies lie with each other? Or is it finally time for the universe\'s greatest duo to separate for good? <p/> <b>Gameplay: New Time-related Abilities and More</b><br/> As with previous <i>Ratchet &amp; Clank</i> games the action in <i>A Crack in Time</i> is a blend of platforming, shooter scenarios and puzzle-solving. Seeing as the premise of the game is that the constantly impending rescue of Clank by Ratchet, action naturally toggles between the scenarios that both find themselves in separately. Playing as Ratchet players engage primarily in a mix of exploration and comic shooter style gameplay that occurs both on planetoids and on space ships throughout the gameplay area. As players come in contact with non-player characters (NPCs) they will often be asked to perform duties such as rescues, for which they will be given rewards that Ratchet can then use to purchase new weapons and items. Many of these weapons are brand-new to the <i>Ratchet &amp; Clank</i> franchise and can be upgraded and moded throughout the game for maximum impact against the run-of-the-mill enemies that cross your path, and of course the inevitable bosses faced. <p/> The lion\'s share new play elements in <i>A Crack in Time</i> are seen in its Clank gameplay though. A blend of self replication and time manipulation, Clank\'s new abilities are revealed in an early level in the game in which players are able to peer into Clank\'s memory. Here they meet Clank\'s maker, Orvis, and see that Clank has access to two hidden abilities/items: limited physical self replication and the Chronoscepter, which helps Clank to both fix broken items and slow down time. With regard to replication, mechanisms called ""Time Pads"" allow players to record Clank as he performs calculated physical movements and actions. These can then be saved individually and later replayed in specific combinations in the presence of the real Clank to solve puzzles requiring extreme speed or that he be in multiple places at the same time. Similar in usage to this is the Chronoscepter which can be used against swift moving objects or enemies while platforming in order to get into positions which otherwise would be impossible to reach. Used separately as well as together these two make for new wrinkles in Clank\'s abilities to solve complex puzzles across 3D spaces and in evasion and combat of enemies. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>An original new adventure and story that answers many of fans&rsquo; most-asked questions and wraps up the story arc that started in <i>Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</i> and <i>Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Quest For Booty</i>.</li> <li>Nonlinear levels with plenty of hidden areas to explore, and new gadgets like the Hoverboots that let Ratchet soar to new heights.</li> <li>All-new Clank gameplay and special ""Time"" abilities that bring new meaning to ""past selves"".</li> <li>The series&rsquo; renowned arsenal gets even larger with brand new weapons, as well as weapons that players can customize with various modifications.</li> <li>New space gameplay that gives players the opportunity to engage in space battles, explore the surrounding star system, and discover hidden items and collectibles.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

One group of these kids, who name themselves the ""Bakugan Battle Brawlers"" and who are led by Dan, find that the cards also serve as a link to a parallel dimension known as Vestroia.

The game is something of a cross between marbles and a live action card game. To get started you\'ll first need to enter your name, select an attribute and create your character. Then you\'ll be ready to explore the world of <i>Bakugan</i>. If you can\'t wait to start battling your friends, then head straight to the Battle Arena, but if you want to be the best you have to learn the rules. The goal of <i>Bakugan: Battle Brawlers</i> is to win the game by collecting three ""gate cards."" Gate cards are collected by winning battles against opponents. As a starting move each player sets down one metallic gate card. Then you\'re ready to roll your Bakugan, which is in the form of a ball. After throwing you can steer your Bakugan around the environment so that it lands on the perfect card and collects powerups. The aim is to get your Bakugan to stand on a card, and that happens when they roll over it slowly. Once the Bakugan stands, it will transform into Battle Mode. Now you\'re ready to battle. A battle begins when two Bakugan from different players stand on the same gate card. The gate card then opens and both bakugan transform into Monster Mode, and are ready to fight. The gate card can add ""G-Power"" to a Bakugan according to its world attribute (color) and can also change the rules of the battle. Players can also boost their G-power by doing well in battle. The Bakugan with the highest G-power at the end of the battle wins. <p/> After battling, you can also use the points you have won to upgrade your Bakugan, acquire new in-game items, engage in Tag Team or Battle Royale action, or hone your skills by practicing your moves and strategy with Dan. </td> </tr> </table> <br/> <b>Additional Screenshots</b>:<br/> <table cellspacing=""0"" align=""center""> <tr> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;""><img alt=""Marbles/card hybrid gameplay in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" title=""Marbles/card hybrid gameplay in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.01.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Hybrid gameplay.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;""><img alt=""Collect all the Bakugan in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" title=""Collect all the Bakugan in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.02.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Collectable Bakugan.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;""><img alt=""Multiplayer action in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" title=""Multiplayer action in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.03.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Multiplayer action.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;""><img alt=""Defend Vestroia and the Earth in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" title=""Defend Vestroia and the Earth in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.04.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Defend the Earth.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

The first of these are Focus Attacks. These moves allow players to absorb the energy from an attack and quickly counter with their own. Used properly, Focus Attacks allow for tremendous flexibility during combat and are the end result of efforts by the game\'s development team to evolve combat away from the rigid memorization of set combination patterns, giving players the freedom to be creative against opponents. The other new combat feature are new powered up moves called Ultra Combos. Like standard combos their purpose is to unleash maximum damage on an opponent, but unlike the combos of old, when performed correctly these long strings of punches, kicks and moves result in changes to the in-game camera angle and quick cinematics which illustrate the strength of your skills like never before. Taken together, these two new features herald <i>Street Fighter IV</i> as the new king of the fighter genre and a force to be reckoned with for years to come. <p/> <h4>System Requirements:</h4><center><table border=1 cellpadding=""3""><tr> <td width=""11%""></td> <td align=center> <b>Minimum Specifications:</b></td><td align=center> <b>Recommended Specifications:</b></td><tr> <td width=""11%"">OS:</td> <td align=center width=""44%"">Windows XP SP3 / Vista SP1</td> <td align=center width=""44%"">Windows XP SP3 / Vista SP1</td> </tr><tr valign=""top""> <td width=""11%"">Processor:</td> <td align=center width=""44%"">Intel Pentium4 2.0GHz or higher</td><td align=center width=""44%"">Intel Core2Duo 2.0GHz or higher</td> </tr><tr> <td width=""11%"">RAM:</td> <td align=center width=""44%"">1GB RAM or more</td><td align=center width=""44%"">2GB RAM or more</td> </tr><tr> <td width=""11%"">Disc Drive:</td> <td align=center width=""44%"">8x DVD ROM or faster</td><td align=center width=""44%"">8x DVD ROM or faster</td> </tr><tr valign=""top""> <td width=""11%"">Hard Drive:</td> <td align=center width=""44%"">10GB hard disk space or more</td><td align=center width=""44%"">10GB hard disk space or more</td> </tr><tr valign=""top""> <td width=""11%"">Video Card:</td> <td align=center>DirectX 9.0c/Shader3.0 or higher compatible, NVIDIA GeForce6600 series, ATI Radeon(TM) X1600 or higher or higher, VRAM :256MB or higher Sound: DirectSound compatible, DirectX 9.0c (or higher) compatible</td> <td align=center>DirectX 9.0c/Shader3.0 or higher compatible, NVIDIA GeForce8600 series or higher, ATI Radeon(TM) X 1900 or higher, VRAM :512MB or higher Sound: DirectSound compatible, DirectX 9.0c (or higher) compatible</td> </tr><tr valign=""top""> <td width=""11%"">Input device:</td> <td align=center>Keyboard, mouse and/or gamepad</td><td align=center>Keyboard, mouse and/or gamepad</td></tr><tr valign=""top""> <td width=""11%"">Other:</td> <td colspan=""2"" align=center>Internet connection required for online play</td></tr></table></center> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

One group of these kids, who name themselves the ""Bakugan Battle Brawlers"" and who are led by Dan, find that the cards also serve as a link to a parallel dimension known as Vestroia.

The game is something of a cross between marbles and a live action card game. To get started you\'ll first need to enter your name, select an attribute and create your character. Then you\'ll be ready to explore the world of <i>Bakugan</i>. If you can\'t wait to start battling your friends, then head straight to the Battle Arena, but if you want to be the best you have to learn the rules. The goal of <i>Bakugan: Battle Brawlers</i> is to win the game by collecting three ""gate cards."" Gate cards are collected by winning battles against opponents. As a starting move each player sets down one metallic gate card. Then you\'re ready to roll your Bakugan, which is in the form of a ball. After throwing you can steer your Bakugan around the environment so that it lands on the perfect card and collects powerups. The aim is to get your Bakugan to stand on a card, and that happens when they roll over it slowly. Once the Bakugan stands, it will transform into Battle Mode. Now you\'re ready to battle. A battle begins when two Bakugan from different players stand on the same gate card. The gate card then opens and both bakugan transform into Monster Mode, and are ready to fight. The gate card can add ""G-Power"" to a Bakugan according to its world attribute (color) and can also change the rules of the battle. Players can also boost their G-power by doing well in battle.

One group of these kids, who name themselves the ""Bakugan Battle Brawlers"" and who are led by Dan, find that the cards also serve as a link to a parallel dimension known as Vestroia. Here they discover that the game and its monsters that they are dedicated to mastering is tied to an imbalance of positive and negative energy in Vestroia.

The game is something of a cross between marbles and a live action card game. To get started you\'ll first need to enter your name, select an attribute and create your character. Then you\'ll be ready to explore the world of <i>Bakugan</i>. If you can\'t wait to start battling your friends, then head straight to the Battle Arena, but if you want to be the best you have to learn the rules. The goal of <i>Bakugan: Battle Brawlers</i> is to win the game by collecting three ""gate cards."" Gate cards are collected by winning battles against opponents. As a starting move each player sets down one metallic gate card. Then you\'re ready to roll your Bakugan, which is in the form of a ball. After throwing you can steer your Bakugan around the environment so that it lands on the perfect card and collects powerups. The aim is to get your Bakugan to stand on a card, and that happens when they roll over it slowly. Once the Bakugan stands, it will transform into Battle Mode. Now you\'re ready to battle. A battle begins when two Bakugan from different players stand on the same gate card. The gate card then opens and both bakugan transform into Monster Mode, and are ready to fight. The gate card can add ""G-Power"" to a Bakugan according to its world attribute (color) and can also change the rules of the battle. Players can also boost their G-power by doing well in battle. The Bakugan with the highest G-power at the end of the battle wins. <p/> After battling, you can also use the points you have won to upgrade your Bakugan, acquire new in-game items, engage in Tag Team or Battle Royale action, or hone your skills by practicing your moves and strategy with Dan. </td> </tr> </table> <br/> <b>Additional Screenshots</b>:<br/> <table cellspacing=""0"" align=""center""> <tr> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;""><img alt=""Marbles/card hybrid gameplay in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" title=""Marbles/card hybrid gameplay in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.01.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Hybrid gameplay.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;""><img alt=""Collect all the Bakugan in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" title=""Collect all the Bakugan in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.02.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Collectable Bakugan.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;""><img alt=""Multiplayer action in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" title=""Multiplayer action in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.03.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Multiplayer action.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;""><img alt=""Defend Vestroia and the Earth in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" title=""Defend Vestroia and the Earth in \'Bakugan: Battle Brawlers\'"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.04.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Defend the Earth.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/bakugan.bb.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=660,height=500\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Mix light attacks with heavy attacks to create combos, then incorporate jumps and grabs to add another layer to your combat. With dodging and Holy Cross moves thrown into the mix, you can truly become a force to be reckoned with. Without using all of your combative skills and techniques, there is no hope of ever reaching Beatrice. <p/> <b>Holy Powers</b><br/> During your journey, you may collect magic abilities for use against the legions of hell. When you perform the Righteous Path power you make a dash attack and leave a trail of icy shards in your wake. With Martyrdom you sacrifice health and mana to deal a heavy amount of damage to surrounding enemies. Divine Armor regenerates your health and protects you from damage. Add these and other powers to your arsenal to vanquish all who stand in your way and when you need to replenish your mana-fueled abilities, visit the Holy Fountains scattered throughout the gameplay area. <p/> <b>Creature Taming</b><br/> As powerful as weapons and magic are, sometimes surviving the perils of hell requires brute force.

The Umbrella Corporation and its crop of lethal viruses have been destroyed and contained. But a new, more dangerous threat has emerged. Years after surviving the events in Raccoon City, Chris Redfield has been fighting the scourge of bio-organic weapons all over the world. Now a member of the Bio-terrorism Security Assessment Alliance (B.S.A.A.), Chris is sent to Africa to investigate a biological agent that is transforming the populace into aggressive and disturbing creatures. Joined by another local BSSA agent, Sheva Alomar, the two must work together to solve the truth behind the disturbing turn of events. <p/> <b>Exciting Two-Player Co-op Mode</b><br/> The new cooperative gameplay element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone.

Built around two-player cooperative action, the accessible controls and family-friendly gameplay bring Star Wars fans across generations together like never before to fight the evil Separatists and restore peace to the galaxy. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Gameplay in <i>Star Wars the Clone Wars: Republic Heroes</i> is mission-based. Players can choose to approach the action as either a Jedi or a clone class character. Playing as a Jedi you have access to eight playable characters, and as a clone you play as one of a group of clones. The game was developed with co-op play in mind, which means players can more or less count on never fighting alone, which is a good thing considering the hordes of battle droids and other enemies you will face. The game also features a puzzle-solving gameplay component, as well as an upgrade system based on the collection of ""Force Orbs"" scattered throughout the game environment. <p/> <b>Weapons and Combat</b><br/> Keeping with the games\' user friendly approach, the control scheme has been designed with Jedi character\'s lightsaber and force powers, as well as clone characters firing trigger accessible from a single input source. Because of the difference in the character classes weapons, combat differs depending on the class chosen. Due to their reliance on the their lightsabers, Jedi will mostly engage enemies at close range, although force power attacks can allow for more distance from targets. In addition, utilizing Jedi powers at point blank range players are able to engage in ""droidjacking,"" which allows a Jedi to take control of a droid\'s weapons system and other abilities. On the other hand, clone character combat relies more on firepower, utilizing a variety of blaster type weapons and thermal grenades, although clones are able to acquire heavier weapons, such as miniguns and rocket launchers as the game progresses. Because of the projectile nature of these weapons clone character combat can be fought as a variety of distances. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Experience an all-new and exciting Clone Wars storyline that bridges the gap between season one and two of the TV series as you learn more about the mysterious bounty hunter Cad Bane and hunt down the all-new Skakoan super villain Kul Teska.</li> <li>Play as your favorite Jedi heroes including Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, Mace Windu, and Kit Fisto.</li> <li>Slice and dice your way through Separatist droids with your lightsaber and Force powers and use your agility to perform amazing leaps and navigate levels filled with interactivity.</li> <li>Turn your enemies into weapons as you commandeer droids and use their unique abilities to blast enemies and solve puzzles as a Jedi.</li> <li>Be part of an elite clone trooper squad with unique gameplay that puts firepower at your fingertips.

Built around two-player cooperative action, the accessible controls and family-friendly gameplay bring Star Wars fans across generations together like never before to fight the evil Separatists and restore peace to the galaxy. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Gameplay in <i>Star Wars the Clone Wars: Republic Heroes</i> is mission-based. Players can choose to approach the action as either a Jedi or a clone class character. Playing as a Jedi you have access to eight playable characters, and as a clone you play as one of a group of clones. The game was developed with co-op play in mind, which means players can more or less count on never fighting alone, which is a good thing considering the hordes of battle droids and other enemies you will face. The game also features a puzzle-solving gameplay component, as well as an upgrade system based on the collection of ""Force Orbs"" scattered throughout the game environment. <p/> <b>Weapons and Combat</b><br/> Keeping with the games\' user friendly approach, the control scheme has been designed with Jedi character\'s lightsaber and force powers, as well as clone characters firing trigger accessible from a single input source. Because of the difference in the character classes weapons, combat differs depending on the class chosen. Due to their reliance on the their lightsabers, Jedi will mostly engage enemies at close range, although force power attacks can allow for more distance from targets. In addition, utilizing Jedi powers at point blank range players are able to engage in ""droidjacking,"" which allows a Jedi to take control of a droid\'s weapons system and other abilities. On the other hand, clone character combat relies more on firepower, utilizing a variety of blaster type weapons and thermal grenades, although clones are able to acquire heavier weapons, such as miniguns and rocket launchers as the game progresses. Because of the projectile nature of these weapons clone character combat can be fought as a variety of distances. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Experience an all-new and exciting Clone Wars storyline that bridges the gap between season one and two of the TV series as you learn more about the mysterious bounty hunter Cad Bane and hunt down the all-new Skakoan super villain Kul Teska.</li> <li>Play as your favorite Jedi heroes including Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, Mace Windu, and Kit Fisto.</li> <li>Slice and dice your way through Separatist droids with your lightsaber and Force powers and use your agility to perform amazing leaps and navigate levels filled with interactivity.</li> <li>Turn your enemies into weapons as you commandeer droids and use their unique abilities to blast enemies and solve puzzles as a Jedi.</li> <li>Be part of an elite clone trooper squad with unique gameplay that puts firepower at your fingertips.

For the first time ever, players can fight as their favorite Jedi and clone troopers from the preeminent animated television series &ndash; from familiar faces like Anakin Skywalker to new heroes like Clone Captain Rex. A brand-new storyline, which bridges the gap between season one and two, takes the player on a multifaceted adventure to stop a mysterious techno assassin&rsquo;s destructive plot. Built around two-player cooperative action, the accessible controls and family-friendly gameplay bring Star Wars fans across generations together like never before to fight the evil Separatists and restore peace to the galaxy. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Gameplay in <i>Star Wars the Clone Wars: Republic Heroes</i> is mission-based. Players can choose to approach the action as either a Jedi or a clone class character. Playing as a Jedi you have access to eight playable characters, and as a clone you play as one of a group of clones. The game was developed with co-op play in mind, which means players can more or less count on never fighting alone, which is a good thing considering the hordes of battle droids and other enemies you will face. The game also features a puzzle-solving gameplay component, as well as an upgrade system based on the collection of ""Force Orbs"" scattered throughout the game environment. <p/> <b>Weapons and Combat</b><br/> Keeping with the games\' user friendly approach, the control scheme has been designed with Jedi character\'s lightsaber and force powers, as well as clone characters firing trigger accessible from a single input source. Because of the difference in the character classes weapons, combat differs depending on the class chosen. Due to their reliance on the their lightsabers, Jedi will mostly engage enemies at close range, although force power attacks can allow for more distance from targets. In addition, utilizing Jedi powers at point blank range players are able to engage in ""droidjacking,"" which allows a Jedi to take control of a droid\'s weapons system and other abilities. On the other hand, clone character combat relies more on firepower, utilizing a variety of blaster type weapons and thermal grenades, although clones are able to acquire heavier weapons, such as miniguns and rocket launchers as the game progresses. Because of the projectile nature of these weapons clone character combat can be fought as a variety of distances. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Experience an all-new and exciting Clone Wars storyline that bridges the gap between season one and two of the TV series as you learn more about the mysterious bounty hunter Cad Bane and hunt down the all-new Skakoan super villain Kul Teska.</li> <li>Play as your favorite Jedi heroes including Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, Mace Windu, and Kit Fisto.</li> <li>Slice and dice your way through Separatist droids with your lightsaber and Force powers and use your agility to perform amazing leaps and navigate levels filled with interactivity.</li> <li>Turn your enemies into weapons as you commandeer droids and use their unique abilities to blast enemies and solve puzzles as a Jedi.</li> <li>Be part of an elite clone trooper squad with unique gameplay that puts firepower at your fingertips.

In both of these though the second-to-second, fast-paced action is rooted in the wealth of powerups strewn throughout the track. These are addictive in their use and dramatic and devastating when used against opposing racers.

Powerups in the game include:<br/> <ul> <li><u>Shock</u> - An electromagnetic pulse that homes in on the nearest car or packs of cars, surrounding you.</li> <li><u>Barge</u> - An energy wave weapon designed to be unleashed at close range to hurl enemy drivers off course.</li> <li><u>Shunt</u> - A forward firing projectile that can be used to bring you closer to competitors or blast them out of the way.</li> <li><u>Nitro</u> - A short, powerful speed boost designed to get the driver back in contention when he/she falls behind.</li> <li><u>Mines</u> - Explosive devices dropped out on to the track that blow apart any car that runs them over.</li> <li><u>Repair</u> - A way to regain health without making a pit stop at a repair shop. Unlike other powerups, these are used instantly instead of being stored for later use.</li> </ul> <p/> <b>Multiplayer Support and Game Modes</b><br/> <i>Blur</i> is designed from the ground up to provide an enthralling multiplayer experience both online and offline. Online players with enjoy support for up to 20 player races, while local offline play features 2-4 player, four-way split screen support through a single console and up to 20 player support via system link console configurations. Within races players will have the choice to play either competitively and cooperative, in a variety of play modes that offer a mix of customization and automation. Just a few of the race parameters that can be customized are locale, car class and number of racers. Players can also choose to let the game handle the specifics of race particulars with World Tour mode, which will string together race after race randomly, allowing friends to simply concentrate on the fun. <p/> <b>Tracks and Cars</b><br/> The gameworld of <i>Blur</i> contains an impressive array of tracks and cars. Players can expect to pile up the powerups and put the pedal to the metal across tracks set throughout 14 real cities and other locations throughout the world, each of these featuring recognizable streets and landmarks.

Here players assume the role of an up-and-coming racer who is looking to make a name for himself in the underground racing scene, but the competition is fierce. As you take on the series of races, you\'ll meet a bunch of recurring characters. Some of these characters will be rivals, others perhaps will act as mentors, and some may be something else entirely. The only thing that is certain in the world of <i>Blur</i> is that in a race there are winners and losers, and racers will do anything to reach the finish line first. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Although filled with the beautifully elaborate racing environments, realistic damage effects and a long list of available cars usually only found in simulation racers, <i>Blur</i> is an arcade racer through and through. Its single player campaign revolves around the game\'s Career Mode, while in multiplayer there are additional options, including customizable cooperative and competitive races. In both of these though the second-to-second, fast-paced action is rooted in the wealth of powerups strewn throughout the track. These are addictive in their use and dramatic and devastating when used against opposing racers. With each successive race that players engage in they will use their collection of powerups to engage in vehicular combat of all sorts as they make their way to the finish. The game employs a fictional in-game social networking system allowing communication between drivers, and through this a way for players to establish alliances, find mentors and get familiar with the tactics of opponents. Monetary rewards are accumulated by drivers not only for success in competition, but by generous fans earned during races and for predetermined side challenges within races, proposed by those same fans. With the cash accumulated through all these, players can buy new cars and upgrade their ability to use powerups and keep their career going. <p/> <b>Powerups</b><br/> An impressive array of powerups are part and parcel to the vehicular combat that takes place <i>Blur</i>. These are spread across each of the game\'s tracks and for the most part can be used at any time. Drivers start out with the ability to sock away up to two of these, but with success players can upgrade to add additional slots and even increase the potency of the powerups that they have. Powerups in the game include:<br/> <ul> <li><u>Shock</u> - An electromagnetic pulse that homes in on the nearest car or packs of cars, surrounding you.</li> <li><u>Barge</u> - An energy wave weapon designed to be unleashed at close range to hurl enemy drivers off course.</li> <li><u>Shunt</u> - A forward firing projectile that can be used to bring you closer to competitors or blast them out of the way.</li> <li><u>Nitro</u> - A short, powerful speed boost designed to get the driver back in contention when he/she falls behind.</li> <li><u>Mines</u> - Explosive devices dropped out on to the track that blow apart any car that runs them over.</li> <li><u>Repair</u> - A way to regain health without making a pit stop at a repair shop. Unlike other powerups, these are used instantly instead of being stored for later use.</li> </ul> <p/> <b>Multiplayer Support and Game Modes</b><br/> <i>Blur</i> is designed from the ground up to provide an enthralling multiplayer experience both online and offline. Online players with enjoy support for up to 20 player races, while local offline play features 2-4 player, four-way split screen support through a single console and up to 20 player support via system link console configurations. Within races players will have the choice to play either competitively and cooperative, in a variety of play modes that offer a mix of customization and automation. Just a few of the race parameters that can be customized are locale, car class and number of racers. Players can also choose to let the game handle the specifics of race particulars with World Tour mode, which will string together race after race randomly, allowing friends to simply concentrate on the fun. <p/> <b>Tracks and Cars</b><br/> The gameworld of <i>Blur</i> contains an impressive array of tracks and cars. Players can expect to pile up the powerups and put the pedal to the metal across tracks set throughout 14 real cities and other locations throughout the world, each of these featuring recognizable streets and landmarks. Just a few of these include, London, San Francisco, Barcelona and Los Angeles. The game is also filled with over 50 fully licensed cars, unlockable and purchasable throughout the game. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Powerups</b> - Collect a variety of addictive dynamic powerups and use them independently or combo them strategically to take out your opponents.</li> <li><b>Real Racing</b> - Dramatic collisions, realistic damage, stunning racing environments, real world locations and more than 50 licensed photo-realistic cars from the top manufacturers around the world.</li> <li><b>Social Network</b> - Unique story-driving social network interface evolves as you compete in different races, make new friends, rivals and fans, and connect with other racers both in game and in real life.</li> <li><b>Multiplayer Support</b> - Features online multiplayer supporting competitive and cooperative game play for up to 20 racers and 4 player split-screen multiplayer in local offline play.</li> <li><b>Multiple Reward System</b> - Players can receive cash rewards to be used in-game in multiple ways including: winning races, gifts from in-game fans, and by completing fan determined side challenges.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Each level has a &#8220;par&#8221; for the number of objects suggested to finish the level. Beating a level with under par, earns &#8220;Ollars&#8221;, the in-game currency, which players can use to purchase new levels and music.', '<table border=""0""> <tr> <td> <table border=""0""> <tr> <td> <a name=""product_description""></a> <i>Scribblenauts</i> is a unique single player side-scrolling action game for the Nintendo DS that challenges players to solve spatially oriented puzzles like no game before it. In it players use an in-game notepad/keyboard, as well as the touch screen and stylus of the Nintendo DS, to conjure up solutions to the obstacles placed in the path of the game\'s hero. Solutions are manifested in the form of literally thousands of items--many very unexpected--that are called up and take on a life of their own, resulting in puzzle-solving that is limited only by the player\'s imagination. <style type=""text/css""> .caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; } </style> <p/> <table align=right width=310 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002B1TDV8.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=795,height=608\'); return false;""><img alt=""Maxwell with a Starite in a tree in \'Scribblenauts\'"" title=""Maxwell with a Starite in a tree in \'Scribblenauts\'"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002B1TDV8.01.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""300"" height=""227""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Get creative in collecting Starites.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002B1TDV8.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=795,height=608\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table> <table width=""210"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" align=""left"" cellspacing=""0""> <tr> <td><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002B1TDV8.logo.200.jpg"" align=""center"" alt=""\'Scribblenauts\' game logo"" title=""\'Scribblenauts\' game logo"" width=""200"" height=""57""><br/> <small><center><b><i></i></b></center></small></td></tr></table> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Based around 2D side-scrolling action and word play, the premise of <i>Scribblenauts</i> is simple; quite literally, anything you write, you can use and reuse in the game. Players use the DS\' touch-screen and the in-game notepad/keyboard to help their character, Maxwell, as he moves throughout 220 increasingly difficult levels on his never-ending quest for the star-like ""Starites."" But it is not as easy as reaching up and plucking a Starite. Attaining them requires Maxwell to solve spatially oriented puzzles. To do this players describe objects via the notepad/keyboard, which in turn appear on the game screen and facilitate the starite making its way to Maxwell. There are literally thousands of items in the game, both utilitarian like ladders, ropes, cars and buses, to the outlandish items, such as invisibility cloaks, pirates and black holes. There are time limits on levels, as well as a limitation to the number of items that can be used per level. But regardless of these restrictions, the game is all about experimentation, imagination and endless replay value as players open their minds to the nearly limitless possibilities that are sure to make <i>Scribblenauts</i> unlike any side-scrolling platformer they have ever played. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Create Your Own Interactive Experience</b> - Objects you write down in the game are only limited by your imagination.</li> <li><b>Everyone Can Play</b> - <i>Scribblenauts</i> features all-ages pick-up-and-play fun for everyone.</li> <li><b>Touch-screen Controls</b> - Easy to pick up and play on Nintendo DS. If you can tap, you can play.</li> <li><b>Unlimited Replay Value</b> - Use less objects to increase your score, or experiment with different objects for endless replay value.

There are 9 attacking and 5 defensive general styles, as well as 13 special case teams with their own unique style of play, based on the real world.</li> <li><b>Pre-match Scouting Reports</b> &ndash; Learning to play professional soccer the correct way is even easier now with insight from your manager. Scout Reports will provide a pre-match scouting report helping plan your attack against every opponent, highlighting their team style and key players to watch out for, giving you tactical advice on how to beat them.</li> <li><b>Be A Pro: Club and Country</b> &ndash; Take your player from the beginning of his career to the peak of international stardom in the new revamped Be A Pro mode. Grow your professional player at the club level and work your way into your national team in one of the most grueling challenges of any professional players career.</li> <li><b>Season Mode</b> &ndash; Similar to Manager Mode, but without some of the complexities such as player transfers and salaries, Season Mode provides a more accessible option of guiding your favorite team to glory. Take your club through the most in-depth Season Mode to date and compete in official league fixtures, cup and continental competitions. This mode allows you to focus on playing matches with the current crop of players available in your club, making it a lighter, faster way to take your team to the top.</li> <li><b>Updated Collision System</b> &ndash; New collision avoidance system means that players are less likely to get in the way and collide with team mates.</li> <li><b>Improved Teammates Support</b> &ndash; Team mates are now more intelligent, providing a greater level of support. Support runs are now more effective, and there are increased passing and crossing options as a result.</li> <li><b>Improved Goalkeepers</b> &ndash; Goalkeeper AI intelligence has been improved, so that keepers now make more authentic decisions, with improved variation in shot stopping and deflections. They are quicker off their line in 1 on 1 situation, and behave in line with their overall team styles.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Screenshots</b>:<br/> <table cellspacing=""0"" align=""center""> <tr> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BCVFNQ.02.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=636,height=444\'); return false;""><img alt=""Striking towards the goal in FIFA Soccer 10"" title=""Striking towards the goal in FIFA Soccer 10"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BCVFNQ.02.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Tense head to head battles.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BCVFNQ.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=636,height=444\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BCVFNQ.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=636,height=444\'); return false;""><img alt=""Alone against the goalkeeper in FIFA Soccer 10"" title=""Alone against the goalkeeper in FIFA Soccer 10"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BCVFNQ.03.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Game-changing \'Boosters\'.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BCVFNQ.03.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=636,height=444\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BCVFNQ.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=636,height=444\'); return false;""><img alt=""A crane shot of on-field action in FIFA Soccer 10"" title=""A crane shot of on-field action in FIFA Soccer 10"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BCVFNQ.04.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br/> <center> <span class=""caption"">International soccer favorites.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BCVFNQ.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=636,height=444\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BCVFNQ.05.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=636,height=444\'); return false;""><img alt=""A penalty kick in FIFA Soccer 10"" title=""A penalty kick in FIFA Soccer 10"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BCVFNQ.05.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">2-on-2 online play.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BCVFNQ.05.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=636,height=444\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by
