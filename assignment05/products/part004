Strengths include a design that is really easy to either zoom through, or take more time and explore. For example, in the first level, all you need to do is fix a bridge and find a walking stick, and you're done. But you can take much more time and explore if you want to.

Theres no mouse support and significant blurring at high resolutions (the menus dont scale). PC users are used to accessing all the stats, info, batting orders, etc., at the touch of the mouse.

Strengths include a design that is really easy to either zoom through, or take more time and explore. For example, in the first level, all you need to do is fix a bridge and find a walking stick, and you're done. But you can take much more time and explore if you want to. The only thing we'd fix is to add a running mode -- Bilbo is a little slow at times, and our 16 year old seasoned tester found some of the puzzles really tough.

You can simply play through it as a single player, which offers up an experience that is very similar to the PSone trilogy, or you can hop online and partner with up to three additional human players for an action-packed extravganza that is quite unlike anything you\'ve come across before. Interestingly, the content for both methods of play is virtually identical. In such, you can bounce back and forth between online and offline play with the same save data. I found this to be extremely beneficial. Of course, I\'d prefer to work my way through the game with teammates, but I did find that if my friends are not logged in and the only people I can partner with give new meaning to the word ""annoying,"" I\'ll play offline.</P> <P>Sticking to its guns, the gameplay hasn\'t changed too much over the years. Headshots are once again highlighted with text, the lower shoulders are used for strafing, and you still have the luxury of tapping into a handy auto targeting system for frenzied fightss. The one area where you will see significant change is in the missions. In past Syphon Filter games, you had to complete most of the objectives and be mindful of parameters to progress to the next stage. In The Omega Strain, the theory has changed to ""anything goes."" Usually, there is only one critical objective on each stage that must be completed to move on. The remainder of the goals (which can number close to 15 for a level) are more or less optional for the player(s). The game won\'t come to a screeching halt if you ignore them. You can even finish a level by disregarding all parameters (like don\'t shoot the good guys) and still move on. So why would you even bother messing with additional feats? Simply because the rewards that they bring couldn\'t be more delicious.</P> <P>All of your accomplishments and performances are tracked. Everything from shot accuracy to time you spend in a level are taken into consideration. Much like a role-playing game, your character will gain levels as experience is accumulated. You\'ll begin the game as a Field Agent and can eventually work your way through 21 additional ranks to Commander in Chief. Through extensive play, you can also earn medals, commendations from the NPCs, and Special Agency Ratings. Each one of these attainments (which number close to 100) rewards the player with a new weapon or power-up.</P> <P>The density of unlockable armaments that you can wrap your hands around is truly unheard of, and is reason enough for players to work their way through the game over and over again. Although Omega Strain is the same, playing solo and with a group of friends produces two completely different results. Given the gargantuan size of the levels, never before has vocal communication (via the headset) been so necessary and constant.

I\'m happy to report that, while this is clearly a groundbreaking game, it does keep most of the strengths (and some of the weaknesses) of its forebears. The way this title manages to meld the multiplayer and single-player portions into a cohesive whole is quite amazing, and I think this may well point to the direction that many games will head in the future. I love the fact that, while you can tackle the missions alone, playing in co-op actually creates a different experience, allowing you to access previously inaccessible areas and use teamwork for both strategy and to more quickly complete level goals. It\'s great fun, if a bit uneven. If not for the unimpressive graphics, sometimes suspect auto-targeting, and its irritating habit of re-spawning your character in seemingly random locations; this could have been an all-time classic. As it is, it\'s another great addition to the PS2 online library.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>8.5 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Matt Helgeson</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Battle through 10 globe-spanning levels from Hong Kong to San Francisco as a plot to restore honor unfolds.', '<P>With the electrifying combat prowess of Jet Li at your fingertips, and the ostentatious fight choreography of Cory Yuen fueling your every move, Rise to Honor successfully captures the cinematic flair and rip-roaring excitement of a Hong Kong action film. Jet Li\'s superlative fighting style has been replicated perfectly through motion capture technology. As you catapult off of a wall into a spin kick, and exchange countering attacks with a foe in a lengthy choreographed sequence that can best be described as poetry in motion, you really do get the feeling that you\'ve stepped into the shoes of the almighty Jet Li.</P> <P>To successfully bring Li\'s signature fighting style to the video game front, Sony Computer Entertainment America\'s Foster City studio developed an innovative combat system that allows gamers to assail multiple enemies at once. With context-specific moves assigned to the right analog stick, you can seamlessly transfer attacks from one foe to the next. For instance, if you find yourself in a situation where two enemies are advancing from opposite sides, tapping to the right will throw a jab at the enemy on the right, then hitting left will send a back kick to the enemy on the left. </P> <P>Assuredly, the combat system feels a little awkward at first, but once you understand its intricacies, you\'ll love it. Taking down 30 enemies without getting hit truly is a remarkable feeling. The only area where this unique formula comes up a little short is in countering attacks. To dodge a move, you simply need to hold the counter button and tap the analog stick in the direction of the foe when an attack is thrown. Rather than pushing gamers to hone their reflexes, the timing of your counter doesn\'t have to be precise. In fact, you can simply jam in the direction of the foe without penalty &#8211; which results in uncontested retaliatory strikes.</P> <P>To offset the martial arts and inject variety into the mix, Sony has incorporated run and gun and stealth sequences. These stage-specific gameplay styles appear frequently, but neither matches the quality of the hand-to-hand combat. As clunky as the shootout controls can be, and as odd as it is that you never once have to reload, I actually enjoy the simplicity and epic explosiveness of mowing down dozens of enemies in no time flat. As for the stealth exercises, let\'s just say that you\'re basically playing the children\'s game ""Red Light, Green Light"" with a bunch of dimwitted security guards with flashlights. In other words, they couldn\'t be more dreadful.</P> <P>As is the case with most brawlers, Rise to Honor is as linear as linear can get, and does little to invite gamers back for a second time. The entire game can be completed in roughly five to eight hours. As rewarding as the hand-to-hand combat is, Rise to Honor\'s thrills are short lived. It\'s an enjoyable play, but much like Jet Li\'s films, is nothing more than a lazy afternoon of fun.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Jet Li stars in a beat &#8216;em up with motion-captured, choreographed sequences and unique analog fighting <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>Other than the awkward running animation, this game\'s visuals scream ""big budget."" It looks great. <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>The soundtrack is hit or miss, but I absolutely love the fact that the characters speak Cantonese in Hong Kong and English in the U.S. <BR><BR><B>Playability:</B><BR>The analog combat system works incredibly well <BR><BR><B>Entertainment:</B><BR>Highly enjoyable, yet far too linear and way too short <BR><BR><B>Replay:</B><BR>Low <BR><BR>Rated: <B>7 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Andrew Reiner</B><BR>Issue: <B>March 2004</B><BR><BR><B>2nd Opinion:</B><BR> I must say I\'m impressed at how well Rise to Honor pulls off the kung-fu movie experience. Sure, it\'s a tad short and can be a bit repetitive at times, but overall it\'s not a bad attempt at mixing the two art forms into a meaningful, and at times, entertaining game/movie. However, I want to make it clear that I\'m just referring to the game\'s overall presentation and story arc, not the combat system that I feel leaves a lot to be desired. Like Xbox\'s Grabbed By The Ghoulies, Rise uses the right analog stick to deliver its combat, which is not only limiting but inaccurate, and quite frankly annoying as hell. Brawlers are typically shallow, so I won\'t hold that against this title, but its combat system just doesn\'t offer the precise control and interaction that I\'m looking for in a game. Not a bad rental if you love Jet Li, but everyone else should steer clear. <BR><BR>Rated: <B>6.5 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Andy McNamara</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Play in full adventure mode with a storyline, or in tournament battle mode.', '<P>If Pokemon had been around when I was 10, I would have been that crazy kid on your block who lived and breathed Pokemon in all its forms. However, the days that this would have interested me have passed, and I can only see this game for what it is: a shining example of working just hard enough to keep a franchise alive. The game isn\'t glaringly sub-standard, but there was little effort put into innovation or moving the series forward.</P> <P>Colosseum is essentially two games, a Story Mode and a Battle Mode (which resembles the N64 Stadium titles). The plot of Story Mode is surprisingly dark and it would have been great for a 30 minute television episode; but, it doesn\'t really sustain a 30 hour RPG. You control a sort of anti-hero who steals a valuable accessory from the evil organization he is working for. It turns out that this item allows the wearer to snag Shadow Pokemon (which are Pok&#xC3;&#xA9;mon who have had their hearts sealed and who are generally ornery and unpredictable) away from their masters. It\'s a good thing that this thievery is encouraged, because in the barren wasteland setting, it is impossible to go out and collect Pokemon from the wild. Instead, you pump up your collection by stealing other people\'s monsters, gradually opening their hearts, and then having them fight by your side.</P> <P>The absence of collecting in the traditional sense might come as a shock to those accustomed to the handheld RPGs, but the Battle Mode is as familiar as can be, with several types of matches to fight against the computer or your friends, providing they have Game Boy Advances. Connectivity is a big aspect of Colosseum; not only can you hook up your GBA and import your collection from Ruby or Sapphire, but you also need it if you want to play multiplayer Battle Mode. If you and your friends are pumped up about battling each other in the arena, though, odds are that you already have GBAs and nearly unbeatable Poke battalions from the previous games, so this requirement might not be too much of a drawback.</P> <P>What is a drawback, however, is the ridiculously low level of challenge. Now, I understand that the game is geared toward younger players, but I was at least five hours into it before I got to a battle that didn\'t feel like it was set to ""tutorial"" difficulty. For a world where practically everyone trains Pokemon, there sure are a lot of awful trainers wandering around. The fact that my victory was assured before the battle even started just made me lose interest even faster.</P> <P>If you\'re a fan, you\'ll love the premise, the gameplay, and the overwhelming number of little critters to collect and bend to your will. Even though none of these elements are so astounding as to bring outsiders into the fold, the franchise\'s debut on the GameCube (Pokemon Channel doesn\'t count) is a trainer\'s dream come true.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Bring the two reigning genres of Pok&#xC3;&#xA9;mon games together under a single title <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>The environments are dull, but the creatures look as round, bouncy, and cuddly as you ever wanted them to <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>Pika Pika?

The problem is that we got what we asked for, and I for one don\'t like it all too much. What was once a handheld RPG with the gotta-catch-&#8216;em-all hook is now a bland and (because of the Game Boy editions) predicable trek that would look more at home on the N64. While some attack and environmental effects are nice, others are embarrassingly bad. The game also features a sadly mixed bag of sound &#8211; your critters and the townsfolk offer nothing more than beeps, but the score is painfully perky and overdone. Fans will and should pick this up. But many old devotees will be disappointed because, at best, Colosseum feels like a sad shell of the franchise\'s glory days and at worst, a poor example in the RPG genre.  <BR><BR>Rated: <B>6.75 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Lisa Mason</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']",Nintendo,"['>#3,869 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#15 in Video Games > More Systems > GameCube > Games', '>#963 in Video Games > PC Games']",$199.99,Video Games,B00009WAUF

If there is, perhaps James Bond is it. It\'s an almost guaranteed seller, which is perhaps the reason that EA\'s last entry in the series, James Bond 007: NightFire, seemed to be cruising on autopilot. Sure, it was fun and breezy &#8211; I really liked it at the time &#8211; but it didn\'t really offer much in terms of depth or novel concepts. It almost felt like the development team had become a little too comfortable with its standard mix of FPS, track shooting, and driving.</P> <P>Perhaps sensing that ennui was setting in, EA boldly chucked its 007 blueprint and opted to craft Everything or Nothing as a third-person action/adventure. Given that the last time Bond went third person, Tomorrow Never Dies, was an out-and-out disaster, this game represents a pretty big risk for the conservative gang at EA. Does it pay off? For the most part, the answer is yes.</P> <P>One of the big things this title brings to the table is Bond\'s rappel gun, which is used frequently and adds a nice dimension of verticality to the levels. It\'s pretty cool to be storming down the side of a building, dodging explosions and capping enemies with glee. In another instance, you\'ll forgo the rappel altogether, and jump off the side of a cliff in order to save a plummeting damsel.</P> <P>It\'s these sequences that really made Everything or Nothing for me. While the basic third-person shooting is well and good, EoN supplies the flashy, over-the-top stunts that one expects from the Bond films. I was satisfied with the old FPS-action, but this new format gives EoN a bombastic panache and a tremendous amount of variety. Whether you\'re running roughshod over a Central American city in a tank, using some of the cool gadgets like the spider bot, or trying to drive your motorcycle onto a moving plane before it takes off, EoN has a wicked sense of daring and a brass set of balls.</P> <P>This is a Hollywood blockbuster in every sense of the word, and features some of the biggest star power ever seen in a game. Including Monty Python alum John Cleese as Q, Maxim favorite Shannon Elizabeth, professional creep Willem Dafoe, and Pierce Brosnan, this is a truly A-list cast. It\'s even more significant for the fact that this is an adventure unique to video games, not based on any movie project. If you still doubt that gaming is growing larger than the movie industry, here\'s further&nbsp;proof.</P> <P>Despite its daring, varied design and big-time production values, it\'s not perfect. There are frequent problems with camera view, and the auto-targeting vacillates between adequate and maddening. However, good games can make you overlook their flaws, and on this count Everything or Nothing is a success. Is it the next great evolution of gaming? Perhaps not, but it is a step towards creating the ultimate James Bond title.</P> <P>The Edge</P> <P>Although Electronic Arts does a good job of making sure its multi-system games are pretty comporably across all three platforms, there are always advantages to certain consoles. Unsurprisingly, the Xbox EoN looks the best, althought it\'s not pushing the limits of the hardware. On PS2, there isn\'t as much graphical degradation as you might expect, and the four shoulders are handy in many situations. So, let\'s call these two a draw, which brings us to the GameCube. Nitendo definitely comes in third here, mostly due to the lack of buttons. On Xbox and PS2, you have separate buttons for hugging the wall and crouch. On the \'Cube, both moves are done with the Z-button, which sometimes means you crouch when you want to hug.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Out with FPS, in with over-the-top third-person adventuring <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>Not an award-winner, but as solid as you expect from an EA product <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>Mya\'s Bond theme is even worse than Madonna\'s; but it does feature a great score and tons of celeb voiceovers <BR><BR><B>Playability:</B><BR>The usual complaints (camera, auto-aim) don\'t detract too much from the experience <BR><BR><B>Entertainment:</B><BR>It\'s good to see EA taking chances with this property again <BR><BR><B>Replay:</B><BR>Moderate <BR><BR>Rated: <B>8.5 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Matt Helgeson</B><BR>Issue: <B>March 2004</B><BR><BR><B>2nd Opinion:</B><BR> Bond\'s new video game adventure was a lot more enjoyable for me than his last few cinematic outings. Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist? Who thought that was a good idea? While Shannon Elizabeth may not be an acting juggernaut, Everything or Nothing still feels like it could have worked on the big screen. The frequent switches in action keep it moving along at a nice pace and make it hard to put down. I especially like some of the more creative action stages, such as the free fall down the side of the cliff. The third-person shooting levels which make up the meat of the game are fun and work pretty well on Xbox and PS2, although the GameCube controls came up a bit short. While I preferred playing this title on the Xbox, it\'s a solid release on all three systems, and it\'s a great chance to see Bond in an adventure that\'s (a little) less ridiculous than most of his recent missions.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>8.75 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Jeremy Zoss</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Using Game Boy Advance units as controllers to receive unique information, up to 4 players embark on this real-time, hack-and-slash journey through a poisoned world. Communication and teamwork are vital for survival in this latest Final Fantasy epic.', '', 'As renowned as the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series has become over the years, the release of <i>Crystal Chronicles</i> brings with it an air of unfamiliarity. Although many of its elements tie into the greater <i>Final Fantasy</i> universe, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.', ""While it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best from <i>Final Fantasy</i>, and with each passing release, Square has delivered. <i>Crystal Chronicles</i> may break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren."", 'As stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. The <i>Final Fantasy</i> games are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought in <i>Crystal Chronicles</i>. Cinematic flair is also noticeablyabsent.', ""The gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything."", ""When a player accesses the GBA, their character on the TV cannot be controlled. Not only does this leave them open to attack, it more or less halts any progress that the group can make. So basically, you still find yourself sitting around waiting for your buddy to make preparations, but instead, you're doing it with a controller that has fewer buttons and dying batteries."", ""To make matters worse, players must also keep an eye on a bucket. To prevent characters from scattering and trying to run in different directions, the bucket emits a field of energy that covers roughly 80 percent of the screen. If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games."", ""When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power."", 'There\'s little here that truly excites. <i>Crystal Chronicles</i> plays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanct <i>Final Fantasy</i> name.<br /><br /><b>Concept:</b><br />A hack n\' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucket <br /><br /><b>Graphics:</b><br />Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designs <br /><br /><b>Sound:</b><br />Not the familiar <i>Final Fantasy</i> melodies, but memorable nonetheless <br /><br /><b>Playability:</b><br />Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combos <br /><br /><b>Entertainment:</b><br />A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating play <br /><br /><b>Replay:</b><br />Moderately High <br /><br />Rated: <b>7 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Andrew Reiner</b><br />Issue: <b>February 2004</b><br /><br /><b>2nd Opinion:</b><br /> <i>Crystal Chronicles</i> is here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game. It seems like for every thing <i>FF: CC</i> does right, it does two things wrong. Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it\'s less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas. The effects and character models are cool, but downtimes really drag and many cutscenes look awfully similar. The worst part, though, is that character advancement is the slowest I\'ve ever seen. Beat a boss and get your choice of +1 to one of your stats! Thrilling. There is certainly some enjoyment to be had here, but it\'s sprinkled somewhat thinly among all of the lame and boring parts. On a console with a lot of great four-player titles, <i>Crystal Chronicles</i> does very little to distinguish itself.<br /><br />Rated: <b>7 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Adam Biessener</b><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0"" /></a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Planet Hippitron is short on natural resources - to secure some, Scooter must win the powerful ""Super Ribbinite"". To do that, he\'ll race on 20 different courses, across 5 different worlds. Beat all your opponents at Frolfing to earn the prize -- and save your world!', '<P>Ribbit King, a truly twisted title that creates a new sport called Frolf (which is, basically, golfing with frogs instead of balls), is yet another game aimed at hardcore devotees of Japanese whimsy. You know who you are: You\'ve beaten Rez 18 times. You\'ve written your own arrangements of the music in Gitaroo-Man for string quartet and woodwinds. On your left shoulder is a Mister Mosquito tattoo. I can almost imagine you interrupting me right now, whispering, ""Matt, don\'t speak. You had me at Frolf."" [cue tears and sappy music]</P> <P>The rest of you might want to consider the decision to buy Ribbit King a little more carefully. While the basic mechanics are that of a simplified golf game (with a rudimentary two-click swing), the real meat of the Ribbit King experience comes from exploring the strange ""gimmicks"" strewn throughout each course. These include spiderwebs that can bounce your frog further distances, giant snakes that shake you in their jaws until you jiggle the analog stick to break free, or even conveyor belts that take frogs to otherwise inaccessible platforms. Much of your score depends on mastering these gimmick combos, which earn you big points (often more than getting the frog in the hole). This makes for an odd brand of play, but often the gimmicks are too random in effect to really allow for strategy. Many times, you\'ll hit what looks like a bum shot, only to be whisked through an unforeseen sequence of gimmicks that place you right up to the hole. While it\'s certainly amusing, after a time the heavy reliance on gimmicks felt, well, kind of gimmicky. </P> <P>After the novelty is gone, it\'s an adequate, if goofy, golf title with passable technical execution. The camera system and graphics engine certainly won\'t win any awards (there are definitely times when the poor camera and overhead view make it difficult to aim&nbsp;&#8211; especially on the futuristic levels), but I guess that\'s not really the point. All in all, this feels like a stand-alone game that would have done better as a cool Mario Golf minigame mode.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Frolf: where sport and amphibious life meet! <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>A charming art style makes the ho-hum graphics somewhat irrelevant <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>Yippie-skippy-synthy-plinky-Casio-doo-de-dah <BR><BR><B>Playability:</B><BR>I think a three-click swing would have made this a little more interesting, but it\'s solid overall <BR><BR><B>Entertainment:</B><BR>Japanophiles, cute-fetishists: Reserve your copy now.

It\'s too basic and odd to strike a chord with mainstream gamers. But those who like their games heavy on Japanese flavor will definitely be pleased with this strange golf title. It looks a little bit sharper on the GameCube than on the PS2, but it\'s a bizarrely fun time on either system, and the unlockable cartoons on the bonus disc are a hoot. Yep, it\'s definitely as odd as it sounds, but if that\'s your thing (I know it\'s mine), then you\'ll have a blast with this title.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>7.5 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Jeremy Zoss</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Prince of Persia: Sands of Time,,"['Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a 3D platformer which focuses on acrobatics and agility. Throughout much of the game, the player must attempt to traverse the palace by running across walls, ascending or descending chasms by jumping back and forth between walls, avoiding traps, climbing structures and jumping from platform to platform, making other types of well-timed leaps, solving puzzles, and using discovered objects to progress. Combat has a heavy focus on using acrobatics to defeat foes. One example is the ability of the Prince to rebound off walls in order to strike enemies decisively. The player can also vault over the enemies\' backs and then finish them off. The player generally attacks enemies and blocks using a sword, although only the Dagger of Time can defeat humanoid enemies, with the exception of the final sword that is acquired in the game. The Dagger of Time contains ""charges"" of the Sands of Time from the hourglass that allow the Prince to control time. The Prince has the ability to ""rewind"" time and travel up to ten seconds into the past. While using this ability, all sounds and previous action play backwards. For example, if the Prince was struck by an enemy attack during the rewound period, the health he lost will be given back to him, or a bridge that was destroyed a few seconds ago will repair itself. He can also save himself from death by falling, by rewinding time.

As they progress through the palace the pair are constantly waylaid by Sand Monsters and the deadly network of traps set in motion in the hopes of killing the creatures. The Prince becomes steadily more worn until his princely armor is mere shreds and his body covered bloody wounds Early in the game, the player will receive help from a non-playable character named Farah. She will assist in solving puzzles too complex for one person. During fights with sand creatures, she will also shoot arrows in an attempt to assist the player. If she dies, the game ends. Plot[edit] King Sharaman of Persia and his son, known only as the Prince, pass through India en route to Azad and conquer a city with the aid of the local Maharajah's traitorous Vizier. During the battle the Prince seeks to win honour and glory in his first battle and heads straight to the Maharajah's treasure vaults, where he discovers the mythical Sands of Time safely contained within their Hourglass and the Dagger of Time, which he quickly learns can turn back time a short amount. When the Prince presents the dagger to his father, the traitorous Vizier demands it as payment, but is refused by King Sharaman. The Persians then continue on their journey to Azad with the wealth prisoners taken from the Maharajah, among them the Maharajah's beautiful daughter, Princess Farah. In Azad, the Vizier, now in the service of King Sharaman, tricks the Prince into using the Dagger to release the Sands of Time from the Hourglass. A horrific sandstorm engulfs the kingdom and the Sands of Time turn all the occupants of the palace into monsters. Only the Prince, Farah, and the Vizier remain unchanged due to their possessions; a dagger, a medallion, and a staff, respectively. Amid the catastrophe, the Vizier demands the dagger from the Prince, who refuses and manages to escape."", 'As they wait to die in the tomb Farah tells the Prince, who similarly reveals his claustrophobia, a story she had never told anyone before, about a time when she was little, when her mother told her about a secret magic word which would help her escape anything that scared her: ""Kakolukia"". As soon as the Prince repeats the word, as if by magic, the pair find a secret tunnel beneath one of the sarcophagi, which winds down into a mysterious, dreamlike bathhouse which resembles the magic fountains that the Prince earlier used to increase his health. As they bathe, the Prince and Farah finally make love and find comfort in each other amid their perilous situation. When the Prince awakens afterwards, he finds himself back in the tomb and discovers that Farah, the Dagger, and his sword are gone, leaving him with only Farah\'s medallion to protect him from the Sands of Time. The Prince, having found a new sword which destroys the sand monsters on contact, pursues and catches up to Farah once more atop the Tower of Dawn, which he must climb from the outside.

Feeling nostalgic? With Gran 4, you can even race on some of your old, favorite tracks from previous editions."", ""<b>LAN Play</b><br /> Compete against your buddies with the LAN play functionality of GT4.

Although the game features racing over all sorts of terrain, the majority of the action is set up and down high mountain slopes where plummeting temperatures ensure that there will be plenty, although varied levels of snow and ice. These conditions become more and more prominent as the game progresses and subsequent tracks take racers higher into the mountains. Yet as difficult and challenging as racing in these winter conditions is, the snow and ice is also designed to also be used to racer\'s advantage if they so choose. For example, the slopes above the game\'s 12 reversible tracks contain the capacity for sudden avalanches. These can be accidentally set off by the loud crash or explosions of vehicles, but can also be intentionally initiated by a well-timed horn. This means that a close competitor(s) that can\'t be shaken through driving skills alone can feasibly be buried in the snow with the blow of the horn. The caveat is that avalanches can also engulf the horn blower as well, so timing is everything. Ice bridges are another winter related feature that can be used to the racers\' advantage. As the tracks wind up the mountain at higher elevations these arches will become more prominent, but they are not necessarily as stable as they might appear. This means that larger vehicles can feasibly destroy them before competitors can cross them and their remnants can even come crashing down on racers from above. Racers coming off turbo bursts will also quickly learn that the snowbanks found throughout the game can be used, just like the waterfalls in earlier <i>MotorStorm</i> games, to cool off engines headed towards a boil over. Together these inhospitable environments make for some of the most fun and challenging races Stormers have ever faced. <p/> <b>The Vehicles</b><br/> Action in <i>MotorStorm: Arctic Edge</i> takes place across three different racing altitudes. This means a variety of terrain and thus a variety of vehicle classes. Players of previous games in the series will recognize the inclusion of most of the classes from those games, including Bikes, ATVs, Buggies, Rally Cars, and Pluggers, but with grip at a premium, two new vehicles have been introduced to combat the ice, the cold and the snow - the Snowcat and the Snow Machine. With ice, heavy snow and destructible bridges a real factor in the game one has the power and size to blast through packed snow, while the other has the grip and pace to combat most of what the subzero conditions can throw at it. Regardless of the vehicle chosen, players can personalize their rides in the livery by updating with a selection of various parts including wheels, exhaust, spoilers, and sponsorship stickers. <p/> <b>Multiplayer and Photo Modes</b><br/> Racing requires competition. With that in mind <i>MotorStorm: Arctic Edge</i> provides plenty of racing options. All race types, including the single player option, accommodate up to eight vehicles. This keeps the racing frantic, without slowing down the game\'s frame rate. Players can also take the action online competing against each other wirelessly via the Ad Hoc Mode on the PSP, or by using Infrastructure Mode to make it to the summit of the online global leaderboards. Racers can also immortalize the moments of their greatest triumphs and defeats by activating Photo Mode which allows you to snap and save the best action photos and send to friends online. <p/> <b>Create Your own Soundtracks</b><br/> Have a set of tunes that you want to race to? <i>MotorStorm: Arctic Edge</i> lets players take advantage of the PSP\'s expandable memory to add music from a memory stick and create a full list of customized tunes to inspire each race as they choose. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Frigid Alaskan Environments</b> - Tracks are modeled after the rugged Alaskan landscape featuring a unique blend of narrow mountain passes, giant ice caves, long ice bridges, and treacherous terrain. Players must battle through each race facing a number of weather conditions including snow, rain, and wind.</li> <li><b>New Vehicles</b> - In addition to the six vehicle classes from the previous <i>MotorStorm</i> games players gain access to new vehicles classes available specifically to tackle the Alaskan terrain including the nimble Snow Machine (snowmobile) and more forceful Snow Cat.</li> <li><b>New Tracks</b> - 12 available tracks that show off the unpredictable nature of the rough Alaskan setting. Each of the tracks will be accessible to race in reverse for added race variety.</li> <li><b>Multiplayer Racing Action</b> - Up to eight player online as well as ad hoc racing. Global leaderboards are available to show off the top ranked players in all game modes as well as single player Time Attack.</li> <li><b>Bobsleigh corners</b> - Vehicles power, slip, and spin through a variety of icy structures with only boost to provide control.</li> <li><b>Avalanches</b> - Snow-baked terrain brings the imminent hazard of avalanches, triggered by players sounding their horn.</li> <li><b>Collapsing Ice Bridges</b> - Travel over these in a heavy vehicle and risk the chance of it collapsing behind you.</li> <li><b>Customize Vehicles</b> - Players can personalize each vehicle in the livery by updating with a selection of various parts including wheels, exhaust, spoilers, and sponsorship stickers. Players can also create their own liveries from a set of base patterns and decals.</li> <li><b>Photo Mode</b> - Snap and save the best action photos and send to friends online.</li> <li><b>Artificial Intelligence</b> - A.I. analyzes the race and surroundings and reacts in the most realistic manner possible. Not only will the competition try to win the race at all costs, but the AI will react to situations realistically, such as locating the best routes and changing the level of driving aggression based on player actions.</li> <li><b>Attacking and Offensive Driving</b> - Players must not only try to win the race but survive against the other racers. Combat-like racing takes center stage as the vehicles are the weapons.</li> <li><b>Soundtrack</b> - Players will have the opportunity to add music from a memory stick to create a full list of customized tunes to inspire each race.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

You can slide under beds, hide in lockers, and even repel a zombie attack by forcing their head away from your neck with enough breathing room to raise your pistol and shoot them directly between the eyes. You'll even find strategy in the reloading of weapons. For instance, a box of shells takes more time to load than a clip. As annoying as it is to watch your character get munched because he couldn't load the rounds quick enough, I really like this aspect. It makes you keep an eye on every little detail."", ""Where Outbreak excels in engrossing multiplayer and creative gameplay, the overall design of the game is very odd. Rather than creating one lengthy quest that players can really sink their teeth into, Capcom opted to break up the game into five separate scenarios that are roughly 45 minutes each. If you die, you'll turn into a zombie for a brief extent (and yes, you can attack your teammates if you like), then will be dropped out of the game. Sadly, you can't re-spawn. You either have to wait for your friends to finish up, or find another game to enter. While scripted controller commands are offered, it doesn't support voice chat at all or keyboard functionality in-game.

For the love of all that is holy, I want to give this game a good score for its thoughtful level design, nice graphics, intense gameplay, and smart mission structure but that missing headset support throws the whole experience out of whack. These levels are fast-paced and frantic, almost like an FPS, and what you want is to make some sort of strategy. This just isn\'t possible with the canned commands available, as ""You two check out the locker room and we\'re going to search the owner\'s office. Meet back here and we\'ll go up to the 3rd floor,"" weirdly isn\'t mapped to the right analog stick. So, this game gets the backhanded compliment of being ""high concept"" like Crystal Chronicles and Steel Battalion, for example. My ideal setup is playing this game with four friends, four TVs, and four PS2s all in the same room. Get this setup, and the game is a real gem.<br /><br />Rated: <b>8 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Lisa Mason</b><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0"" /></a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

The camera and character variety are both suspect, and combos are nigh-impossible to break up. Fighters don't have nearly enough moves, either. On average, I found myself doing the same four-slash combo all the freaking time."", 'If you\'re one of those people with more than one friend, this is as good a way as any to get your brawl on with a PS2.<br /><br /><b>Concept:</b><br />Use your favorite Onimusha characters to unlock other Capcom heroes (and villians), and control them in a giant slugfest <br /><br /><b>Graphics:</b><br />Sharp, varied backgrounds and excellent models <br /><br /><b>Sound:</b><br />Umm, sword clangs and battle cries.

Applying the Onimusha license to gameplay that cannibalizes the Super Smash Bros. formula is equivocal to pouring Coke on your Wheaties. As asinine as Blade Warrior\'s concept is, you can\'t help but become completely entrenched in its simplistic, yet frantic hack n\' slash frays. Strategy laden multi-tiered environments, character-specific special moves, and four-player support pretty much round out the elements that Capcom has so blatantly stolen from Nintendo\'s popular series. Although very similar in design, Blade Warriors doesn\'t offer a robust selection of character types, nor reasons for people seeking a single player experience to invest more than a few hours of playing. Fun as it may be, it doesn\'t have the legs or chemistry of Super Smash Bros. <br /><br />Rated: <b>7.5 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Andrew Reiner</b><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0"" /></a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Transformers for PlayStation 2 now brings the heroic autobots and evil decepticons fully into the video game arena. This 3rd person, action-shooter lets you battle your way through stunning visual environments like the Amazon jungle and Mesoamerican temple to save planet Cybertron. Characters transform on the go and can collect minicons to gain special powers like additional weapons, shields, and the ability to fly.', '', 'As soon as Transformers fans see this score, the hate mail will begin. To them I say: ""Save it."" You guys will absolutely adore this game. So don\'t waste your time telling me how much I suck (I already know), and go play this game. You\'ll be glad you did. Those who aren\'t hopelessly devoted to this franchise, on the other hand, won\'t be quite as enamored. It\'s certainly not a bad game  in fact, I\'d say this could be the start of what is potentially a very good series  but it makes too many missteps to truly appeal to a wider audience.', ""But before I get into what this title does wrong, let's talk about what it does right. First off, the graphics simply rock. The stages are incredible to look at, and the Transformers themselves are just as impressive. The first stage, the Amazon, is one of the best-looking environments I've ever seen on the PS2, and the others are nearly as good. There are a few bland elements, such as the Decepticlones, but none of the visuals are at all bad. The look is great all around."", ""I also really likedwell, the graphics are the only thing I really liked. Having only three playable Autobots was a bummer, especially since I found no reason to play as anyone except Optimus Prime, as he felt the most balanced. The gameplay let me down in just about every way possible. Combat is repetitive and boring, the controls are goofy, and the rewards you earn simply aren't that rewarding."", ""In each stage, you'll face the same generic robots (who are actually pretty tough  even on the lowest difficulty level, this is a pretty hard game) in some very familiar third-person action. Run around, shoot the bad guys, and pick up the health power-ups they drop. It's standard stuff, and it would be second nature to play if the control scheme weren't so weird. It uses all four of the shoulder buttons, but the face buttons are virtually forgotten. Even on the last stage, I still hadn't completely adjusted to hitting L1 to jump."", ""Finally, the Mini-Con system, which is the basis of the entire game, also left a lot to be desired. As you progress through the stages, you'll discover Mini-Cons: little robots that can be equipped for additional powers. Only four can be equipped at one time, and they all have different power requirements, so your best (and most power-consuming) Mini-Cons can never all be equipped at the same time, and certain ones can only be used in particular slots. I would have liked to have had certain Mini-Cons grant permanent attribute bonuses; the enemies you face (especially the bosses) get tougher and tougher, and you really don't. Those that do increase your defenses typically have to be left behind in order to equip those that are essential to completing your mission."", 'Every time I started to enjoy Transformers, it did something to let me down. But I still have a lot of faith that it could grow into a great series. This title has plenty of flaws, but the main issue is that it\'s simply too typical and too clunky. By embracing what is so cool about the franchise, this series could really grow into something special. Consider this not a failed game, just a rocky start.<br /><br /><b>Concept:</b><br />Everyone\'s favorite shape-shifting robots are back in an adventure that ties into the recent Armada cartoon <br /><br /><b>Graphics:</b><br />The environments are amazing, and the character models are sharp and detailed <br /><br /><b>Sound:</b><br />Meh. Not even the once-cool transforming sound is that impressive here <br /><br /><b>Playability:</b><br />The wacky default control scheme cannot be remapped and is hard to get used to no matter how long you play <br /><br /><b>Entertainment:</b><br />The cool license isn\'t enough to overcome the so-so gameplay, making this one for fans only <br /><br /><b>Replay:</b><br />Low<br /><br />Rated: <b>7 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Jeremy Zoss</b><br />Issue: <b>June 2004</b><br /><br /><b>2nd Opinion:</b><br /> I had hoped that in my lifetime I would never have occasion to say ""Optimus Prime is a fragile pansy."" Unfortunately, I found myself repeating this phrase time and time again as he was blasted, punched, and hammer-thrown across all creation. Even without this inherent conceptual flaw, there are still some serious problems in the gameplay department that keep Transformers from reaching its potential. The controls are clunky, the objectives unclear, and the boss battles frustrating, making this nothing more than your average action title. However, I was amazed by how great the game looked the cutscenes in particular are gorgeous. Plus, the ability to transform at will between vehicle and robot form lends itself to some cool moments. Maybe I even whispered ""transform and roll out"" to myself once or twice. Maybe.<br /><br />Rated: <b>7 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Joe Juba</b><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0"" /></a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

I don\'t say that because I think it\'s an inferior sport or because I think that you have to be inherently devoid of brains to do some of the stupid, sick tricks they perform. I say this only because Rainbow Studios and THQ have teamed up to finally give the rest of us a motocross game that tries to update the sport. When I say ""us,"" I mean anybody who doesn\'t break limbs for a living on 250cc monsters tearing through the sky.</P> <P>MX Unleashed combines a lengthy career mode with Freestyle worlds whose layouts play more like a Tony Hawk game. This isn\'t a reinvention of the wheel by any means, it\'s just that its execution meant that I actually gave a damn about a motocross game for more than ten minutes. Run around in the environments and you\'ll encounter challenges like racing against a monster truck and other vehicles (which you then earn if you win), stunt competitions, and both Hit and Run activities. Runs are a series of jumps you have to perform in a row, while Hits are a series of runs that have to be done before competing riders finish theirs. Hits and Runs were my favorite Freestyle activities because you really had to nail your timing well and having to do all the jumps in succession was a cool challenge. A close second was earning the vehicles like the plane and buzzing around the worlds in those. This sounds stupid as hell, but I couldn\'t help smiling. One of the other small joys of Freestyle was the ambient life. Whether it was the riders or the trucks (with jumps on their flatbeds!), there was always something going on.</P> <P>Rainbow is mainly known as a developer with great physics, and here they don\'t disappoint. I can say that this is the first motocross game whose trick system didn\'t piss me off. I also like that you really have to think when you go out on the demanding courses. You can\'t just pre-load to the max all the time &#8211; you have to know the layout of the tracks and use your clutch and pre-load at varying strengths to keep your momentum out there. Finally, I should fault the game for having inconsistent collision, but it was just forgiving enough that it kept the fun rolling.</P> <P>Motocross has had an inglorious history of false starts, lots of franchises without enough distinction between them, and just mediocrity. This newest partnership is a good one, with the only problem being that it wasn\'t seized upon sooner. More straight-up innovation is needed next time, but until then, we\'ve got a good solid game on our hands.</P> <P>The Edge</P> <P>ive the edge without a doubt to the Xbox version. The graphics are simply crisper - something you instantly notice when flying 20 feet in the air with five other riders while your pulling off a Saran Wrap. Oh yeah, you\'ll also take note of it when the dirt particles fly as you eat it trying to land. The only disappointing note on this front is that the Xbox cannot get rid of the fogging problem in the Freestyle worlds. Other than that, I suggest you re-map the Thrill camera onto a trigger button. It sounds totally trivial - until you see yourself stylin\' high in teh sky, and then you can\'t stop using it.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Open up the motocross world with Tony Hawk-inspired Freestyle courses <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>There are some nice textures and dirt particles on the tracks, but too much fogging in Freestyle <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>The whining of the bikes is drowned out only by the smattering of small-time bands <BR><BR><B>Playability:</B><BR>The clutch will take some practice, but the trick controls are responsive <BR><BR><B>Entertainment:</B><BR>The game\'s structure is nothing new, but it\'s a good first step in getting the sport into everyone\'s hands <BR><BR><B>Replay:</B><BR>Moderately High <BR><BR>Rated: <B>8 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Matthew Kato</B><BR>Issue: <B>March 2004</B><BR><BR><B>2nd Opinion:</B><BR> I wouldn\'t be surprised if I was the first person in the history of video games to say that an MX title blew me away. As we all know, this genre has been running on two flat tires since its inception. With Rainbow Studios on the scene, this is all about to change. Offering a better understanding of vehicular physics than any other developer, Rainbow Studios has created the ultimate gameplay package. Squaring up turns, preloading jumps, stringing together trick combos, it\'s all here. While the silky smooth handling steals the show, this title also boasts great depth and ingenuity in its selection of modes. You\'ll even find yourself squaring off against a monster truck. You can\'t help but applaud the little things as well such as the ease of play from the first-person helmet cam. Even without online play, MX Unleashed soars high above the competition and is just as fun as Rainbow\'s previous works.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>8.5 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Andrew Reiner</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']",THQ,"['>#17,677 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#383 in Video Games > More Systems > Xbox']",$24.99,Video Games,B0000ZG4AA

Sure, <i>Super Metroid</i> on SNES took the concept and made it better, and <i>Metroid Fusion</i> was a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go.

The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended).

I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition.

My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original.

I can\'t even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let\'s just say that you\'re in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don\'t want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there\'s a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you\'ll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you\'ll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better.

Face difficult decisions every step of the way -- and decide to follow the path of the Light or Dark Side of The Force!', 'Video games and books such as the popular <i>New Jedi Order</i> series have continued the storyline of <i>Star Wars</i> past the events in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. According to this ""extended universe"", Imperial loyalists have been pushed back to a small number of worlds and are now known as the Imperial Remnant, and meanwhile Luke Skywalker has started a training academy to rebuild the once glorious Jedi Order. <i>Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</i> casts players in the ongoing <i>Star Wars</i> epic as Jaden Corr, a new character in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe who has enrolled at Luke\'s Jedi Academy. The Imperial Remnant and a group of dark-side Force users have been up to something shady, and it\'s your job as Jaden to uncover and stop their nefarious plans.', 'The game is a mix of first-person shooting and third-person lightsaber combat, with a heavy focus of the latter over the former. Players are allowed to customize the basic look of their character by choosing from a list of heads, torsos, and legs. Moreover, players can now customize the look of their lightsaber hilt in addition to the blade color, though all of these customizations are aesthetic only. Answering overwhelming fan demand, players now have the option of fighting with two lightsabers or the double lightsaber made famous by Darth Maul. The flashy new lightsaber combat styles are a lot of fun and make duels twice as entertaining. Players are able to use a set of Force powers such as Push, Pull, and Speed, that should be familiar to anyone who has watched the <i>Star Wars</i> movies. Ironically, players can learn and use Light Side and Dark Side powers like Heal or Lightning interchangably without any real restriction or consequence. The single-player story line is fairly thin but adequately does the job of giving you an excuse to visit a variety of diverse environments and cut through bad guys by the boatload.', ""The multi-player game features standard action game modes such as Free For All, Team Free For All, Capture the Flag, and Duel. Jedi Academy also features a couple of innovative multiplay experiences. Power Duel pits two slightly weaker players against one slightly stronger player. Siege is a team-based combat mode ala <i>Battlefield 1942</i>, but with a far older kind of Stormtrooper. Players assume the role of Scout, Demolitions, Soldier, Heavy Weapons, or Jedi, and use the strengths of their particular role to help their team accomplish the objective. Objectives typically involve breaching a wall or carrying an object from one place to another. Imagine a dynamic <i>Star Wars</i> battlefield complete with vehicles, <i>Star Wars</i> architecture, and small teams of Scouts, Jedi and Demolitions guys sneaking around while troopers and heavy weapons specialists blast everything in sight, and you've got an idea of Siege."", 'The game\'s only major flaw, if you can call it that, is the focus on lightsaber combat; those looking for a dedicated shooting experience may resent the reliance on these elegant weapons. If you\'re willing to play a Jedi simulator as a Jedi simulator, <i>Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</i> is a fun foray into the <i>Star Wars</i> universe that takes players beyond the familiar events of the classic trilogy. <i>- Jon ""Safety Monkey"" Grover</i>', '<b>Pros: </b>  <ul>  <li> New lightsabers and lightsaber moves are fun to play with <li> Multiplayer Siege mode is excellent <li> Force powers and <i>Star Wars</i> setting a refreshing break from standard FPS fare  </ul>  <b>Cons:</b>  <ul>  <li> Storyline is not terribly interesting <li> Lightsaber and character customization--while cool--have no effect on gameplay </ul>  <i>Note: this text refers to the Windows version.</i>']","by

And chapter three throws them all out the window in favor of taking the story full circle. </P> <P>Which brings us to the third part of the Onimusha trilogy, subtly titled Demon Siege. In the first of many switches from the franchise\'s usual MO, there are three playable characters &#8211; Jean Reno\'s Jaques, the first Onimusha\'s Samanosuke, and Parisian military woman Michelle. Each offers wildly different play mechanics, and this coupled with the game\'s time warp storyline (more on that later) offers needed variety to a survival horror franchise that was never really know for its fear factor.</P> <P>Each character will upgrade their weapons and skills through the course of the game (much less so for Michelle, as she\'s playable for far less of the game than the other two) in the usual fashion&nbsp;&#8211; collecting souls. Without a combo-laden combat system, Demon Siege relies heavily on timing and strategy to master each of the three warriors. This mechanic is very reminiscent of Enter the Matrix for two reasons: minimal button presses result in onscreen action that looks very, very cool. Two, the timing of action is far more crucial than combos. The difference is that Demon Siege is just a much better game &#8211; the enemies offer more variety, the control is more precise, and the elemental weaponry is extremely varied.</P> <P>While some action hardcores will likely fault the game for its simple control scheme, most will appreciate it for the satisfaction it brings to the screen. Kicking a demon away so you have better range with the Ball and Chain of Doom (my name for it, not the game\'s) is quite cool, after all. Just keep in mind that plot and combat play equal roles in the Onimusha universe, and each are doled out fairly. </P> <P>On the story side of things, Demon Siege has that dual time period hook. How well is the idea executed? Well, Paris really looks like Paris; and without being able to experience feudal Japan firsthand, all I can say is that it looks beautiful in the game. The plot unfolds at a lightning pace and requires players to use one character (in one time period) to do something, which has an effect on the other character (in the other time period). Switching frequently, the game\'s pace is so well crafted that there are few places that seem to be a pause &#8211; you\'ll always want to do that next thing.</P> <P>What I really like about this game is that I always felt like I was getting a new weapon, going to a new area, or fighting a new boss (most of which are ferociously tough, by the way). There was no drag for me. That, and kicking Genma butt made me look badass. Personally, I wouldn\'t want anything else for my favorite samurai/horror sendoff.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Craft a compelling, edge-of-your seat action game to conclude the Onimusha series <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>3D backgrounds don\'t mean that players have camera control, but it does mean that everything looks really grea <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>The score alternates between totally inspired and super cheesy &#8211; but it does fit the game <BR><BR><B>Playability:</B><BR>Timing is the key to success and I rarely felt robbed, so it did what it was supposed to <BR><BR><B>Entertainment:</B><BR>Demon Siege is one of the most cinematic games to date, and I soaked up every second gratefully <BR><BR><B>Replay:</B><BR>High <BR><BR>Rated: <B>9 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Lisa Mason</B><BR>Issue: <B>June 2004</B><BR><BR><B>2nd Opinion:</B><BR> The final chapter of the Onimusha trilogy radiates excitement and is the very definition of epic. The opening CG cinematic is so detailed and explosive that I wouldn\'t be surprised if George Lucas started handing out pink slips to the ILM crew. I know this clip is only a few minutes in length, but it is worth the price of admission alone. Further justifying that you absolutely need to add this title to your library, the gameplay is equally exquisite and is brimming with non-stop intensity. The methods with which you dispose of your assailants remain simplistic and true to the series. Plus, the battles are much larger in scope, the pacing of levels is relentless, and the visuals that you breathe in are all the more majestic. This truly is game development at its finest. While I would have liked to see more interaction in the environments, and depth in the combat, I really couldn\'t ask for a better conclusion to one of the PlayStation 2\'s finest series.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>9.25 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Andrew Reiner</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Drakengard tells the story of the soldier Caim as he fights to save his kidnapped sister from the clutches of the evil Empire. He cannot do it alone, however, so he joins his soul with that of a dragon to combine powers and set out on their way to defeat the enemy and solve the mysteries of the dragon. Mixing gameplay from such titles as Panzer Dragoon Saga, Dynasty Warriors, and Final Fantasy, the game allows its players to fight on the ground and in the air -- with full range of movement and over 60 weapons and attacks to exploit.', '<P>It\'s good to see RPG master Square Enix take a risk on a completely different type of game, and it\'s even better to see that its new title is &#8211; sort of &#8211; a success. Drakengard has been (with good cause) called ""Dynasty Warriors with dragons,"" and that basic concept has yielded interesting, yet flawed, results.</P> <P>Drakengard is the story of Caim (Kyme in the Japanese version), a Union soldier at war with the evil Empire (which fortunately has no Death Star or Sith Lords). In an effort to save his sister, the Goddess of the Seals, he is fatally wounded and must make a pact with a dragon to survive. As both Caim and the Dragon, the player takes on the nearly endless soldiers of the Empire.</P> <P>The quest features three different types of gameplay, which switch at fairly regular intervals. The first is melee combat, in which Caim slashes his way through simple, bloody ground combat. These stages are quite familiar to anyone who has played Koei\'s Dynasty Warrior games, and are incredibly simplistic. Combat solely involves one button, as does magic. This is hack n\' slash gameplay at its most basic. It\'s fun, but lacks any semblance of depth.</P> <P>The remaining two modes feature the dragon as the central figure. The first is aerial combat, in which the player flies around, breathing fire at anything that moves. These stages are short and simple, but get progressively harder as the story continues. The final, and most dynamic, mode is strafing, in which the dragon flies low over ground troops, raining flaming death down upon them. At any time, Caim can jump down off the dragon to engage in melee combat, which is often necessary to complete the stage. Certain enemies are immune to dragon fire, while others are hard to hit, thanks to the dragon\'s lack of agility.</P> <P>All three of the gameplay styles feature fairly detailed graphics, and the cutscenes are of classic Square quality. There could have been a few more enemy types, but the endless hordes of troops still look great. The pop up is pretty terrible, but considering the amount of figures onscreen at most times, it\'s more or less excusable. The framerate is also mostly constant, slowing during only a few instances of particularly frenzied air combat.</P> <P>Between the three modes, Drakengard stays fairly fresh, as the action always switches at the right moment. However, none of the three are really that new or exciting on its own. But combined with some sharp graphics and some rudimentary RPG elements, the gameplay offers up enough to recommend this title to fantasy buffs or Square Enix devotees. Yes, it\'s simple and not terribly original, but it does provide plenty of fast-paced action and some solid visuals.

Whether by blade or by your dragon\'s fiery breath, the blood of hundreds (perhaps thousands) will stain your hands in each mission that you enter. While I did find the hack n\' slash element to be satisfactory, this is by no means a solid-playing game. The mission objectives are annoying at best, and the dragon flying mechanics are horribly designed. If you thought Dynasty Warriors had a lot of pop-up, believe me when I say that you haven\'t seen anything yet. Even with sparsely detailed environments, enemy troops seemingly appear out of nowhere. Square usually excels in the graphical department, but Drakengard\'s visuals look like big, stinky dragon butt. I\'m a sucker for leveling up and gaining new powers, yet even with a healthy dose of these elements, I wanted nothing more than to permanently shelve this game. <BR><BR>Rated: <B>6 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Andrew Reiner</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Features an all-new graphics engine, weapon set and even more creative AI than ever before!', '<P>With a body count that doubles on each passing day, it was only a matter of time before Agent 47 cracked. In this third installment in the Hitman series, IO Interactive is inviting players to step into the mind of this ruthless contract killer and experience his mental anguish firsthand. Within the first few seconds the game, players bear witness to Agent 47 collapsing to the floor and losing consciousness. This spurs an interactive dream sequence set within a mental institution (which may seem familiar to those of you who played through the previous two titles). As Agent 47 fades in and out of consciousness, many of the stages that you will traverse represent a different memory in his tormented mind. Taking a stroll down memory lane, you\'ll perform the hits that shaped him into the hard-hearted killing machine that he is today. </P> <P>Invading Agent 47\'s brain is a clever idea that does help flesh out the character to a certain degree, but I had an incredibly difficult time following the plotline. As clichd as the previous two stories were, you couldn\'t help but fall in love with the events at hand. In this game, each passing second brought greater disinterest and a longing for the game to lose the artistic storytelling and get back to a hackneyed motion picture plot. </P> <P>The delivery of Agent 47\'s exploits is just the tip of the iceberg concerning material that doesn\'t sit well. Regarding gameplay, IO has made significant strides to open it up and grant players greater freedom of choice. No longer are you railroaded into using just one technique to perform a hit. You can usually find two or three methods that will work. While I did get a kick out of watching Agent 47 put someone down with a syringe to the neck or a pillow to the face, I mostly relied on running and gunning to clear out areas. The first-person element works much better this time around (although the gun graphics are still quite appalling), and your foes usually don\'t show the greatest of intelligence when they lay down an assault. You can usually lead them into a trap, and within seconds, have a pile of six or seven guards at your feet. Of course, the option to sneak through every stage undetected is still there, but you are rarely forced to duck out of sight.</P> <P>Without being coerced into using a specific technique, you just feel lost in Contracts\' massive levels. You\'ll often find yourself wandering aimlessly looking for the needle in the haystack that will complete the next objective. There really aren\'t any tense situations, calculated hits, or elements of surprise this time around.</P> <P>Making the gameplay less linear really threw a kink in the chemistry that worked so well in the first two games. All told, Contracts is an ambitious release for IO, but the end result is a garbled mess of a game that has lost its way.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Learn how Agent 47 became a contract killer through slightly confusing storytelling, and missions that are not nearly as taxing <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>The environment detailing and realism in the character models is outstanding, but the first-person gun graphics are downright appalling <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>The soundtrack and ambient noises are implemented brilliantly and add punch to the experience <BR><BR><B>Playability:</B><BR>Not nearly as demanding of skill.

However, it was a fairly linear adventure, forcing you to use a ton of trial-and-error and quick saving as you deliberately made your way through the levels laden with soon-to-be-deceased enemies. Hitman: Contracts seeks to give you more freedom, and in doing so largely loses what made the game compelling in the first place. In the opening level, you\'ll quickly learn that even if you blow your cover and alert the guards, it\'s easier to shoot your way out of a tight spot in the improved first-person view than it is to be stealthy. Also, given that it\'s hard to discern where you have to go to complete certain level goals, you often end up wandering around, randomly picking off enemies instead of plotting a devious course to success. In this sequel, Hitman feels less like a great stealth title than a mediocre shooter with a few cool gadgets and abilities.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>7.5 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Matt Helgeson</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Marketed as a portable Genesis, the Nomad was primarily an evolution of the Japanese market Mega Jet. Whereas the Mega Jet was screenless and required an AC adapter, the Nomad featured a 3.25 inch color LCD screen and room for six AA batteries, making it completely portable as opposed to simply being a small Genesis system. In addition to its other improvements over the Mega Jet, an A/V Out plug was added at the top of the unit, letting owners play games on a television screen with a separate A/V cable. One particularly interesting feature of the Nomad was its ability to allow one player to play using a connected TV, while another watched on the Nomad. The directional pad on the unit controlled all one-player games, and a port on the bottom allowed a second pad to be plugged in for two-player games. This meant that the Nomad could be a fully functional home system as well as a completely portable hand-held solution with a pre-existing library of games available for it.']","by

The Samurai Jack game, however, has none of the above. The conversion of Tarakovsky\'s two-dimensional characters to three dimensions makes for graphics that look familiar, yet still crappy. Where the show looks lush, the game looks bland. But the graphics aren\'t the only dull aspect of this title.</P> <P>As with the show, The Shadow of Aku follows Samurai Jack\'s quest to defeat the evil demon Aku by travelling back in time to thwart him before he can rise to power. Before he can head into the past, Jack has to free those Aku has enslaved. In each stage, Jack must seek out caged villagers and ancient relics to earn power-ups. Freeing villagers can earn Jack new swords, while relics can be exchanged for more life, power, or Zen (which allows Jack to enter ""sakai mode""&nbsp;&#8211; basically a simplified bullet time). The trouble is that none of these power-ups have any real effect on gameplay. The various swords all appear to dish out basically the same amount of damage.</P> <P>Like most licensed games, The Shadow of Aku is a collect-a-thon with simple combat, basic platforming, and little innovation. This isn\'t a truly bad game, just a very uninspired one. The various combat systems all work perfectly, they\'re just shallow and a bit counter-intuitive. The difficulty level is hilariously low; on the hardest setting, it\'s still a cakewalk, on the lowest, it can be easily completed by someone in a coma. Strangely, young kids don\'t seem to be this title\'s target audience, based on the Teen rating. Overall, The Shadow of Aku comes across as an amazingly generic action title. It\'s a shame, as Samurai Jack is easily one of the most unique cartoons on the air today, so this could have been so much more.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Take a Cartoon Network hero, dumb him down, and shove him in a generic third-person action title <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>The look is pretty faithful to the show, which sadly doesn\'t make for a good-looking game <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>The music, sound effects, and voiceovers are all pretty minimal and forgettable <BR><BR><B>Playability:</B><BR>The slightly bizarre control scheme works just fine, but it isn\'t exactly deep <BR><BR><B>Entertainment:</B><BR>Even Samurai Jack fans will find themselves yawning through this one <BR><BR><B>Replay:</B><BR> Low <BR><BR>Rated: <B>6 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Jeremy Zoss</B><BR>Issue: <B>May 2004</B><BR><BR><B>2nd Opinion:</B><BR> Every single one of the four points I\'m giving this game is for the animations seen in sakai mode. Sakai, apparently, makes time slow down and allows Jack to execute some really nice kung fu-inspired moves. But to be kind, the rest of Samurai Jack\'s latest outing is less than inspiring.

Built on arevolutionary new 3D graphics engine, Doom III draws you into the most frightening and gripping 3D gaming experience ever created. Dripping with atmosphere and changing the look of 3D games forever, Doom III features realistic physics, 6-channel surround-sound, and real-time dynamic lightingand shadows that create and environment of ever-changing fear and uncertainty. Compete in vicious multiplayer action where light, shadows, and a totally dynamic world can be used to your advantage or peril."", ""The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. Although <i>Doom 3</i> is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have."", ""<b>Hell on Mars</b><br /> Your character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need. <i>Doom 3</i> is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (remember <i>Half-Life</i>?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through."", '', '<b>Guns, Guns, Guns</b><br /> While there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.', ""One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us. <i>Doom 3</i> is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars."", '<b>Looking Good</b><br /> <i>Doom 3</i> looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested. <i>--Joshua Gunn</i>', '<b>Pros</b><br />', '']","by

Then the emergency siren! Then, the world as you knew it quickly evaporates into mayhem and evil.

You play as one of 10 different characters in your personal fight for survival. Play in areas like the school and an abandoned mine as you fight to stay alive and find the true cause of the evil forces around you. Horrifying sounds and visuals will get your heart pounding and everything can change in the blink of an eye.', '', 'The creepy tale of a possessed Japanese village (Hanuda) told through the eyes of ten playable characters in combination with some impressively innovative gameplayfeatures should totally make my day but playing Siren turns out to be sadly different than I was expecting.', ""The game's two big features: sightjacking (where you see through the eyes of other characters) and the Link Navigator (which manages the plot's order of events) sadly don't add to the player's experience enough to justify their problematic existence."", ""Sightjacking is more fun to mess around with than it is helpful to the player. Watching the paths of roaming enemies can offer useful information, but the stealth mechanic is so simplistic that the data is rarely necessary. In many situations, being seen by enemies is something that you can't avoid or recover from  they will find you, and they will kill you. This is fine by me, but when the only stealth-orientated skill that is offered is a painfully slow crawl (and a distracting yell, which had little to no effect that I could perceive), it doesn't make me want to be all that sneaky. There isn't a sound meter, no real way to know if enemies can see you or not (like a vision cone or shadow meter), and very little chance of distracting them with diversions. It is more fun and more efficient to just run through levels and see what happens than to use the sightjacking feature to suss out a plan of attack."", ""Which leads to discussion of the game's other big feature, the Link Navigator. Siren's storytelling plan sounds like a survival horror Real World season: Pick 10 characters to escape the apocalypse and find out what happens over 3 days through 78 missions  you could call it Siren: Hanuda. The complication is that the order of events is jumbled and the Link Navigator is supposed to help you keep track. What this means, from a player's point of view, is that the game's story doesn't really get its hook into you  not even in the first few hours. The tales are too disjointed, the characters too many, and the plot too slow in getting going."", ""The more conventional aspects of this game like sound design and graphics are also something that people will have mixed feelings about. The creatures' insane, maniacal laughs are honestly unnerving, and therefore good for this game. The graphics look to be actual pictures of the characters' faces and lend a realistic, but still skewed version of each person  they're detailed, but strangely flat. I think that this is a nice subtle touch, but others may disagree."", 'I really, really wanted to like Siren, but in the end, I just didn\'t have much fun or feel like the innovative parts of the game were used to their advantage.

Forming a mental bond with your attackers so that you see the surroundings from their perspective is a great idea that leads to some unnerving situations. This gimmick only goes so far, however. I found its functionality, and the entire gameplay package for that matter, to be clunky, and above all, frustrating. I grew so disenchanted with trying to pick up enemy sight that I avoided using this technique whenever I could.

The result is an incredibly deep gaming experience that you could easily pour dozens and dozens of hours into. The real disappointment is the alarmingly ancient-looking graphics. Just because the game is set in the Middle Ages, it doesn't mean the game needs to look like it was made back then as well.

Amid the slapstick jokes and anime innuendo, there is a moving portrayal of characters dealing with their own broken lives.', 'The majority of gameplay is spent on a rectangular grid of squares. Your success against the relentless enemies depends on myriad variables including elevation, character orientation, proximity of allies, and position on the field. The game is further deepened by the immensely sweet ability to make the enemies defect to your party. By purifying foes of their dark essence, they will reappear on your team once you defeat them. This means that you can slowly build up a party composed of all sorts of different little beasties to command. Perhaps the most complex strategy involves the purifying of dark portals, from whence enemies continuously emerge. By doing so, you send out a shockwave of elemental power that can damage enemies or heal allies. All of that combined makes for a game that is intensely difficult to survive, and nearly impossible to truly master.', 'Ultimaely, this title hits its big snag in the graphics department. What can I say? The animation is simplistic. Unmoving pictures thrown up on screen are somehow meant to pass for special effects. Detail is woefully lacking. The saving grace is the stylistic success of many of the hand-drawn images that permeate the landscape.', 'With that said, La Pucelle is an engrossing play that has the potential to kidnap you from family and friends for many a week.

Good news for everybody, then, that La Pucelle brings as much innovation and polish as its predecessor. This title\'s crowning achievement, though, is the learning curve. While it\'s easy (as far as strategy games go) to grasp the basics and get up and running on your quest, you could easily put a hundred hours into this title and still have things left to discover.

With a setting that Tom Clancy wouldn\'t mind endorsing, Republic Commando emerges as a great departure for Star Wars gaming, and a breath of fresh air that fans have been dreaming of since they first watched a squadron of storm troopers obliterate a hapless crew aboard the Tantive IV blockade&nbsp;runner. </P> <P>There are no backdoor drafts in the Republic. Born of the genetic stock of the galaxy\'s most feared bounty hunter, you were created with the specific intent of serving your people through bloodshed and war. Your appearance is identical to that of your brethren, who number in the millions, but your physical prowess has been heightened far beyond theirs. You are the best of the best. You are one of the Clone Trooper elite. Assigned as the leader of an upper echelon Republic Commando division, you must lead your squad to victory in the face of unyielding&nbsp;adversity.</P> <P>As you unload countless rounds into a Separatist onslaught, you can send your sharpshooter to a sniper point, tell your hacker to open a door, and order your weapons expert to light up the droid forces with a well a placed Thermal Detonator. The on-the-fly squad control may sound fairly complex, but the system that LucasArts has developed couldn\'t be easier to use. With this said, you won\'t have complete control over the actions of your cohorts. Outside of simple commands like ""form up"" and ""attack this target,"" you can only send them to areas that are assigned to specific tasks such as sniping or hacking &#8211; all with the click of a button. If you take on too much damage and go down, you can even signal to a teammate to revive you with a quick resuscitation. Thanks to impressive AI, you never really have to worry about your troops doing something stupid. The only flak you can send their way is for being too cowardly when an enemy is clearly not paying attention to them, and for not being able to recognize the greatest threat on the battlefield unless you point it out to them.</P> <P>Although the controls fit as comfortably as Master Chief\'s glove, the targeting system is too demanding of precision, especially when you are required to unload dozens of rounds into certain enemy types. If you don\'t have armor-breaking rounds, a Super Battle Droid can be just as annoying as the new dance number in Return of the Jedi.<B> </B>Airborne foes are also quite difficult to tag at a successful rate. </P> <P>While not a sure-fire marksman, Republic Commando still has enough kick in its firepower to knock you off of your feet. From explosive scripted events on the battlefield to harrowing battles that are almost too intense to comprehend, each mission is filled with relentless excitement and moments that you\'ll cherish for a lifetime. Whether you watch a Wookiee physically dismantle a Super Battle Droid or hold your breath as you rely on your troops to provide over a minute of cover fire as you hack a security terminal, Republic Commando seamlessly blends breathtaking spectacles with uniquely styled and highly contagious gameplay. The sound (sans the metal during the end credits) is remarkable as well.</P> <P>At the same time, however, you can\'t help but criticize the game for its limited number of enemy types (I seriously felt like I destroyed at least 10,000 Battle Droids), noticeably absent story breaks, and lackluster multiplayer deathmatching. Furthermore, why didn\'t LucasArts do online co-op? It\'s a perfect&nbsp;fit.</P> <P>It does tie into the upcoming Revenge of the Sith movie, but the Episode III content is more of a lightsaber tease than anything. General Grievous is literally in the game for two seconds, and just as you are about to join the pivotal battle of Kashyyyk, the game comes to an end, basically saying, ""This looks awesome, doesn\'t it? Buy a ticket to the movie and you\'ll see how it unfolds.""</P> <P>No lightsabers? No problem. A Star Wars game without Jedi may seem like a Jar Jar-sized disaster, but I don\'t think even Master Yoda could dodge a nicely placed sniper shot by this incredible Republic Commando unit.</P><BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Suit up as an elite commando and pulverize Battle Droids as you bark out orders to your Power Ranger-colored squad <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>There are few visuals more satisfying than the vibrant green splattering of Geonosian blood on your visor <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>Why do clones have different voices?

Painting Star Wars in a dark and gritty light results in visuals that are both believable and deeply involving. The action sprung to life around me, and the squad mechanic was one of the most enjoyable and flexible I have yet encountered, even if the ally AI was occasionally frustrating. With only a few different enemy types, there really should have been more variety in their tactics, which brings the otherwise gripping combat down a notch in my mind. The voicework and visceral Foley sound effects are uniformly fantastic, and the Episode III score had me chomping at the bit for the big May release. The ending induced in me near physical pain, as it brought me right to the brink of something I\'m not going to see until after the opening text scroll of the movie. Regardless, this is a unique take on that most beloved of fictional universes, and true fans would be remiss not to play it in its entirety. Oh, and in case you were wondering, Wookiees in battle are indeed ridiculously sweet.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>8.75 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Matt Miller</B><BR><BR><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Amazon.com</i>']","by

Though each character technically has particular strengths, the effect they have on actual gameplay is negligible  any character can use any weapon and drive any vehicle. Fortunately, there is a ton of each to experiment with, leading to some truly hilarious carnage. I especially loved flying around in a helicopter, lowering a winch to grab a passing civilian car, and then slinging it into enemy fortifications. Then again, it's hard to beat that warm feeling you get after brutalizing an international criminal and leaving him lying handcuffed and prone next to some C4."", 'Though I certainly enjoyed dinking around like this for a while, Mercenaries banks on the appeal of wholesale destruction rather than genuinely engaging gameplay. Though it is to be commended for trying to expand the standard ""cruise around doing missions"" experience, the things it adds don\'t really contribute much. For instance, though the concept of warring factions and fluctuating loyalties is cool, it is painfully weak in execution. If you work with the Chinese, you cheese off the Russian Mafia. However, if you bribe them, then everything is fine again. In other words, who you work for and who you blow up doesn\'t have any real repercussions; if you\'ve got cash, you\'ve got friends.', 'Much like the impressive and abundant explosions the game contains, whatever spark of interest Mercenaries may ignite quickly fizzles out due to lackluster mission objectives, flat story and characters (though Matthias, the Swedish merc, has some funny moments), and a generally derivative feel.

Full Spectrum Warrior was a game of robotic toy soldiers, and Mercenaries also lacks a soul as it plays the part of rebel without a cause. I had fun running and gunning with each double and triple cross, but at the end of the day, the title remained a flittering butterfly (albeit one packed with anti-tank missiles), with no one aspect really grabbing my imagination or lifting Mercenaries above being a collection of generic action missions. I will say this: Kudos to Pandemic for allowing enough wiggle room in the title\'s design to give you the freedom to complete jobs for all the competing sides without breaking the game. After all, you are a professional with a job to do, and Mercenaries makes it a fun day at the office.<br /><br />Rated: <b>7.75 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Matthew Kato</b><br /><br /><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" /></a><br /><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a>']","by

There are some nice touches however, including the ability to vastly customize your mechs, and a brand new Link System lets the player sync wanzers together so that you can unleash multiple attacks in a single round of combat.</P> <P>Overall, the game moves fairly slow and the combat is not nearly as deep as it could have been. Combine the mediocre gameplay with the sub-par graphics and campy story, and you can begin to see why Front Mission 4 is a bit of a disappointment.

Barring the intense opening cinema, the first three or so hours alternate between painful and lame. After that, FM 4 quickly becomes an engaging tactical RPG, though the graphics will never wow you and most everything that happens outside of combat is tedious and boring. Except for character development, that is&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;the new Link system adds an extra layer of strategy and keeps gameplay fresh.

The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before."", ""This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream."", ""To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better."", ""I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it."", ""Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games."", 'There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.', '']","by

He has turned to the life of a gladiator in hopes of saving the father and avenging the mother. It's heady stuff, and the friendship between these two is the main reason that players will want so desperately to be successful we'd really like to make them both heroes."", ""While Octavianus' covert portions of the gameplay mix work well enough, distracting the guards through whistles is never really a sure thing, and the level design doesn't really help to make these sections more compelling or rewarding. Most of the segments are a welcome relief from the intense action (more on that later), but lack the finesse shown in the combat portions. Climbing down from a box shouldn't require a hotspot-enabled action button press. Overall, they aren't bad or broken, but they do suffer from some dull spots."", ""While Octavianus is creeping around, Agrippa (a military muscleman) is recruited as a gladiator. This is where the game soundly earns its mature rating. You will beat men to death with their own arms, you will burst heads like ripe melons, and when you've caused enough spewing blood, you will cheer for the crowd and they will shower you with affection. And all of that is mighty fun not entirely because of the gore, but also because gladitorial combat is much more complicated than one would first guess. Simply beating enemies isn't the hardest part of a bout, appeasing the crowd and fueling their bloodlust is. With that in mind, Capcom developed the Salvo system, which rewards players and gauges the crowd's response by setting certain moves at a higher value. More often than not, it's much harder to entertain the morally bankrupt spectators than just survive."", ""While this is historically accurate, there are few games in memory that caused me such a moral dilemma. It's a blast, and the combat is a great balance between a wrestling and a fighting game, but I felt like a terrible human being. I guess that's the price you pay for being a gladiator."", '<br><br><B>Graphics:</B><br>Really sharp and nicely colorful  characters pop off of the screen', '<br><br><B>Sound:</B><br>The music is pretty subdued and I feel like it could have made more impact during the gladiator combat, but the voice acting is generally good', '<br><br><B>Playability:</B><br>Switching control schemes between gameplay types is done well, with each having their own quirks and strong points', '<br><br><B>Entertainment:</B><br>A blood-spewing good time, if you can bend your moral code a bit while you play', '<br><br><B>Replay:</B><br> Moderate <br><br>Rated: <B>8.5 out of 10</B><br>Editor: <B>Lisa Mason</B><br>Issue: <B>February 2005</B><br><br><B>2nd Opinion:</B><br> Beating foes with their own limbs to the crowd\'s roar made every demented cell in my body scream with joy. But man cannot live on death alone, and Shadow\'s stealth is fun in its own right. However, killing the weak and stealing from the dead in battle is your true love. The fact that weapons break makes you constantly adjust your playing style. The phrase: ""Don\'t make me break a sword off on your ass"" was coined in Rome many years ago. I would like depth through character upgrades and a better targeting system, but then again you are just a gladiator  you will kill on command and you will like it.<br><br>Rated: <B>8.5 out of 10</B><br>Editor: <B>Matthew Kato</B><br><br><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif""></a><br><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a>']","by
