At first glance, you might mistakenly believe Blue Dragon Plus to be a strategy game in the style of Final Fantasy Tactics, with little hand-drawn heroes and monsters arranged on an isometric 3D stage. But once the fight begins, everything starts happening in real time and you must feverishly put together your plan of attack, because those enemies aren't waiting for your turn. You command your units around the field with quick but simple controls that rely totally on the touch screen. You tell your units where to go, who to fight, when to heal, and when to move to special areas on the map. It seems like your attention is constantly needed everywhere at once, but the game gives you some room for error by providing a high number of healing items. Also, as you progress through each map, the game occasionally pauses to let some part of the story play out. The game will feature a thirty-hour quest as well as the ability to control up to sixteen humans and Mecha Robos in real-time battles and shadow fights. Every mission scored for kills and mission success   Win rank and medals in your quest to be the World's Greatest Fighter Pilot (WGFP)   Unlock Bonus missions with successful mission accomplishments; new bonus missions downloadable every 120 days   Solo single player game can also be used as a gateway to world famous combat massively multiplayer online game, WarBirds; free month of online play with purchase of single player game""]","by

As the Don of a family, there are a ton of strategic choices to make in <i>The Godfather 2</i>. Just one example are Monopolies. Monopolies are groupings of rackets that ""run"" the same criminal activity. Controlling, and defending a monopoly comes with both a monetary bonus and game perk benefits making them key to owning the map, gaining wealth and amassing power. Monopolies can be local to one city or span across the cities. Larger monopolies made up of many targets, spanning multiple cities are obviously more difficult but offer greater rewards. Other in-game rackets include: Fronts - extortable legitimate businesses of the game that provide payouts as well as money laundering opportunities; and Small, Medium and Large Rackets - venues containing an illegal criminal activity and usually disguised as legitimate businesses.

You start out at Slappy's, and while there are some tutorials, veterans will be able to blaze through them in about a minute. New players, on the other hand, will find Slappy's park to be inviting and easily accessible, and can get a taste of what's in store for them before taking on the entirety of San Vanelona. And once out there, you'll find that people you run into remember you and what you did five years ago, and are excited to see you back in action."", '<b>Exciting New Features and Capabilities</b><br> While the controls will be instantly familiar to fans of the previous game, there are loads of new tricks to perform. Skaters can now do footplants, crail slides and fingerflips. Or show off with a lip trick, an Ollie North, and the long-sought ability to Skitch (grabbing the bumper of a moving car) to gain speed.', ""New to Skate 2 is the ability to get off your board and walk around. While on foot, players can move certain objects in the world, creating their own lines with nearly 100 different objects. Changes to the environment, big or small, will stay put in the game regardless of how long you play. Should you decide that you no longer like your giant stack of trash bins or some other madness you've set up, one touch of a button can return the items to their original position.

And speaking of crashes, skaters will now experience, and be able to highlight, damage to their threads. Clothes get dirty and become torn, and players get cuts and bruises depending on their actions. And if you crash big enough, you'll see a bail score pop up and increase as you take damage, culminating in the Thrasher Hall of Meat screen that tells you how well you've done crashing, and gives you an x-ray view showing your broken bones."", 'Skate 2 also features the choice of creating either a male or female character, rather than just male, and will offer an in-depth graphics creator.

Divided into an ""attack"" segment and a ""defend"" segment, battle centers around timing, harmonics, and synchronization between your Reyvateils. As you advance in the game, the things you learn and enemies you conquer add additional capabilities to your arsenal. Pairings between characters that have created strong individual bonds put even more power at your disposal, bringing the events that occur in between struggles into the fray and adding strategic interest.', '<b>Object Crafting and the Cosmosphere</b><br> Between battles, you\'ll stay busy interacting with shop keepers, moving around the region, exploring the maidens\' object crafting capabilities, and ""Diving"" into psychological realms, where you can explore a Reyvateil\'s ""Cosmosphere,"" uncovering her emotions and spiritual power. Unlike in the previous version, interactions in the Cosmosphere have effects in the real world. You can even date other characters, impacting the evolving social networks of Metafalss. The intricate conversations that occur, the wide range of character interactions, and the unique magic behind the harmonics of song battle give this game a rich, innovative texture.', '<br clear=""all"">']","by

This means that although at the beginning of the game players will find themselves presented with the familiar opportunity of starting a farm, selling their crops at market and by doing so improving the overall prosperity and size of their town, they are not necessarily tied to the land. Although farming is an excellent way to finance adventuring, the rich RPG elements of the game can be pursued at any time. These elements present themselves mostly in the form of battling monsters and bosses that have found their way into the land, but seem to be coming from the mysterious \'Whale Island,\' which floats in the sky above your town. Players can either battle the monsters or make friends with them, raising them as a kind of livestock. As with everything in <i>Rune Factory: Frontier</i>, the choice is yours. Whether it\'s growing crops, expanding the town, fighting (or befriending) monsters or even falling in love, the experience is unique to each player. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Lifelike Interactions</b> - NPCs will come and go based on the player&rsquo;s actions. Want to get along with your neighbor? Want to give fellow townsfolk something they might hate? Go ahead, but they may get upset and leave the town. Be nice to attract more newcomers.</li> <li><b>Natural Ecosystem</b> - Breathe life into the barren wilderness by cultivating it and planting crops. Small creatures (spirits) will gather first, triggering a food chain to later attract larger and rarer creatures. You are responsible for bringing more fertility to the land.</li> <li><b>Floating Island to Explore</b> - There is an island that floats in the skies. When you see it, you must quickly find a way to get on it as new discoveries await.</li> <li><b>Intuitive Wii Controls</b> - Use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to do everything. Plow the land, shake hands with townsfolk to strengthen relationships, or even wave it around when you&rsquo;re on a date with a girl. (Also compatible with the Classic Controller.)</li> <li><b>Open-ended Play Structure</b> - Whether you prefer Life Sim gaming, Action RPG action or a mix of both, <i>Rune Factory: Frontier</i> lets you game as you want, when you want.</li> <li><b>Console Debut</b> - <i>Frontier</i> is the console debut of the popular <i>Rune Factory</i> series.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <p/>']","by

You stand high atop a tower looking down upon a world consumed by flames. An old man beside you opens his mouth and speaks: <blockquote>&ldquo;Time has expired for this world, but the records of this book shall create the next...&rdquo;</blockquote> <p/> Suddenly your eyes snap open and you jump out of bed, covered in sweat, but not necessarily surprised. It was only a dream, but unfortunately an all too familiar and frightening dream that you&rsquo;ve been having quite often lately. Dazed, your sleep-filled eyes wander about the room as they always do when you wake, but something is different this time. There is a book atop the desk, a book full of blank pages. But this no empty tome. It seems that a spirit of sorts named ""Rempo"" is bound to this book and as you are drawn closer it enlightens you on the nature of the book you behold. It is known as the ""Book of Prophecy"" and upon the insistence of the spirit, you leave on a journey to to fill its pages and in the process make an impact on the world, the likes of which you never could have foreseen. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> The connection between your dream as the main character and the book you are shown by Rempo is that the world has been slated for destruction, but only temporarily. The powers that be intend to recreate what they destroy, but require a blueprint for this, which is the purpose of the book. It is your job to seek out all the things that are to be recreated and note them in the book. But nothing is so straightforward in an RPG. There are forces in the world that would keep you from your appointed task. You must foil them by using the book itself. <p/> Although the Book of Prophecy does serve as a storage device, it is much more than that. It is player\'s main tool, having a part in almost every aspect of the game. It takes a comprehensive snapshot of whatever it comes in contact with. This can be things as different and disconnected as a blade of grass and a sword. But as this is happens players will see that nothing is quite what it appears. All items are made up of a collection of attributes, many of which go unnoticed in their natural state. Once broken done into their separate pieces and laid out in the book, not unlike LEGO in the hands of a child or genes under the microscope of a scientist, these can recombined as the player sees fit to alter the strengths and weakness of enemies, solve puzzles, etc. Another added gameplay element that players will enjoy relates to the gender of the playable hero/heroine they choose. Although the beginning scenarios faced by either will be very similar, their end points may be quite different, allowing for hours of extra game time and replayability. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Top-Level Development Talent</b> - The experienced Nintendo DS development team behind the <i>Final Fantasy III</i> and <i>Final Fantasy IV</i> remakes, Matrix Software, is at the helm together with the creative minds behind the <i>Harvest Moon</i> and <i>Rune Factory</i> series.</li> <li><b>Alter the Game World to Your Advantage</b> - By collecting information on the various monsters, inhabitants, plant and locations found in the game world and filling out the pages of the mysterious Book of Prophecy, players can influence a myriad of parameters, from monster attributes to weapon strength. </li> <li><b>Enticing Graphics and Game Play</b> - Highly detailed characters, landscapes and monsters fuel the addictive nature of capturing different monsters to complete the book&rsquo;s collection.</li> <li><b>Immersive Story</b> - Players can lose themselves in the game&rsquo;s grand, sweeping storyline.

You are a Grey Warden, one of the last of an ancient order of guardians who have defended the lands on the continent of Thedas throughout the centuries. Betrayed by a trusted general in a critical battle, you must hunt down the traitor and bring him to justice. As you fight your way towards the final confrontation with an evil nemesis, you will face monstrous foes and engage in epic quests to unite the disparate peoples of a world at war. A romance with a seductive shapeshifter may hold the key to victory, or she may be a dangerous diversion from the heart of your mission. To be a leader, you must make ruthless decisions and be willing to sacrifice your friends and loved ones for the greater good. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i> is a 3D oriented RPG based in a dark, heroic, fantasy realm where moral choices have a lasting impression on the people you meet, the members of your own party and the world around you. The inclusion of subtitle ""Origins"" in the game\'s title refers to the six unique origin stories available to new heroes as a new game begins. Each of these has an impact on the player\'s motivations and his or her experience, and renders a unique prelude, path, and possible ending(s) to the game. There are many different endings to the game based on the origin story of the character and the choices you make as you play through the game. The game features three character classes--warrior, mage, and rogue--and three races of being--Human, Elf or Dwarf--that can assume these classes. Although most game elements, such as weapons, magic, etc., are available to any character, each class and race has different strengths, abilities and affinities which lend themselves to better utilizing different elements. <p/> <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i> is a single player game based on party-based gameplay and combat where the player can join, control and quest with up to three non-player characters (NPCs). Players can also quest alone if they so choose, but with the chance of survival are slim. Convincing NPCs to join you, and treating them well may be necessary depending on the varying sentiments between the player and the NPC, or between the NPC\'s in the party based on the chosen history written into the origin story accepted at the beginning of the game. This uncertainty allows for a variety of possible dynamics within the party ranging from open hostility, all the way to romance. The game progresses in real-time via a pause-and-play tactical combat system that allows the player to check inventory levels, equip a character, etc. in a slight vacuum. Additional features found in the game include: a combination of a standard loot system and a currency system based on gold silver and copper; advanced character customization functionality; the use of poison, traps and herbalism; dual-wielding skills; and ""spell combos,"" which allow players to chain together different spells to create a unique effects. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>BioWare&rsquo;s deepest universe to date with over 80 hours of gameplay and more than double the size and scope of <i>Mass Effect</i>. <ul> <li>Travel throughout dozens of environments and fully immerse yourself in a shattered world that is on the brink of utter annihilation.</li> <li>An epic story that is completely shaped and reactive to your play style.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Complex moral dilemmas offering no easy choices. <ul> <li>Tailor your <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i> experience from the very beginning by choose from six different origin stories.</li> <li>Decide how to handle complex issues like murder, genocide, betrayal, and the possession/sacrificing of children without the security of a good/bad slider to tell you what to do.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Full character customization allowing the player to sculpt a hero in your own image or fantasy. <ul> <li>Elaborate character creator allows you to create your own hero unique from anyone else.</li> <li>Shape your character&rsquo;s personality and morality based on the choices you make throughout the game.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Engage in bone-crushing, visceral combat engaging in battle against massive and terrifying creatures. <ul> <li>Unleash legendary powers and choose from over 100 different magical spells and skills.</li> <li>Experience the adrenaline rush of brutal combat, beheading your foes or casting spells that make enemies explode from within.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

This mysterious power forms the beginning of all life, is the source of all magic and the origin of all thought. For eons the angelic Seraphim watched over the T-Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. But eventually tiring of their burden, they passed their knowledge on to the High Elves. T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it? <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br /> Gameplay in <i>Sacred 2: Fallen Angel</i> in divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark.

But the time travel mission goes awry, creating an alternate timeline where technology has followed an entirely different evolution, a new superpower has been thrust on to the world stage, and World War III is raging. The Empire of the Rising Sun has risen in the East, making World War III a three-way struggle between the Soviets, the Allies, and the Empire with armies fielding powerful over-the-top weapons and technologies like tesla coils, Kirov war blimps, massive samurai robots, armored bears, dolphins with sonic weapons, floating island fortresses, and transforming tanks. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> In true <i>Command & Conquer</i> form, action in <i>Red Alert 3 Ultimate Edition</i> is based on classic RTS gameplay. Through this players align themselves with either the Allies, the Soviets or the Empire of the Rising Sun, and proceed to establish bases, manage collected resources from controlled territories and escalate technology acquisition in order to eventually eliminate battlefield rivals. Throughout the game players will utilize the franchises familiar mechanism of churning out an array of buildings, units and vehicles to facilitate this, but will also be faced with a series of new variables. Some of these will come in the form of new, powerful units like the Empire of the Rising Sun\'s Shogun Executioner, a giant mech wielding energy blades, the armored attack bears of the Soviets and the sonic attack of the Allies\' dolphin ship, but there is also a change to the game\'s terrain to consider. Now in addition to battle on, and over land, players also have to be aware of the realities of naval warfare, as combat is extended to the waters on their borders. <p/> Another aspect of RTS gameplay that <i>Red Alert 3 Ultimate Edition</i> address is the need for superior control functionality. Too often when a PC RTS game makes the leap to gaming consoles, shedding keyboard and mouse functionality, players experience a reduced ability to respond quickly to attacks via unit production and/or changes to production. This is not the case in <i>Red Alert 3 Ultimate Edition</i>. Through its radial command menu, which utilizes the DualShock 3\'s analog stick and the \'X\' button, players can execute commands with three button presses or less and can queue up production of units to occur as resources are gathered to supply them. In addition, commands to existing units on the battlefield and your commanders are easily facilitated by controller shortcuts, such as a single face buttons to select/deselect all on screen units and another to direct their movements, providing a fast way to make immediate field commands.<p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b><i>Ultimate Red Alert 3</i> Experience</b> - Bloopers &amp; outtakes, behind the scenes, developer strategy videos, and new battleground maps not found anywhere else.

Eighteen months later only one ship remained and 18 passengers survived. Marco Polo never revealed what happened to these lost ships. Embarking on a quest to find the lost fleet, fortune hunter Nathan Drake soon realizes Marco Polo was hiding a much bigger secret - he had gone on a secret expedition to find the mythical kingdom of Shambhala and to recover the legendary Cintamani Stone, the ""Wish-fulfilling jewel"" of Buddhist mythology. With this new information Drake settles on a new course, following Marco Polo\'s trail through a diverse range of exotic environments. This quest also pits him against a new, more formidable adversary - a ruthless, rogue paramilitary leader with a private army and a relentless ambition to recover the stone for himself. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Although gameplay in <i>Among Thieves</i> is similar to that of the previous game, there are several major differences. The most important of these is the addition of several online multiplayer options. Unfortunately, no offline multiplayer could be included in the game due to the impact local split-screening has on the game\'s graphical quality. Thankfully though, the online modes included cover both co-op and competitive play. See the feature list below for details on these. In addition to play modes players can also expect a wealth of new gameplay features including a new stealth gameplay mechanic and altered climbing mechanic--both of which are extended to the AI of enemies; the ability to create cover by flipping over certain found items; the use of riot shields for defense and offense; and a complete lack of loading screens. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Powered by Naughty Dog&rsquo;s new 2.0 Engine Technology.</li> <li>Open layout allows players to take an aggressive or stealth approach to combat.</li> <li>Free-flowing ""traversal gunplay"" adds a unique vertical element to standard 3rd-person shooting mechanics.</li> <li>Award-winning cinematic story presentation.</li> <li>A Deep Single Player Campaign <ul> <li>An expanded cast of characters who reflect different facets of Drake&rsquo;s character, including Chloe Frazer, Drake&rsquo;s current partner and new romantic interest.</li> <li>Varied and exotic locations &ndash; from lush, green swamps and dense urban environments, all the way to the ice and snow of the Himalayas.</li> <li>Unrestricted combat allows you to take an aggressive or stealthy approach to combat.</li> <ul> <li>Free-flowing ""traversal gunplay"" adds a unique vertical element to familiar cover-based third-person shooting mechanics, allowing you to engage in combat from any position in the environment &ndash; even while climbing and hanging.</li> <li>Introduction of new traversal and free-climbing mechanics allow Drake to navigate through the environments more fluidly and naturally.</li> <li>Gunplay and combat enhancements, including an expanded melee system, and a variety of enemy types with advanced AI routines.

Although living in occupied WWII Paris, Sean is initially concerned only with the racing lifestyle and his friends within it. That all changes though when the Nazis kill his friends, and change his life forever. Seeking personal retribution on a Nazi officer and others involved, Sean\'s life soon becomes dominated by a need for payback, which is exacted with the help of the French Resistance, British intelligence, an arsenal of weaponry, and your own street smarts and brawn. Motivated by retribution and armed with tactics of sabotage you are a one man wrecking crew, blowing up zeppelins, derailing trains, imploding bridges, destroying armored tanks, and leveling enemy facilities in the name of vengeance. <p/> <b>Open-world Gameplay</b><br/> <i>The Saboteur</i> in the first open-world, action game set in Nazi-occupied Europe, and combines a variety of different kinds of gameplay, including third-person shooter, stealth and racing. As in other open-world games, this means that although players will be tasked with completing an extensive list of set missions against Nazi units and individuals, they will also have the freedom to explore and fight throughout the game world as they choose. This world although set in Paris also encompasses the French countryside, as well as parts of Germany. Within it players will be able to use representations of actual landmarks &#151; for example, the Eiffel Tower &#151; for navigation, and a variety of vehicles for transportation and combat. In mission play, with each success players move closer to tracking down the particular Nazis responsible for the death of Sean\'s friends by putting the rewards that they receive for success to work on the black-market. They can trade for all sorts of items to help their progress, from weapons, to cars, maps and more. These all can also either be found throughout the game, or taken from defeated opponents, although the more commotion that is created and the higher the skills of the player, the greater the enemy response will be. <p/> <b>The ""Will to Fight"" System</b><br/> Although built around Sean\'s desire for personal revenge, <i>The Saboteur</i> also contains a play mechanism through which the lives of the non-player characters (NPCs) are improved, and can even be manipulated. This is the ""Will to Fight"" system. Long known as the ""City of Light,"" Paris as depicted in the game under Nazi occupation is a place dominated by stark black and white colors. These colors reflect the hopelessness of the people. But as the player collects victories against the invaders, a change will begin to be seen in the physical environments of the game, again reflecting the mood of the people. Where once there were only stark black and white colors and few civilians on the street, now players will see increasingly bright colors, reflecting the hope of the civilians and eventually incite an underground resistance among the Parisians to take up arms on their own, and even come to your aid when the odds are stacked against you. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Explore Open-World Paris</b> - Climb the Eiffel Tour, snipe from Notre Dame Cathedral, and brawl on the Champs d&rsquo;Elysee as you sabotage your enemies. Fight, climb, and prowl through the dark alleys, rooftops, burlesque houses, and seedy streets of the City of Lights&mdash;the ultimate playground for <i>The Saboteur</i>.</li> <li><b>Be the Saboteur</b> - Use a broad range of weapons and explosives to perform your blockbuster sabotage as you single-handedly hunt-down your enemies to dismantle and destroy the Nazi occupation.</li> <li><b>Stealth Gameplay</b> - Use gameplay systems like Climbing, Sneaking, and Stealth Kills to infiltrate the Nazi occupation to perform acts of sabotage Once you\'ve blown your target to pieces, leverage the intuitive cover system and assortment of weapons to blast your way to freedom.</li> <li><b>Vertical World</b> - This version of Paris was designed to leverage the unique abilities of <i>The Saboteur</i>. Being a saboteur is all about surprise attacks and Paris\' rooftops are the perfect path for your secret operations.</li> <li><b>The ""Will to Fight"" System</b> - <i>The Saboteur</i> introduces a innovative new feature that is both an iconic visual style, and a compelling gameplay element. See and feel Paris change around you as you progress through the game. Go from a dark and oppressed black and white policed state, to a bright and inspired world where the citizens fight back.</li> <li><b>Jack Your Ride</b> - From high performance race cars to military vehicles, as <i>The Saboteur</i>, you can drive any vehicle that comes along to escape your pursuers.</li> </ul> <h4>System Requirements:</h4> <table border=1 cellpadding=""3""> <tr> <td width=""10%""></td> <td align=center width=""90%""> <b>Minimum</b></td> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""10%"">OS:</td> <td align=center width=""90%"">Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista SP1, Windows 7</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""10%"">Processor:</td> <td align=center width=""90%"">2.4GHz Core2Duo, 3.0 GHz Pentium D or better</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=""10%"">RAM:</td> <td align=center width=""90%"">2GB or more</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=""10%"">Disc Drive:</td> <td colspan=2 align=center width=""90%"">2x or faster DVD-ROM drive</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""10%"">Hard Drive:</td> <td colspan=""2"" align=center width=""90%"">At least 7.5GB of free space</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""10%"">Video Card:</td> <td align=center width=""90%"">DirectX 9.0c compatible video card (card must be 256MB or more and contain one of these chipsets: NVIDIA Geforce 7800 GTX, ATI Radeon X2600 XT, or better)</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""10%"">Sound Card:</td> <td align=center width=""90%"">DirectX 9.0c compatible</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""10%"" height=""26"">Input Device:</td> <td td colspan=""2"" align=center width=""90%"">Mouse, keyboard or game pad</td> </tr> </table> <td> <tr> </table>']","by

T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike.

Summoned by urgent order, the player in the form of the lowly Prinny rushes to meet his boss, Demon Lord Etna in her chamber. You arrive just in time to see Etna beating your fellow prinnies to a pulp. She is definitely in a bad mood, being even more abusive and violent than usual. As it turns out, someone has snatched her favorite dessert from the fridge. Eager to vent her frustration, she orders you to hunt down the ingredients to create a new Ultra Dessert and promises that if you do not deliver the goods by the next morning that you will learn what eternal suffering really means. Since you are at the very bottom of the netherworld food chain, if not its gutter, you have no choice but to snap into action. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Prinny</i> is a side-scrolling platformer filled with classic flavored gameplay that requires timing of jumps and memorization of the patterns of enemy movements. As non-threatening as dessert making might seem, nothing could be further from the truth. In the game players are given 10 hours and the use of 999 identical comrades from the Prinny Squad to defeat demon bosses spread throughout the game\'s levels who possess the necessary ingredients to create a new dessert for Etna. Although this may sound like way more than enough help, surprisingly challenging gameplay that consistently has players one blow from either victory or defeat and the nature of the prinnies themselves will quickly change player\'s perception on this. <p/> True to their origins in the <i>Disgaea</i> universe where their literal explosive nature makes them perfect cannon fodder to aim at enemies, prinnies are extremely volatile. Players can only only control one prinny at a time because you only possess one red scarf, which not only indicates your status as current game hero, but also keeps you from blowing up. Wave after wave of enemies within the game also conspire to exploit the prinnies\' tendency towards combustion, and more often than not are successful, underlining the importance of your 999 friends. This means that players do not actually play as a single prinny. As one meets his end another takes his place and you are kept informed of how many prinnies you have left, as well as how many hours. Prinnies are not defenseless though. Players have use of a variety of attacks and moves like the \'Dual Sword Slash\' to deal with enemies in front of you, the \'Hip Pound\' which allows you to stun opponents with your bottom and standard platformer jump and sprint functionality for mobility. In addition, prinnies can lift and throw objects like bombs, stomp enemies and even pilot tanks and planes to bombard whatever gets in your way. The game comes with two modes: Standard Mode, which allows you to take damage up to 3 times before losing a life and Hell Mode where one blow means instant death. In this ridiculously comic adventure you will need every advantage if you hope to survive the cost of the ultimate sweet treat. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>1,000 Units</b> - Players will get 1000 lives to beat the toughest action of this platforming side-scroller.</li> <li><b>Lift &amp; Throw</b> - Prinnies are able to lift and throw objects on the battlefield.</li> <li><b>Vehicles</b> - Steal and control powerful vehicles, like tanks and UFOs.</li> <li><b>Hip Pound</b>: Jump and pound enemies to stun them. Then you can inflict multiple combo attacks for extra damage.</li> <li><b>3D World with 2D Characters</b>: In <i>Prinny</i>, character art is created using fluid 2D sprites, giving it a classic look with a comical tone. Battlefields and backgrounds, however, are created with 3D models. This allows for a smooth and unique combat action where certain attacks are rendered in a 3-dimensional view.</li> <li><b>Boss Battles Galore</b> - 10 Major stages featuring many hidden characters and a boss waiting at the end of each.</li> <li><b>Music Collection Mode</b> - Find music tracks during game and replay them as background music.</li> <li><b>Humor</b> - Ridiculously comedic storyline and characters.</li> </ul> <br/><br/><br/><br/>']","by

Confirming that the Titans are developing new Gundam Mk II mobile suits, Quattro and his comrades capture some of the machines and then return to the AEUG flagship, Argama. They are accompanied by a young civilian named Kamille Bidan, a talented pilot with strong newtype potential and no love for the Titans. Evading the pursuing Titans and their allies in the regular Federation Forces, the Argama makes its way to the moon, where the rebels receive new weapons and supplies from their sponsors. After capturing several Federation warships, the AEUG gathers its forces for its first major offensive - a massive mobile suit attack on the Titans\' terrestrial supply base, the underground fortress of Jaburo in South America. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2</i>, like its predecessor, is a hack and slash tactical action game based on several different anime within the popular and long-lived <i>Gundam</i> series. Action in these anime, and thus within <i>Gundam 2</i>, is based around combat that utilizes in-game mechanized mobile suits and the player\'s ability to pilot them in combat against hordes of similarly equipped enemies. The goal in this combat is to level up your chosen character and suit by doing enough damage against the low level enemies you face, and wherever possible, the huge boss character/mechs that are associated with the particular level you find yourself on. Gundam mobile suits feature laser swords, guns, as well as propulsion mechanisms, together which can be used in a few varieties of standard and charging attacks, as well as attacks designed to knock out all enemies within a certain range by charging a power gauge before acting. As you would expect, successful attacks against bosses require much more work and precision, and in many cases rapid input of button prompts flashed during combat. <p/> <b>Multiple Play Modes</b><br/> <i>Gundam 2</i> also provides players with a few different play mode options. \'Official mode\' is a default campaign where players attempt to level up characters by playing through existing plot lines from the various anime subject matter. In this mode you can choose to play from either the good, or evil side of things, but the characters are set. \'Mission mode\' on the other hand allows players to mix characters and scenarios from the <i>Gundam</i> universe and associate them in different ways for different outcomes. Missions here are divided into several different categories, with completion of missions unlocking further play opportunities and classes of mobile suits. Lastly \'Library mode\' provides players with background information on all the pilots, mobile suits and battle ships in the game. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li>Combines the fast-paced excitement and epic, cinematic action of the <i>Dynasty Warriors</i> gameplay with the rich storylines and characters of the Gundam universe.</li> <li>More mobile suits, plus stories featuring mecha from the latest <i>Gundam</i> series, including Char\'s Counter Attack and more.</li> <li>Play as any of your favorite <i>Gundam</i> characters and mobile suits.</li> <li>Engage in melee battles against the massive Psyco Gundam, which can quickly reconfigure their bodies into titanic mobile fortresses.</li> <li>Customize your mobile suit with mecha parts collected during battle.</li> <li>2-player local co-op multiplayer support.</li> </ul> <b>More Mobile Suits Than Ever</b><br/> Because action in the <i>Gundam</i> series is so heavily influenced by its playable mobile suits, <i>Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2</i> has been designed to include more of these than ever before. Increasing the 19 available in the original <i>Gundam</i> game to more than 60, <i>Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2</i> is destined to provide both newbies to the <i>Gundam</i> universe and longtime fans more of the mechs that brought them to the game in the first place. </td> </tr> </table> <p/>']","by

Confirming that the Titans are developing new Gundam Mk II mobile suits, Quattro and his comrades capture some of the machines and then return to the AEUG flagship, Argama. They are accompanied by a young civilian named Kamille Bidan, a talented pilot with strong newtype potential and no love for the Titans. Evading the pursuing Titans and their allies in the regular Federation Forces, the Argama makes its way to the moon, where the rebels receive new weapons and supplies from their sponsors. After capturing several Federation warships, the AEUG gathers its forces for its first major offensive - a massive mobile suit attack on the Titans\' terrestrial supply base, the underground fortress of Jaburo in South America. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2</i>, like its predecessor, is a hack and slash tactical action game based on several different anime within the popular and long-lived <i>Gundam</i> series. Action in these anime, and thus within <i>Gundam 2</i>, is based around combat that utilizes in-game mechanized mobile suits and the player\'s ability to pilot them in combat against hordes of similarly equipped enemies. The goal in this combat is to level up your chosen character and suit by doing enough damage against the low level enemies you face, and wherever possible, the huge boss character/mechs that are associated with the particular level you find yourself on. Gundam mobile suits feature laser swords, guns, as well as propulsion mechanisms, together which can be used in a few varieties of standard and charging attacks, as well as attacks designed to knock out all enemies within a certain range by charging a power gauge before acting. As you would expect, successful attacks against bosses require much more work and precision, and in many cases rapid input of button prompts flashed during combat. <p/> <b>Multiple Play Modes</b><br/> <i>Gundam 2</i> also provides players with a few different play mode options. \'Official mode\' is a default campaign where players attempt to level up characters by playing through existing plot lines from the various anime subject matter. In this mode you can choose to play from either the good, or evil side of things, but the characters are set. \'Mission mode\' on the other hand allows players to mix characters and scenarios from the <i>Gundam</i> universe and associate them in different ways for different outcomes. Missions here are divided into several different categories, with completion of missions unlocking further play opportunities and classes of mobile suits. \'Library mode\' provides players with background information on all the pilots, mobile suits and battle ships in the game. Lastly \'Versus mode\' via Xbox LIVE allows players to compete against each other in three online campaigns. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li>Combines the fast-paced excitement and epic, cinematic action of the <i>Dynasty Warriors</i> gameplay with the rich storylines and characters of the <i>Gundam</i> universe.</li> <li>More mobile suits, plus stories featuring mecha from the latest <i>Gundam</i> series, including Char\'s Counter Attack and more.</li> <li>Play as any of your favorite <i>Gundam</i> characters and mobile suits.</li> <li>Engage in melee battles against the massive Psyco Gundam, which can quickly reconfigure their bodies into titanic mobile fortresses.</li> <li>Customize your mobile suit with mecha parts collected during battle.</li> <li>2-player local co-op multiplayer and online versus multiplayer support via Xbox LIVE.</li> <li>Xbox LIVE achievements support.</li> </ul> <b>More Mobile Suits Than Ever</b><br/> Because action in the <i>Gundam</i> series is so heavily influenced by its playable mobile suits, <i>Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2</i> has been designed to include more of these than ever before. Increasing the 19 available in the original <i>Gundam</i> game to more than 60, <i>Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2</i> is destined to provide both newbies to the <i>Gundam</i> universe and longtime fans more of the mechs that brought them to the game in the first place. </td> </tr> </table> <p/>']","by

The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth\'s population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars. <p/> AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar.

The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game\'s combat system include \'Rush Mode,\' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; \'Sight In/Sight Out\' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character\'s fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in the <i>Star Ocean</i> series; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member\'s combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Series prequel</b> - <i>Star Ocean: The Last Hope</i> is a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.</li> <li><b>Exciting Battles</b> - Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise\'s famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.</li> <li><b>Compelling Scenes</b> - The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.</li> </ul> <p/><p/>']","by

Separated into the three sections of workout, nutrition, lifestyle, and other activity, the user\'s experience begins with a pep talk from Bob Greene which quickly transitions into the beginnings of action as players set up profiles, choose a virtual personal trainer and enter baseline data like age, weight, gender, fitness goals, etc. Although the nutrition, lifestyle, and other activity sections add a holistic element facilitated by a mix of surveys and data input, building fitness through physical activity is the driving force behind <i>EA SPORTS Active</i> and as such the meat of the content resides in the workout section. Here players will find dozens of themed strength training and cardio workouts which can be customized as you choose and linked into circuit traning routines. These routines are introduced and monitored by your personal trainer, and allow for ongoing player motivation via real-time feedback on your workout form, an approximation of calories burned and the ability to adjust levels of exercise intensity. <p/> <b>Accessories</b><br/> Although activity in <i>EA SPORTS Active</i> flows exclusively through the combination of the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers, it also utilizes a few additional accessories to maximize the functionality of this configuration. The first of these included with the game is the controller leg strap. By attaching this to their upper thigh and then slipping the Nunchuck controller into it, players can utilize the Nunchuck controller\'s motion sensing capabilities while it is connected to the Wii Remote to monitor their leg movements. This allows for cardio exercises like jogging and cardio boxing and strength training activities like squats. Also included with the game is a resistance band designed to increase the intensity of a variety of exercises such as bicep curls and shoulder presses and lifts. In addition, although not included, the Wii Balance board is compatible with many <i>EA SPORTS Active</i> workouts, but only as an optional added controller configuration. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Active Fitness Made Fun &amp; Easy</b> - 20 minute circuits feature a variety of familiar activities that target upper body, lower body as well as cardio. Start off with a light jog, followed by bicep curls and get your heart beating with some cardio boxing.</li> <li><b>Benefit of a Virtual Personal Trainer</b> - Your trainer will be the focal point of the experience guiding you towards your own version of personal achievement. Feedback will be given throughout your workout, keeping you on track to reach your fitness goals.</li> <li><b>The 30 Day Challenge</b> - Take the 30 Day Challenge and experience tailor made 20 minute workouts to your level of fitness. Circuits will change as you progress each day, and <i>EA SPORTS Active</i> will track calories, intensity and progress throughout your journey.</li> <li><b>New Way to Play</b> - Slip the Nunchuk into the specially designed leg strap and hold the Wii Remote in your hand to track your movements from both your upper and lower body. A resistance band is also included to increase the intensity of exercises such as bicep curls and shoulder presses.</li> <li><b>Workout Your Way</b> - Circuits can be customized to your interest and fitness level. Choose your duration, intensity level &amp; set your own goals for calories burned and workout score.</li> <li><b>Workout with a Friend</b> - Burn calories with a friend as you both workout through routines together in a co-operative mode.</li> <li><b>Track Your Progress</b> - Expand your Fitness IQ and keep track of your workouts inside and outside of <i>EA Sports Active</i> with the in-game Journal.</li> <li><b>Wii Balance Board Compatibility</b> - Get more out of your <i>EA SPORTS Active</i> workout using a Wii Balance Board with added functionality for many of exercises.</li> </ul> <b>Co-op Multiplayer Mode</b><br/> Along with its single player experience, <i>EA SPORTS Active</i> also features a deep and entertaining two-player cooperative gameplay mode.

Along the Atlantic coastline, a monster &#151; somehow familiar, yet still quite different from anything ever seen &#151; has been snatching little girls and bringing them back to the undersea city. It is a Big Sister, new denizens of Rapture who were once one of the forgotten little girls known as Little Sisters, known to inhabit the city\'s dank halls. No longer a pawn used to harvest ADAM, the dangerously powerful gene-altering lifeblood of Rapture, from the bodies of others and in turn run the risk of being harvested herself, the Big Sister is now the fastest and most powerful thing in Rapture. You, on the other hand are the very first Big Daddy, in fact the prototype, that for some reason has reactivated. You are similar to the Big Daddies familiar from the original <i>BioShock</i>, but also very different in that you possess free will and no memory of the events of the past ten years. The question is, as you travel through the decrepit and beautiful fallen city beneath the waves, hunting for answers and the solution to your own survival, are you really the hunter, or the hunted? <p/> <b>Gameplay and Multiplayer</b><br/> In <i>BioShock 2</i> players will take on the role of the original Big Daddy, not that of game one protagonist, Jack. As a Big Daddy you will have access to all the strengths and weapons of a standard Big Daddy, including the drill and rivet gun. More importantly you also possess free will and the ability to use plasmids and gene tonics &#151; genetic modifications allowed for through ADAM, a stem cell harvested from conquered enemies, or sea slugs outside the Rapture air lock, and powered by the in-game injectable serum known as EVE, which can be found, captured or purchased. Plasmids and gene tonics provide a wide range of aggressive and passive abilities which can be upgraded and arranged for quick use. The ability to use plasmids and tonics gives you a decided edge over other Big Daddies and most other denizens of Rapture, excluding the powerful Big Sisters. In addition, due to their role as a Big Daddy, players will experience a new relation to the Little Sisters. Upon defeating standard Big Daddys you are given the familiar choice as to whether to harvest or adopt them. Harvesting gains you ADAM immediately, but could alter your path through the game, while adopting makes you responsible for Little Sisters, who then accompany you through Rapture, but also provide aid and warning in times of danger. Additional gameplay features include: new plasmids, weapons and the ability to combine these two. <p/> The game also features the anticipated multiplayer modes. Several of these are team-based, allowing up to 10 players. Within these players are provided with a rich prequel experience that expands the origins of the <i>BioShock</i> fiction, and allows you to play as one of several characters pulled from Rapture\'s history before the events of the first game. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>The Big Sister</b> - No longer just something to be harvested or not, the Big Sister is the most powerful resident in Rapture.</li> <li><b>You Are the Big Daddy</b> - Take control with the original prototype Big Daddy, and experience the power and raw strength of Rapture&rsquo;s most feared denizens as you battle powerful new enemies.</li> <li><b>New Plasmids</b> - New plasmids such as ""Aero Dash"" allowing for bursts of speed over short distances, and ""Geyser Trap"" a stream of water used as a jump pad and electrical conductor, join the ample list of Plasmids from the original game.</li> <li><b>New Game Mechanics</b> - <i>BioShock 2</i> contains many new gameplay mechanics. Just a few of these are: the ability to wield plasmids and weapons simultaneously; flashback missions detailing how you became the Big Daddy; the ability to walk outside the airlocks of Rapture to discover new play areas, and many more.</li> <li><b>New Locations</b> - Just a few of the locations and environments debuting in <i>BioShock 2</i> are Fontaine Futuristics, headquarters of Fontaine\'s business empire and the Kashmir Restaurant.</li> <li><b>Evolution of the Genetically Enhanced Shooter</b> - Innovative advances bring new depth and dimension to each encounter, allowing players to create exciting combinations to fit their style of gameplay.</li> <li><b>Return to Rapture</b> - Set approximately 10 years after the events of the original BioShock, the story continues with an epic, more intense journey through one of the most captivating and terrifying fictional worlds ever created.</li> <li><b>Genetically Enhanced Multiplayer</b> - Earn experience points during gameplay to earn access to new weapons, plasmids and tonics that can be used to create hundreds of different combinations.</li> <li><b>Experience Rapture&rsquo;s Civil War</b> - Players will step into the shoes of Rapture\'s citizens and take direct part in the civil war that tore Rapture apart.</li> <li><b>See Rapture Before the Fall</b> - Experience Rapture before it was reclaimed by the ocean and engage in combat over iconic environments in locations such as Kashmir Restaurant and Mercury Suites, all of which have been reworked from the ground up for multiplayer.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

It is two years after Judgment Day--the date that the Terminator mythology assigns to the nuclear event that the machines will rain down on planet Earth--and what\'s left of humanity is caught in a life and death struggle against that same machine intelligence that sprung to life from the former defense super computer known as Skynet. Yet things are not quite what the the earlier chapters in the Terminator saga had predicted for these days. Although over the last two years human survivors of the catastrophe have prepared and organized themselves for the ongoing battle with the machines, John Connor, the character that the player assumes, has yet to emerge as the legendary hero he was foretold to be, and time is running out. In its early nuclear strikes against humanity, Skynet damaged part of itself. It has spent the last two years rebuilding its strength as well in order to complete its mission of the extermination of the human race. Now is the time to strike back at the machines. Now is the time for you and John Connor to take command. <p/> <b>Gameplay and Co-op Support</b><br/> Action in <i>Terminator: Salvation</i> is from a third-person perspective and relies heavily on the use of cover. Correspondingly players will be able to lock on to cover, dive or slide from one cover point to the next and fire weapons without exposing themselves to return fire, but this doesn\'t mean that combat is easy. Cover is fully destructible in the game, meaning that your mechanical enemies will attempt to take that advantage away from you if they recognize that you are dug in. They will also make every attempt to flank your position. These two points are important because <i>Terminator: Salvation</i> forces you to take care of yourself in its single player campaign by not featuring a health regeneration system between checkpoints (health is fully restored at the end of survived levels). But health can be regenerated during combat via an AI or human teammate anytime when playing in the game\'s local co-op mode. The ability to team up in co-op mode is also a major aspect of gameplay in that it allows players to turn the tables on terminator units by flanking them and attacking their less heavily armored sides rather than head on. Both single player and co-op modes also feature access to vehicles which can be battled from as well. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Terminator Mythology</b> - Set two years prior to the upcoming Terminator Salvation film, play as John Connor for the first time and continue the epic fiction of the Terminator mythology.</li> <li><b>Intelligent Robotic Enemies</b> - Unrelenting and incredibly resilient iconic enemies from the Terminator franchise fight to the bitter end on land and in the sky.</li> <li><b>Destructible Cover Gameplay</b> - Advanced cover mechanics allows you to use the destructible environment as protection and strategically navigate through enemy entrenched territory.

It is two years after Judgment Day--the date that the Terminator mythology assigns to the nuclear event that the machines will rain down on planet Earth--and what\'s left of humanity is caught in a life and death struggle against that same machine intelligence that sprung to life from the former defense super computer known as Skynet. Yet things are not quite what the the earlier chapters in the Terminator saga had predicted for these days. Although over the last two years human survivors of the catastrophe have prepared and organized themselves for the ongoing battle with the machines, John Connor, the character that the player assumes, has yet to emerge as the legendary hero he was foretold to be, and time is running out. In its early nuclear strikes against humanity, Skynet damaged part of itself. It has spent the last two years rebuilding its strength as well in order to complete its mission of the extermination of the human race. Now is the time to strike back at the machines. Now is the time for you and John Connor to take command. <p/> <b>Gameplay and Co-op Support</b><br/> Action in <i>Terminator: Salvation</i> is from a third-person perspective and relies heavily on the use of cover. Correspondingly players will be able to lock on to cover, dive or slide from one cover point to the next and fire weapons without exposing themselves to return fire, but this doesn\'t mean that combat is easy. Cover is fully destructible in the game, meaning that your mechanical enemies will attempt to take that advantage away from you if they recognize that you are dug in. They will also make every attempt to flank your position. These two points are important because <i>Terminator: Salvation</i> forces you to take care of yourself in its single player campaign by not featuring a health regeneration system between checkpoints (health is fully restored at the end of survived levels). But health can be regenerated during combat via an AI or human teammate anytime when playing in the game\'s local co-op mode. The ability to team up in co-op mode is also a major aspect of gameplay in that it allows players to turn the tables on terminator units by flanking them and attacking their less heavily armored sides rather than head on. Both single player and co-op modes also feature access to vehicles which can be battled from as well. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Terminator Mythology</b> - Set two years prior to the upcoming Terminator Salvation film, play as John Connor for the first time and continue the epic fiction of the Terminator mythology.</li> <li><b>Intelligent Robotic Enemies</b> - Unrelenting and incredibly resilient iconic enemies from the Terminator franchise fight to the bitter end on land and in the sky.</li> <li><b>Destructible Cover Gameplay</b> - Advanced cover mechanics allows you to use the destructible environment as protection and strategically navigate through enemy entrenched territory.

But <i>MLB 09</i>\'s Hotshot Fielding changes all that. Now if a ball looks too hot to handle without a little extra effort then it probably is. If you can master the dynamic player reactions possible through Hotshot Fielding then there may be a golden glove in your future, otherwise your fielder may bungle that shot to the gap or line drive. <p/> <b>Online League Play</b><br> Providing you with the ability to set up leagues with up to 30 teams offering full stat tracking, point benefits and rewards. Customize as you see fit; choose your players, teams, length, rules and much more.

In <i>Darkest of Days</i> players physically explore this history and endevor to maintain it as it was meant to unfold. As the game opens the player is snatched from grim date with death by a shadow organization. As unlikely as this would seem, this is only the beginning as you are placed in the even more unlikely position of guardian of key conflicts in human history. Shuttled back and forth in time, it is your task to ensure that specific events on both sides of these conflicts occur as they were meant to happen and that mistakes made along the way are fixed. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Action in <i>Darkest of Days</i> is mission directed. As the player is transported back and forth in time, directives are spelled out that can include anything from victory of one side over the other, to the survival of an individual important to history in an otherwise doomed company and even assasinations. These actions take place in a variety of conflicts within time periods including the Roman era, the American Civil and Indian Wars, WWI and WWII. Mission types include stealth, artillery assaults, and sniper attacks and players can expect in most situations to be called upon to impact events from both sides of the front lines. To make these impacts players will have over 20 weapons on hand, most conflict-specific, but also some futuristic. They will also be able to choose their own means of completing missions according to the resources at hand across wide open battlefields designed to support over 300 combatants, each with their own AI capacities. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Fight in Five Different Time Periods</b> - Whether you are on the slopes of vesuvias in Pompeii, on the battlelines and trenches of Antietam and the clashes of WWI, or the American Indian Wars of the late 19th century, you will fight with real weapons from the time period.

With Russia, special attention is paid to the Krasnodarskiy, Karachayrvo-Cherkesiya, Kabardino-Balkariya and Stavropol&rsquo;skey regions. Some of this area will be recognizable from <i>Flaming Cliffs</i>, but <i>DCS: Black Shark</i> has added a considerable new amount of terrain, particularly much of Georgia. the <i>DCS: Black Shark</i> map is approximately 330,000 sq. km of ground and sea area. <p/> <b>Comprehensive Access to Kamov-50 Avionics Systems</b><br/> <i>DCS: Black Shark</i> comes packed with a wide range of piloting, navigation, targeting and defensive systems avionics for the Ka-50. Game copies include a detailed flight manual covering these, which include, but are not limited to: traditional electromechanical cockpit instruments, multifunction advanced moving map system AMMS (ABRIS), the ""Rubicon"" targeting-navigation system, the I-251 ""Shkval"" antitank targeting system, countermeasure dispensers, a head-up display (HUD) and helmet-mounted sighting (HMS). <p/> <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Aircraft</b><br/> the primary innovation regarding AI aircraft in <i>Black Shark</i> is the inclusion of a new and improved flight model (FM) system. In previous Eagle Dynamics products such as <i>Lock On</i>, the AI-aircraft FM did not reach a high-level of realism, relying sometimes instead on animations to supplement flight dynamics equations. This absence of detailed angle of attack modeling and the influence of cross wind led to problems during advanced maneuvers. To remedy this <i>Black Shark</i> features the same standard flight model (SFM) that was used for player-controlled aircraft in <i>Lock On</i>. With this advancement in AI aircraft flight dynamics it is now possible for the AI to conduct more advanced flight maneuvers and combat tactics. <p/> <b>Ground Vehicles, Ships and Weapons</b><br/> Ground vehicles, ships and weapons such as bombs, rockets, missiles and cannons have been significantly improved in <i>Black Shark</i>. Improvements include: an expanded roster of available active ground vehicles, the ability of each ground vehicle to use multiple types of weapons simultaneously, an overall increase in the level of detail and the inclusion of infantry units. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li>Advanced helicopter and ground force AI that creates a realistic combat environment.</li> <li>Twice the ground detail of previous TFC simulations, featuring detailed modeling of 330,000 sq. km of the western Caucasus region.</li> <li>Head-to-head and cooperative multiplayer.</li> <li>Powerful mission editor with advanced scripting capability.</li> <li>Campaign system with a moving front line that depends on mission results.</li> <li>Highly-detailed six degrees of freedom cockpit featuring Mouse-clickable instruments.</li> <li>Unrivaled flight physics system featuring realistic damage model, system cascade effect and more.</li> <li>Detailed modeling and control of engine, fuel, hydraulics, electrical, navigation, radio, fire suppression, sensor, and weapon systems.</li> <li>Two gameplay modes: ""Simulation"" or ""Game Console.""</li> <li>Advanced weapon physics for missiles, rockets and cannon rounds including ricochets.</li> <li>Supports TrackIR, Matrox TripleHead2Go for multiple screens, D-Box motion platform.</li> </ul> <h4>System Requirements:</h4> <table border=1 cellpadding=""3"" align=""center"" width=50%> <tr> <td> </td> <td align=center><b>Minimum Specifications:</b> </td> <td align=center><b>Recommended Specifications:</b> </td> <tr> <td>OS: </td> <td align=center>Windows XP, Vista</td> <td align=center>Windows Vista for launching in fullscreen mode </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Processor: </td> <td align=center>2 GHz </td> <td align=center>Intel Core 2 Duo E6850+, AMD Phenom 9850+</td> </tr> <tr> <td>RAM: </td> <td align=center>1GB </td> <td align=center>2GB or more </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Video Card: </td> <td align=center>256 MB ATI or nVidia, DirectX 9 compatible </td> <td align=center>512+ MB ATI HD 2900+ or nVidia 8800+, DirectX 9 compatible </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sound Card: </td> <td align=center>DirectX 9 compatible </td> <td align=center>DirectX 9 compatible </td> </tr> <tr> <td>DVD-ROM: </td> <td colspan=2 align=center>Quad-speed (4x) DVD-ROM drive </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hard Drive Space: </td> <td colspan=2 align=center>4GB of free space or more</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Other: </td> <td align=center>Copy protected, requires Internet activation </td> <td align=center>Copy protected, requires Internet activation; Joystick</td> </tr> </table> </td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table>']","by

As you guide the tribe through this new world using specific rhythmic commands tapped out on your mystical drum via the PSP\'s face buttons and equip your troops with weapons and armor, you will come face to face with a new tribe of enemies-the Karmen, encounter a mysterious and mighty Hero Patapon and uncover the ruins of Patapolis, a mystical place long spoke of in Patapon legend. <p/> <b>Multiplayer</b><br/> One of the most exciting new elements of <i>Patapon 2</i> is its inclusion of multiplayer via a PSP ad-hoc connection. Supporting up to four players, this play option actually consists of two modes containing a link to the single player campaign. During multiplayer action all players assume the role of the Hero Patapon, but are not limited to a single form. Players\' Hero Patapons are fully customizable, able to take the shape of any of the Patapon warrior classes, and allowing players to show off their distinct, one-of-a-kind heroes to the world. <p/> Working together, players embark on a series of mission of increasing difficulty, designed to test their skills as individual warriors as well as team players. But even the most powerful of Patapon Heroes who venture into this online adventure will find that he/she needs something extra to carry the day. In a nod to the Karmen, the tribes\' new enemy in <i>Patapon 2</i>, here players will ultimately have to don a ceremonial mask to obtain the strength to survive and succeed. But to secure a mask players will need to have obtained a certain item during their time spent playing through the game\'s single player campaign. Once produced players will have to work together to transform this item into the mask. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Rhythm and Action Collide</b> - Master all 8 drum rhythms including the new jump command, power up command and party command. Combine the various chains of drumbeats to address each unique level, leading the Patapons to victory over the masked Karmens.</li> <li><b>Patapon Evolution</b> - Improve your troops fighting and defense skills by leveling up or evolving into other Patapon forms.</li> <li><b>Create your own Patapon Hero</b> - Introducing the new Patapon Hero, a prized fighter that you can customize to fit any sort of fighting style desired. Unlock new abilities by mixing weapons and Patapon Hero masks.</li> <li><b>Additional Patapons</b> - Discover the new ranks of Patapons: Toripon the flying bird riders; Robopon mech warriors and Mahopon the magicians. Unlock these new warriors to fight alongside all the warriors from the original game.</li> <li><b>Multiplayer Mode</b> - <i>Patapon 2</i> introduces multiplayer gameplay through game sharing.</li> <li><b>Three Additional Commands and Miracles</b> - More drumbeat commands allow for different tactics and gameplay action.</li> <li><b>Strategic Gaming</b> - <i>Patapon 2</i> delivers a strong element of strategy by requiring players to properly customize and build up the Patapon army, arm each soldier with particular weapons and armor, and position them correctly for battle.</li> <li><b>Mission Variety</b> - Take part in more than 80 specific missions including hunting, escort, and boss battles, and explore numerous vivid environments along the way. Players will discover up to 22 bosses and access hundreds of new items and weapons throughout the adventure.</li> <li><b>Unique Art Style</b> - French graphic artist Rolito, noted for his abstract art style seen in collectible toys, animation, and websites, lends his skills to create a variety of unique characters and environments, bringing the Patapon world to life.</li> <li><b>Mini-Games</b> - Seven music-based mini-games allow players to earn bonuses and upgrades to further customize the Patapon warriors.</li> </ul> <b>Improved \'Fever Mode\' Functionality</b><br/> <i>Patapon 2</i> features new and improved \'Fever Mode\' functionality. Fever Mode is a state in the game reached when players have successfully completed a certain number of consecutive combos, effectively ratcheting up their Patapons\' fighting ability and efficiency in battle for as long as they continue adding successive combos. In the original <i>Patapon</i>, activating and maintaining this mode provided an ever growing rhythmic challenge as the game progressed, but was not necessarily manageable for all players. <i>Patapon 2</i> eliminates this potential issue by giving players an option to play at an easier level until they get the hang of the game\'s rhythm, at which point they can switch back to the standard play mode if they wish. Also new with <i>Patapon 2</i> is \'Fever Alert.\' Through this players are kept aware of the agitation level of their Patapons via on-screen alerts, allowing for precious seconds needed to string together the necessary combos to extend Fever Mode when need be. </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Sensing that something is afoot, the Minion horde has made its way north to the town of Nordberg. Here they find a male child the likes of which has not been seen since the coming of the original overlord. This child is obviously special, but time is short and he has much to learn.

In it the original overlord is no more, and in his absence the order of things have changed dramatically. The comically evil, but still deadly gremlin-like army known as Minions are lost without a leader to focus their chaotic power for good, ill or both. Yet change finally appears to be in the air. Sensing that something is afoot, the Minion horde has made its way north to the town of Nordberg. Here they find a male child the likes of which has not been seen since the coming of the original overlord. This child is obviously special, but time is short and he has much to learn. In recent days a new power has arisen, known as the ""Glorious Empire."" Based in Roman-like legionary tactics, the power of this new enemy is being used to take over all the relinquished territories of the old overlord, and to extinguish all the magic in the land in order to weaken all potential enemies. As the new overlord it\'s your task to gain all the strength and skills you can, harness the power of the Minion horde and take back what is yours.', '<strong>Gameplay - Destroy or Dominate</strong><br /> <em>Overlord II</em> features a brand new corruption system that empowers players to enact their evil will through either domination or destruction. Play as a dominating overlord and villages and people will fall under your command with rewards and benefits coming over time. Follow a destructive path, obliterating anything that stands in your way, and you&rsquo;ll become a demonic lord of chaos. The choice is yours.', ""<strong>Manage Your Minions</strong><br /> Effective control your Minions was a big part of <em>Overlord</em>, and in <em>Overlord II</em> all four varieties of Minions return smarter, deadlier (and funnier) and are ready to fight in large scale battles that will see their wild pack mentality squaring up to the organized legions of the Glorious Empire. As in the previous game, they'll do anything and everything their overlord commands of them, especially now that they can run ravage and wreck buildings and scenery and each have their own specialty in combat; Browns are the main general use soldier units, Reds with their fire-throwing ability are useful for long-range combat, Greens are experts at stealth maneuvers and Blues provide support and healing to other Minions. In addition, they've also learned a powerful new skill, how to ride. Three of the four kinds of Minions feature exclusive mounts: Browns on wolves, Greens on giant spiders that can climb walls and the Reds on salamanders. Atop their mounts these merry fighters are faster, and stronger than ever before."", '<strong>Multiplayer Options</strong><br /> Along with a robust single player campaign <em>Overlord II</em> features a wealth of multiplayer play options.

Awaking in a strange world, they are soon sought out by a little girl named May. She tells them that the world around them was created from souls gathered from other worlds and that if this stealing of souls from other places does not stop, sooner or later those other places--that is reality--will disappear forever. To stop this from happening they will have to defeat this new world\'s evil master by releasing all the souls now confined to his nightmare world.

As players set about freeing the trapped souls supporting the nightmare world that they are stuck in, they engage in turn-based team battles. This is where the characters from previous games come in. Players must enlist them to join in party-based battles. Success in these battles is based on the ability to string together specific moves into chain attack sequences, which in turn unlock even stronger combinations when successful. Players can also increase their characters\' stats and abilities by acquiring additional costumes called \'forms\' and redressing their characters in them. Female characters physical appearances can also be changed based on the form they\'re wearing. <p/> The goal of the game is to release souls. You can find and collect souls by searching around area maps. Exposure to souls can grant players items or unlock events. Along with soul related events, maps will also point players to other helpful locations such as event points, points at which other events may occur, and save points, where you can save your game as well as buy, sell and trade items. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><i>Cross Edge</i> combines classic RPG combat with a grid-based Strategy RPG combat to create a hybrid battle system.

Combat within the games consists of multiple stages, which make up the games\' missions. Within these missions players have use of a variety of aircraft which they use to attack targets both in the air and on the ground. Each aircraft depending on the game played, features a selection of weapon options including standard firepower along the line of missiles, lasers and bombs. Aircraft also possess different charged/special attacks, some of which are exclusive to multiplayer games. Players receive points for success in taking out mission identified targets as well as collecting bonus items known as ""medals"" that appear on the gameplay area. <p/> <b>Key Features</b>: <ul> <li>All three <i>Raiden Fighters</i> games on one disc.</li> <li>Training mode, with slow-motion, level selection, and ship configuration.</li> <li>Leaderboards and gameclips for online and offline play.</li> <li>Two-player cooperative offline play.</li> <li>Standard vertical scrolling, full-screen side-scrolling, or full-screen vertical scrolling on a rotated display.</li> <li>Visual filters to simulate classic display-types, or change the feel of the game.</li> <li>An Xbox 360 exclusive containing 32 Xbox LIVE achievements and 1,000 gamer points</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

and jump straight into action as they instantly switch between robot, vehicle and weapon modes to fight for the preservation or annihilation of all mankind. In addition, for the first time in the Transformers universe, players can also fight the epic war between Autobots and Decepticons online in explosive multiplayer combat. <p/> <b>The Story</b><br/> Set a few years after the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, <i>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</i> reveals that the threat from the Decepticons is in fact, far from ended. Since the time of the epic and apparently not so final battle between the two Transformer leaders, Decepticons have started popping up again all over Earth in alarming numbers. And now, a mysterious object from space seems destined to shift the balance of power and give the upper hand to the Decepticons. <p/> <b>Mission-centric Gameplay</b><br/> Unlike Activision\'s <i>Transformers: The Game</i>, released along side the original movie back in 2007, <i>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</i> relies less on open-world gameplay and more on structured, but varied mission play. The variety in these missions comes from the fact that players can align themselves with either the Autobots or Decepticons, and that the available missions both parallel the events of the movie, as well as events unique to the game. During these missions players will be able to play as a variety of different Transformers from either side of the conflict, and with success in mission play will be able to unlock additional Transformers and earn points used to upgrade your selected faction. Playable characters include on the Autobot side: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Breakaway, Bumblebee, and Ratchet; and from the Decepticon side: Starscream, Sideways (a new character), Grindor, Long Haul, and Megatron. Additional Transformer types will be available in multiplayer modes. The game features a simple control toggle that not only allows for quick switching between mech, vehicle and weapon forms, but also allows for a more easy learning curve of the acrobatic moves from the movie. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>The Choice is Yours</b> &ndash; Players can step into the shoes of their favorite Autobots and Decepticons such as Optimus Prime, Starscream, Bumblebee and Ironhide, along with new characters making their first appearance in a game. With two distinct campaigns that allow gamers to save or destroy the human race, gamers will unlock missions and be able to play them in any order they desire and with different characters for a whole new experience.</li> <li><b>Outmaneuver Your Opponents</b> &ndash; Instantaneously convert from a colossal robot to a dynamic land or air vehicle such as a diesel truck, sports car, military chopper or fighter jet. New, ultra-fluid transformations can be performed in-motion anytime and anywhere, allowing players to strategically propel through and decimate hordes of enemies with incredible agility.</li> <li><b>Take the Battle Online with Friends</b> &ndash; For the first time ever in the Transformers universe, gamers can engage in full multiplayer action, taking the epic war between the Autobots and Decepticons online to play with friends in a multitude of competitive game modes as they utilize their characters\' unique weapons and abilities to lead their teams to victory.</li> <li><b>Demolish Your Enemies</b> &ndash; Each Transformer can unleash a unique array of assaults on its enemies ranging from powerful missile attacks and rapid-fire chain guns to explosive energy blasts and visceral melee strikes, allowing players to pick from a variety of weapons and moves in their character\'s arsenal that deliver diverse gameplay in every brutal encounter.</li> <li><b>Intense, Heroic Missions</b> &ndash; Every second is precious as players drive, fly, fight and blast their way through gripping, pulse-pounding levels straight from the film and beyond to determine the ultimate fate of the world.</li> </ul> <b>Multiplayer Options</b><br/> One of the major improvements of <i>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</i> over any previous Transformers releases is its extensive multiplayer options, both locally and online, co-op and versus. These modes include standard head-to-head/team options such as Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, but also unique modes like \'One Shall Stand\' where players must take out the opposing leader, \'Control Points\' where teams struggle to control specific map points at specific times, and \'Battle for the Shards\' which is a \'capture the flag\' variant tasking teams to collect and hold all the pieces of the destroyed Allspark from the 2007 film. </td> </tr> </table>']","by
