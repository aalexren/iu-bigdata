Lucky for the brothers, they have more power-ups available than ever before. Fly above the action using the Super Leaf, swim faster by donning the Frog Suit, or defeat enemies using the Hammer Bros. Suit. Use the brand-new overworld map to take the chance to play a minigame in hopes of gaining extra lives or to find a Toad&#39s House where you can pick up additional items. All this (and more) combines into one of gaming&#39s most well-known and beloved titles - are you ready to experience gaming bliss?', 'Released to critical acclaim in North America in 1990, <i>Super Mario Bros 3</i> is still a must-have Mario game. A 2-D side-scroller originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, the game features dozens of levels of quirky, colorful, action-packed awesomeness spread across seven massive game regions. There&#39s Grass Land, Desert Land, Water Land, Giant Land (where everything is super-sized!), Sky Land, Ice Land, Pipe Land, and the mysterious Dark Land. Each land features several levels of intense platforming action. Bowser has sent his children to wreak havoc. The Koopa Kids have stolen the royal magic wands from each land and turned the kings of Mushroom World into wild animals. On his quest to restore order, Mario travels through deserts, fortresses, airships, ice fields, water worlds, and many more strange and wonderful locales. In addition to the seven Koopa Kids, Bowser has hundreds of minions. Fortunately, Mario has some fantastic power-ups at his disposal, beyond the tried-and-true Mushrooms and Fire Flowers of earlier games. Among them:<ul><li>Super Leaf, an item that turns Mario into Raccoon Mario</li><li>Frog Suit, an outfit that allows Mario to swim faster than normal</li><li>Tanooki Suit, an outfit that turns Mario into Tanooki Mario and allows him to become like a statue</li><li>Jugem&#39s Cloud, an item that allows Mario to easily float through an area</li><li>Magic Wing, an item that bestows the power of flight upon Mario</li><li>Music Box, an item that lulls the pesky Hammer Brothers to sleep</li><li>Magic Whistle, a legendary item that...Well, just find out for yourself!</li></ul>Even the map is interactive in this game, with special tools and tricks needed to open up super-secret areas.

This affords you the luxury of turning up controller sensitivities to get the closest feel to a mouse possible on a console. The greater leverage offers you better control and less forcealleviating thumb-fatigue and adding more comfort to long gaming sessions. In short, this increased accuracy and decreased thumb-fatigue results in more kills and less deaths.\n\nIn the competitive world of online gaming, youd be crazy to play without the FPS Freek!\n\nFPS Freek is designed to fit both the PS3 and Xbox 360 controllers but will also fit many third-party versions.\n\nWorks great in games like:\n\n * Modern Warfare 2\n * Battlefield: Bad Company 2\n * Call of Duty: Black Ops\n * Halo: Reach\n * Medal of Honor']","by

This integration also allows the tablet to draw just enough energy to power itself from the Wii Remote, meaning less batteries to change and zero battery drain when the tablet is disconnected and not in use.

Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that infested Earth for decades and caused years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative and the Brotherhood of Nod, was close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. In the midst of this crisis, Kane, Nod\'s prophetic leader, emerged from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he had developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he could not build this ""Tiberium Control Network"" without GDI\'s cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions&mdash;GDI and Nod&mdash;found themselves in a desperate and unlikely alliance to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind. <p/> Now, after 15 years, the network is nearly complete. Tiberium is under strict control and the revitalized Earth is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress. It is only now that the world\'s citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what he will want in return. Kane. GDI. Nod. Tiberium. How will it end? These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the 15-year Tiberium saga in <i>Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight</i>. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Command &amp; Conquer</i> is a real-time strategy gaming franchise, and <i>Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight</i> is no exception. Players assume color-coated versions of the GDI or Nod factions and uncover segments of the map, where they must manage Tiberium and other resources in their possession or that they they mine or commandeer in the field. Other factions occur in the game, but are not playable, and different single player campaigns are available to players depending on which of the two factions are chosen. The energy that Tiberium crystals possess is used in the manufacture and upgrading of mining and combat units, weapons and support infrastructure in preparation for impending conflicts with other players on the same map that are doing the same. Each faction has its own distinct unit types, both land and air based, which although unique, are overall more or less balanced against those of opposing faction. In addition, certain units can be captured on the battlefield and used to supplement your arsenal. The overarching task though is to combine the right number and type of units with the right battlefield strategy for the conflict and terrain at hand. <p/> Historically, <i>C&amp;C</i> matches have been won by completely eliminating all enemy units that stand against you. Although there is certainly plenty of this within <i>Tiberian Twilight</i>, the game also is different in that players need not eliminate all enemy units, instead capturing control nodes throughout the game and holding them for a minimum amount of time. Doing so leads to earning enough points to win the match. <i>Tiberian Twilight</i> also differs from earlier games in the series with the addition of certain RPG game elements. Players overall orientation within their chosen faction is class based, with units falling generally in offensive, defensive or support classes depending on your play style. These units can be upgraded with experience points, which are gained through success against enemy units, with more advanced enemy units earning the conquering player more points, and thus potential unit upgrade opportunity. <p/> <b>5-on-5 Online Multiplayer</b><br/> <i>Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight</i> allows PC gamers to team up and battle like never before. Join your fellow commanders online and tackle your opponents in the biggest C&amp;C multiplayer to date, featuring 5 vs. 5 objective-based battles. Choose your favorite class and take online strategy action to the next level as you conquer objectives while pummeling your enemies. In addition, an all-new party system lets you move with your party of friends from one online battle to the next. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>The Epic Conclusion to the Tiberium Saga</b> - Kane returns in the thrilling conclusion to one of gaming\'s longest running storylines, told through gritty live-action cinematics. Choose to take on the campaign solo or team up with a friend and play cooperatively.</li> <li><b>Persistent Player Progression</b> - The more enemy units you destroy, the more experience points you earn to progress your player profile. Level up to unlock new units, powers, and upgrades to make your army more powerful.</li> <li><b>Always on the Move</b> - For the first time ever in the C&amp;C series, a massive, mobile, all-in-one base, The Crawler, lets you pack up and move your base with your army for a new layer of strategic depth.

Fueled by our desire to win, the FPS Freek was developed for the sole purpose of becoming better at first-person shooters. The result has become somewhat of a legend. Proven a winner time and time again, the FPS Freek has been praised by numerous professionals, enthusiasts and n00bs alike.\n\nBy increasing the length of the thumb-sticks slightly, precision while aiming is improved dramatically. Your range of motion is increased by 40%, giving you the opportunity to make smaller adjustments and snap to targets much faster in first-person shooters. This affords you the luxury of turning up controller sensitivities to get the closest feel to a mouse possible on a console. The greater leverage offers you better control and less forcealleviating thumb-fatigue and adding more comfort to long gaming sessions. In short, this increased accuracy and decreased thumb-fatigue results in more kills and less deaths.\n\nIn the competitive world of online gaming, youd be crazy to play without the FPS Freek!\n\nFPS Freek is designed to fit both the PS3 and Xbox 360 controllers but will also fit many third-party versions.\n\nWorks great in games like:\n\n * Modern Warfare 2\n * Battlefield: Bad Company 2\n * Call of Duty: Black Ops\n * Halo: Reach\n * Medal of Honor']","by

And why not, since what sim doesn\'t need a vacation. Players choose from environments set Egypt, France or China, with the possibility of others via download. Similarly, gameplay follows the same well-worn path familiar to veteran<i>The Sims</i> players, and easy to pick up for those coming to the franchise for the first time. Players create their sims as they like, customizing everything from physical characteristics, all the way down to personality traits, habits, etc. They can mix with other sims, build relationships, start families and even die. Because this expansion is based around travel, your sims can also discover rich, new cultures, develop brand-new skills and abilities and explore and adventure through realistic environments. New skills related to these destinations include photography, martial arts, and nectar making (a sim beverage) among others. As part of of the exotic locales available, sims can get adventurous and explore the caves and tombs of Egypt and China. Here they will put their new adventure related abilities to work as they participate in Indiana Jones like adventures full of excitement and even danger, including some not-so friendly mummies and the Grim Reaper. <p/> <b>Unique Simlish Soundtrack</b><br/> Just as with travel, every sim has his/her particular musical tastes. With that in mind the <i>World Adventures Expansion Pack</i> features an all-star soundtrack of real songs, recorded by the original artists in the sims native tongue of Simlish.

Vehicles used in the races run the gamut from specific MX bikes, and ATVS, to super buggies and trucks. Gameplay in the dirt-covered environments faced require skill and guts to master.

It also has a major role to play while while you are in the air, allowing players to pull off tricks like never before. There are several tricks and freestyle variations possible, all of which will take some time to discover and master, but the basic trick performance mechanism is simple.

In the event that players can't manage to use the Rider Reflex control system to right themselves as they come back to earth, this automatic system provides a last chance to avoid the disaster by alerting you to your danger with an onscreen arrow as the ground rises to meet you. Players must quickly flick the right stick in the direct of the arrow for the rider to regain his balance and keep on going. But expect to be challenged.

Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...<br /><br /> <strong>Key Features</strong><br /><br /> <ul> <li>A truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.</li> <li>A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.</li> <li>Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.</li> <li>New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.</li> <li>Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.</li> <li>Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.</li> <li>Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.</li> <li>Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!</li> <li>Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.</li> <li>Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options. Geralt will surmount barriers, jump over fences, scale walls and ascend rock formations.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><br /> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""98%""> <tbody> <tr> <td align=""left"" valign=""top""> <table align=""right"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""620""> <tbody> <tr> <td align=""right"" valign=""top"" width=""620""> <img alt=""Witcher 2 Collector\'s Edition Contents"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_contents_collectors.jpg"" style=""border: 0;"" /> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong>Collector Edition Contents</strong><br /><br /> <u>GAME DVD</u><br /> The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings game DVD.<br /><br /> <u>MAKING-OF DVD</u><br /> All the cinematic materials related to game - trailers, dev diaries, gameplay footage, interviews and making-of exclusive video.<br /><br /> <u>OST CD</u><br /> Audio-CD with in-game music.<br /><br /> <u>ETUI</u><br /> Box with all the contents of The Witcher 2 Premium Edition.<br /><br /> <u>WORLD MAP</u><br /> A map of the game\'s world.<br /><br /> <u>GAME GUIDE</u><br /> The Witcher 2 strategy guide for both novice and experienced role-playing fans.<br /><br /> <u>GAME MANUAL</u><br /> A rulebook and interface explanation to help you get started.<br /><br /> <u>PAMPHLET AND COIN</u><br /> A physical representation of one of the in-game items.<br /><br /> <u>PAPERCRAFTS</u><br /> Two papercraft dolls - Geralt and one random character for collectors.<br /><br /> <u>GERALT&rsquo;S HEAD</u><br /> Ultra-detailed head sculpture of Geralt of Rivia.

Unfortunately, Niko&rsquo;s search for the American Dream and a much needed fresh start, hits an immediate snag when the rags to riches story Roman spun to pique Niko\'s interest is exposed as not only a complete fabrication, but a ploy to enlist Niko&rsquo;s well-known skills as a tough guy against the ample list of enemies clamoring for Roman&rsquo;s debt-ridden blood.', 'Because Roman is the only person Niko knows in Liberty City he begrudgingly accepts his role as Roman&rsquo;s protector despite the deception. But as time goes on Niko comes into his own, and his experience on the wrong side of the tracks proves more valuable than he could have ever imagined as he fights for survival and later supremacy on the crime ridden streets of Liberty City.', '<strong>Game Environments</strong><br />Based on several of the boroughs of New York City and parts of New Jersey, Liberty City, familiar to players of previous games in the series, has been entirely redesigned for <em>GTA IV</em>. Players can expect visible detail down to the weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk, cars and buildings of visibly different ages and a much greater level if verticality in the buildings and bridges that they are able to explore as Niko moves through the city streets. In addition, pedestrians in <em>GTA IV</em> are much more realistic. No longer simply moving cardboard cutouts, these NPCs are intelligent, modern, human representations that laugh, cry, eat, drink, use cell phones and ATMs, and talking amongst themselves regardless of Niko&rsquo;s interaction with them.', '<strong>Gameplay</strong><br /> Historically <em>GTA</em> games have focused heavily on mission-based play, requiring successful completion of fixed tasks in order for players to progress through the game, but this has changed to a great extent in <em>GTA IV</em>. Players will experience an entirely new and exciting emphasis centered on the blending of on-mission and off-mission play, resulting not only in an increased sense of realism, but more interesting and unrestricted gameplay.', '<strong>Features</strong><br />Aside from the car jacking and a detailed city environment here are the new features for <em>GTA IV</em>:', '<strong>Multiplayer</strong> <br />Give Niko a rest and create your own multiplayer ""hero."" <em>GTA</em> has added multiplayer modes allowing you to take your creation out to play online in competitive, co-op, and free form modes. Competitive mode has you fighting against the cops, jacking cars, or racing to finish odd jobs. Co-op challenges you and your friends with various tasks including Hangman\'s NOOSE where you are responsible for escorting a wanted kingpin to a safe extraction point. Freeform lets you and 15 others lose on Liberty City. Use this mode to hit up the bar and play virtual darts versus each other or head out to the streets and set up your own drag races. If you can dream it, you can do it in Freeform mode.', '<strong>ZiT: We\'ll Spot The Song For You</strong> <br />When playing Grand Theft Auto IV, if you hear a song that you are interested in buying as an MP3, all you have to do is dial ZiT-555-0100 on your in-game mobile phone and a text message will be sent to you with the name of the artist and the title of the track. The next time you log in at the Rockstar Games Social Club, you will find 30-second previews of all the songs you have ZiT\'ed while playing the game.

Introducing the PS3 & PS Move Assault Rifle Controller from CTA Digital. Our unique rifle controller has every button featured on a standard PS3 Dualshock controller, including clickable thumb sticks for strafing, running, steadying your weapon and looking around within the game environment. It also includes a rumble effect similar to the PS3 Dualshock. To sync wirelessly, all you need to do is plug the USB antenna into the console and press the home button on the Assault Rifle. That's it! Perfect for titles such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops, or Battlefield Bad Company 2 as the R1 button is mapped to the trigger. With the Assault Rifle Controller from CTA Digital, there's simply no need for your standard PS3 controller. The controller also works with the PlayStation Move. Just attach the cradle and insert a motion controller to play various Move compatible warfare titles, such as MAG, Killzone 3, Time Crisis: Razing Storm, Dead Space: Extraction and SOCOM 4. The unique dual trigger system of the Assault Rifle also makes contact with the Move motion controller's T button. In addition, the rest of the rifle can mimic the functions of a Move navigation controller. Another great feature is the built-in speaker; the assault rifle controller comes alive with blasting sounds when you pull the trigger (single shot, three shot burst, and fully automatic modes). These sound effects can be activated even if the Assault Rifle Controller is not synced with the PS3, and can also easily be turned off. Powered by 2 AA batteries. Package includes: (1) Assault Rifle Controller, (1) Bluetooth USB Adapter (1) Scope, (1) Stock, (1) PlayStation Move Motion Cradle.""]","by

Additional features include: a six level Career mode, the ability to pick the tracks you want to dance to in Free mode, Xbox LIVE Avatar integration and more.', ""Get ready to party with your friends and dance together with no controllers in <i>Dance Paradise</i>. <i>Dance Paradise</i> utilizes the camera based motion capture technology built into the Microsoft Kinect system (sold separately). Once Kinect is installed, correctly placed in the room and has mapped the tracked points of an individual player's body, your body in effect becomes your controller. No more buttons, no more dance pads, just your body moving to the the groove and as prompted onscreen. <i>Dance Paradise</i> is also the most advanced Kinect based dance game. It comes with the most music of any Kinect dance game released to date - 40 original hit songs from the hottest artists, like Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Taio Cruz and more, and original video content that accompanies the music tracks.

This is made possible through the real-time motion capture abilities of Kinect. Gameplay in <i>Dance Paradise</i> is based around the game's four color-coded dance lanes. As music tracks and videos run in the background and your Xbox LIVE avatar cheers you on from themed game environments, two-dimensional representations of the dance move you are to mimic slide down the dance lanes towards you in a conveyer belt fashion at the center of the screen. In the few seconds that it takes for these representations to reach the bottom front of the screen they have repeated the move several times. At the end of each lane is a virtual dance pad, which when reached by the two-dimensional figure is your queue to mimic the dance move. A variety of the possible moves slide down all four lanes with players hopping laterally to adjacent dance pads to unleash their versions of them. Moves are rated in real-time and proceed in rhythm with the track. Successful moves fill the player's in-game vitality bar, while unsuccessful attempts subtract from it. Your game ends if the bar is completely drained."", ""<i>Dance Paradise</i> features multiple game modes in both single player and multiplayer. Single player modes include: Free Play, in which you can queue up the tracks you want and dance away to your heart's content; Training Mode where you can practice the individual moves that you will see in in-game action; and Career Mode - 6 progressive game levels, each of which contain specific challenges that must be met before you can move on to the next. Two player multiplayer modes include: Attack mode, a mode in which after filling their vitality bars players can unleash power-ups that throw off the dance moves of opponents; Versus mode, where players dance off to the same tracks with the winner being the most accurate; and Synchro mode, a cooperative play option where two players must dance in synch to the same track and moves.""]","by
