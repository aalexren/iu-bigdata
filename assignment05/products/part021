Fisher is now a renegade operative digging into the events of the past and he doesn\'t like what he has found. His personal investigation into his daughter\'s death reveals that he\'s been betrayed by his former agency, the Third Echelon. The agency responds by pursuing him, but as he works to elude them he becomes aware of a deadly terrorist plot that threatens millions.

Visit the grim reality of Victorian London and then travel to the beautiful yet ghastly Wonderland to uncover the root of Alice's madness and discover the truth behind a deadly secret, kept hidden for years. Features include: upgradable melee weapons and magic abilities, a shattered gameword filled with altered versions of Lewis Carroll's famous characters and intuitive and rewarding puzzle play."", ""Eleven years ago a horrific fire took Alice's family from her and left her mind horrifically scarred. Afterwards she was confined to Rutledge Asylum where she struggled to confront her demons by slipping slipping further into her fantasy world of Wonderland. Now, after ten years, she has finally secured her release - yet she still bears the heavy psychological burden of that tragic event."", 'With her mind in tatters, she is unable to resolve the fear prompted by her strange memories, dreams, and visions. Perhaps she\'ll do better in Wonderland. She always has. She travels there, seeking what the ""real"" world can\'t provide: security, knowledge, and the truth about the past. But in her absence, Wonderland too has suffered. Something has gone horribly wrong, and now a great evil is descending upon what once was her beautiful refuge. Can Alice save Wonderland -- and herself -- from the madness that consumes them both?', ""<em>Alice: Madness Returns</em> like the original 2000 game release for PC that it is a sequel to, is a third-person, single player, action game that incorporates platforming and combat gameplay. Playing as Alice players retreat into Wonderland for comfort from the real world, only to find it in even more shambles than before. Yet this world that exists in Alice's head holds the secrets to her repressed memories and the truth behind the murder of her family. Players must fight their way across this world using a mixture of melee weapons, magic and puzzle-solving and platforming skills to defeat a variety of enemy types, each with particular strengths and weakness. By besting each, players collect in-game currency that can be used to upgrade weapons and skills. In addition to combat players also must explore every corner of this strange world to find clues, messages and potions that help to literally unlock memories that will finally expose the truth behind the madness."", '<em>* Please note that NVIDIA GeForce 8400, 9400, 210; ATI Radeon HD 2400, HD 3200, HD 4300 as well as integrated versions of supported chipsets are below minimum system requirements) For best results, make sure the latest drivers for both video and audio cards are installed.

He is the last of a noble and respected line. Raised in a series of safehouses by families loyal to his father's memory, Lucas will not rest until the Legion is rebuilt, and his family's honor is restored. Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword. While slower to swing and less practical for one-on-one combat, it can strike multiple foes and knock them back, making it an ideal weapon for crowd control.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><strong>Anjali</strong><br /> Anjali is an archon - a legend, come to life. In the old stories, archons were spirits of fire, who served the long-lost creator gods. But Anjali was raised by friends of the Legion, and she does not know how she came to this world, or what happened to the others of her kind.<br /><br /> Anjali can shift freely between her human form and an incarnation of elemental fire. In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray. In her fiery incarnation, she can hurl bolts of flame at ranged targets, flood areas with heat and fire, or inflict searing wounds that injure her foes over time.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><strong>Katarina</strong><br /> Katarina is the daughter of a Legion commander and a Lescanzi witch. Her mother's people are nomads and wanderers, skilled in both warfare and magic, Katarina has been trained in their ways. At long range, she fights with ensorcelled bullets and deadly curses. When foes get close, they fare no better, as they come face-to-muzzle with her pistol and her shotgun &ndash; or perhaps the jaws of her faithful black hound. Katarina is mischievous and unpredictable, but she is also devoted to the Legion's cause...<br /><br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><strong>Reinhart</strong><br /> Reinhart descended from a great line of Legion mages, but he spent most of his life in Stonebridge, studying magic at the Collegium. As a scholar of arcane magic, Reinhart bends the forces of creation and destruction to his will. He can channel Dynamic magic through his gauntlet, shocking or stunning his foes. Or he can use Entropic magic to warp time and space, destroying large numbers of enemies from afar. Reinhart is known for his unconventional thinking and innovative magical techniques...and for his eccentricity, too."", '']","by

Built by a wealthy ship&#39;s captain, the expansive seaside estate was once home to a prominent local family, well-known for their philanthropy and for the sumptuous dinners they hosted for local society. Eventually, the home was converted to an inn by their eldest daughter, an avowed spinster who preferred the rigors of business to the comforts of marriage. In 1940 she opened The Driftwood Inn, and it quickly put the town of Seaside on the map, attracting families and dignitaries seeking a quiet and luxurious retreat by the ocean.', 'Over the years, the Inn has changed hands several times, ever maintaining its status as a premiere vacation destination, as well as Seaside&#39;s finest hotel and one of its architectural gems. The town&#39;s busy maritime, tourism, and retail sectors have all depended on the Driftwood to attract a sophisticated clientele to this little hamlet by the sea. More recently, however, the Inn has fallen on hard times. First a few flowers died off in the rose garden, then a raccoon took up residence in the attic, and before anyone knew what was happening, the cherished old inn had fallen into disrepair - and its reputation along with it.', 'Thankfully, the elderly inn-keeper had the good sense to hire Emma Gray, a spunky British lass, to manage the Inn&#39;s day-to-day operations. But by the time Emma arrived with her cat, Pris, in tow, there was nothing left to manage. Reservations had dried up and &#39;the old miss,&#39; as Emma calls her, soon put the place on the auction block, hoping to earn enough to retire. Now Emma is eager to get to work for her new employer: you! It&#39;s time to make the Driftwood your &#39;Dream Inn&#39; and restore it to its former glory as a favorite destination for travelers from all over the world.']","by

Officially announced on June 1, 2009, the game is the second main installment of the Crysis series, and is the sequel to the 2007 video game Crysis, and its expansion Crysis Warhead. The story was written by author Richard Morgan. Another science fiction author, Peter Watts, was also consulted and wrote a novel adaptation of the game. It was the first game to showcase the CryEngine 3 game engine. In Crysis 2 the player assumes the role of a Force Recon Marine called Alcatraz. Similar to its predecessor, it provides freedom to customize weaponry and abilities. Crytek wanted to avoid making another game set in a true jungle environment (as were Far Cry and Crysis); New York City has been dubbed an ""urban jungle"". The urban atmosphere offers new options with relation to progressing and planning attacks. Players are able to navigate between floors and buildings, as well as a destroyed cityscape. The Limited Edition of Crysis 2 is available at the same price as the regular game, but in limited quantities. It comes with bonus experience points to ""immediately boost the player up to Rank 5, giving access to all the preset class loadouts"", a digital camo weapon skin for the SCAR, the ""Hologram Decoy"" attachment for the SCAR, and unique in-game platinum dog tags. The Indian Version, on pre-order, also includes the Threat Tracer Suit Module (Early Access), and, on buying from the EA store, a gold dog tag and desert camo for SCAR.

Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement.
