Exclusive Q&A from PAX 2012 as he reflects on the 25th anniversary of the series.</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign=""top""><ul> <li><strong>If you could do an HD remake of any one of your titles, which one would it be, and why?</strong> <ul> <li>It would be METAL GEAR SOLID. If it was to be arranged in a contemporary way using the latest technology, I think it could result in something quite impressive. However, I don\'t want to be the one to recreate it.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Aside from releasing HD remakes of Metal Gear, what else do you have up your sleeve to help celebrate the 25th Anniversary of Metal Gear Solid?</strong> <ul> <li>We have trophy support for MGS4, a music CD, an anniversary book, a novel, figurines and toys, apparel items, and a variety of products related to METAL GEAR.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>If Snake didn\'t become as popular of a character in the Metal Gear Solid series, do you think you have gone another route, story-wise? Perhaps, using ""The Boss"", or even making the game where it had multiple character scenarios, perhaps, playing through the story of the Cobra Unit during World War II?</strong> <ul> <li>That may have well been a possibility. Instead of a saga centered on Snake, I may have written a story focused on the ""FOXHOUND"" members, similar as what was done in ""X-Men.""</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>You took a game, Metal Gear Solid, that wasn\'t originally supposed to even be an entire series, and you turned it into one of the most memorable stories ever seen in gaming. When WAS the ""Solid"" storyline originally supposed to end, and what would have been done differently?</strong> <ul> <li>I originally intended to end it with ""METAL GEAR SOLID."" That is the very reason why I introduced his ultimate enemy, ""Liquid Snake (clone),"" who possessed the same abilities as ""Solid Snake."" Had that not been the case, I wouldn\'t have utilized the stereotypical and difficult-to-manipulate character setting of a clone for a main character.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>How did you conceive such a magnificent storyline for this series of games? Where did you gather your inspiration from?</strong> <ul> <li>I believe that this is derived from the game design, story, and setting being handled by the same person. In comparison to movies or novels, there may be some elements that may fall short, however, I strove to build a world and story that worked well with the game.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>To Mr. Kojima, have you ever based any of the Metal Gear characters off of yourself and do you see yourself in any of the characters?</strong> <ul> <li>Not conciously, but ""Snake"" and I have come a long way together and so to some extent, a little bit of me is reflected in him. Like aging, for example.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Is there any chance of making a side story with Gray Fox playable ? He is the most memorable and dominant ninja ever to be seen on mgs series,Mgs community can\'t deny that.</strong> <ul> <li>Gray Fox\'s younger years is a theme that I\'d like to work on someday.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Have you ever thought of doing something related to Snatcher or Policenauts? Which Metal Gear game are you the most sastified with, and which are you the least sastified with?</strong> <ul> <li>I poured my all into the development of each title at the time and so I am satisfied. However, I can also say that at the same time, there is a part of me that will never be satisfied and that is the reason why I still make games to this day. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Which Metal Gear game are you the most sastified with and why? Could you share one of your favorite Metal Gear moments?</strong> <ul> <li>I would say ""METAL GEAR SOLID."" This was developed before the game made a name for itself and so I was able to freely create the game as I desired without pressure and being concerned about whether it would sell or not.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>We all got to Ocelot grow as a character throughout the MGS series, he definitely made the series. What character in the MGS franchise do you think potentially got overlooked?</strong> <ul> <li>That would be Colonel Campbell. It\'s easy to misinterpret him as a stereotypical military man, however he is actually a much more complex character. However, if I were to further flesh out Campbell, it would have been difficult to maintain the balance with the other characters and so I chose not to delve into that.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Whats your advice for someone who is trying to be a videogame designer for first steps ?</strong> <ul> <li>Future designers will be working with powerful hardware that possess varied means of expression. That is why more than anything else, direction and presentation skills for video, graphics, music, storytelling, etcetera, will be crucial. If one does not possess talent in that aspect, I believe it will be an uphill battle.<strong></strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>If you could design a Metal Gear title with a female-lead protagonist, what would she be like and what would separate her from other heroes/characters in other action titles with other titles that have a female lead?</strong> <ul> <li>A combat game featuring a frail female-lead would be difficult to deal with. However, a stong woman, such as The Boss, who exemplifies the unique maternal strengths that only a woman can possess, would make an interesting lead in a game.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>How much time has taken to make the current Fox Engine and is it closed to being completed?</strong> <ul> <li>It\'s come together and has made a certain degree of progress. Right now, we aren&rsquo;t making tech demos but are making a game that can actually be played as we polish up the engine&rsquo;s processing, displays, as well as the usability of the tools. I think we may have finally caught up to the rest of the world. From now, we plan on moving upwards to new heights. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Which is your favorite character from the Metal Gear saga, and why?</strong> <ul> <li>The number one spot would probably go to Snake, who has both matured and aged together with me. He started out as a 2D character that could not speak and then evolved into a fleshed out, 3D polygon character capable of speech and expressions, and he even developed wrinkles. Overall, he has beccome a more three-dimensional character in all respects.</li> </ul> </li> </ul></td> <td width=""330"" align=""center"" valign=""top""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/kojima.jpg"" width=""325"" height=""358"" alt=""Hideo Kojima""><br> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mg25th.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""151""></td> </tr> </table> </div>']","by

Wii</i>, like all the previous releases in the <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip down <i>Mario Bros.</i> memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote, <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> manages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer. <p/> <b>A Franchise First: Simultaneous Multiplayer</b><br/> Since the very first <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous \'player 2.\' Those days are no more. In <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> players can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-paced <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> fun. <p/> <b>Controller Choices Via the Wii Remote</b><br/> In another nod to the series\' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used with <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> is held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which is <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i>. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> offers a combination of cooperation and competition. Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.</li> <li>Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.</li> <li>Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.</li> <li>In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.</li> <li>New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.</li> <li>At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Forge a new path and live the legend with <i>Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker</i>, the first official Hideo Kojima game on the PSP system. <p/> <b>Mission-based Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker</i> is a tactical-stealth-action game based around mission based gameplay. Play in single player mode begins with a tutorial in which players square off against Snake himself which serves as a way to familiarize themselves with a control scheme that provides changes as well as improvements over those featured in earlier <i>MGS</i> titles for PSP. These cover both weapons and hand-to-hand combat. In addition, players also gain experience using the controls to chain together moves for maximum impact. Once through with the tutorial players embark on a series of missions, the replaying of which offers new enemy actions, as well as the possibility of new devices and tools. During combat players are able to target specific areas of an enemy\'s body and performance during each mission is ranked according to elapsed time, number of kills and other criteria. <p/> <b>4-player Co-op Multiplayer</b><br/> Along with a deep single player mode <i>Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker</i> contains exceptional multiplayer co-op functionality. Co-op action is facilitated via the PSP\'s local wireless ad-hoc connection and features different types of missions. Missions more dependent on stealth are limited to two-player games, while others--for example, boss battles--are meant for games of up to four players. Players have their choice of different versions of Snake. These not only possess differing appearance, but more importantly, differing strengths. During co-op play players can pull resources by staying within a minimal distance from each other This link is indicated by circles emanating around them. While maintaining this connection resources can be shared, including weapons, supplies and and overall health, indicated by a shared health bar. Players are able to view partner\'s inventory at a touch of the PSP\'s left or right face buttons, and when need be can resuscitate a fallen companion. When linked players can also move in unison by virtually tapping your partner\'s shoulder with a touch of the D-pad and then making your move. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>The Latest Title in the <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> Series</b> - A true continuation of the ever-evolving franchise that stood the test of time and started the stealth action genre, <i>Peace Walker</i> is the first title on the PSP system in which mastermind Hideo Kojima has fully taken up the reigns to direct, write, and design the game himself.</li> <li><b>Extensive Content</b> - Arguably one of the deepest PSP games to be released as Kojima Productions pushes the boundaries of the platform to new levels while blending various game styles together in ways that will captivate and engross both veterans and newcomers to <i>Metal Gear</i>.</li> <li><b>Proven Gameplay, Story, and More</b> - Fans of the series will enjoy the exhilaration of familiar stealth elements of previous <i>MGS</i> titles and will also be enticed by the new gameplay features making their debut in <i>Peace Walker</i>.

Platforming takes place between worlds, known as galaxies. Mario can move between smaller examples of these by jumping. He can also embark on longer jaunts via a small steerable planet in the shape of Mario\'s head, but as a new twist he can also move into and through planets as well using the new drill mechanism. This allows for both a new direction in action as well as an opening to problem-solving and coin collection. Players can expect the return of a variety of powerups from the original game including Bee and Boo Mushrooms, but also many that are new varieties including the Rock Mushroom that temporarily turns Mario into a rock that can smash through barriers. Another key change to gameplay is the ability for Mario to join with his pal Yoshi. Once Mario hatches Yoshi from his egg he can ride him through a variety of scenarios. Yoshi\'s particular reaction to specific powerups makes for fun with gravity. For example, when Yoshi eats a ""Dash Pepper"" he is able to move at hyper speed allowing the pair to literally run up the side of walls. Also, after eating a Blimp Fruit power-up Yoshi can swells up and floats like a blimp, taking Mario with him to areas of the game otherwise unreachable. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Mario collects stars as he travels from galaxy to galaxy. Every level is new, but the game retains the charm, sense of wonder and beauty in line with Mario\'s history. Mario works his way through the various levels, sometimes upside-down, sometimes floating from place to place.</li> <li>On some stages, Mario can find an egg, smash it open and hop onto the back of Yoshi. Yoshi can use his tongue to grab items and shoot them back at enemies, or to snag attach points and swing across chasms.</li> <li>Yoshi has an interesting diet. When he eats a Dash Pepper, he gets so hot and frenzied he can run up steep inclines and vertical walls.

Having traded her haunted past for the solitary life of a bounty hunter, Samus finally tells her own tale in this revealing, personal story of her failings, her flaws and ultimately her motivation. <i>Metroid: Other M</i> is an unprecedented collaboration that blends the slick, action-packed production of the world-renowned Team Ninja development team with the game design talents of the creators of the original <i>Metroid. Metroid: Other M</i> is a dramatic new direction for a legendary franchise and a bold new blend between cinematics, storytelling and the best in interactive entertainment. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><i>Metroid: Other M</i> takes the best elements of 1st-person and 3rd-person gaming to create a seamless blend between gameplay, storytelling and dynamic cinematography, that feels like a movie the player can control. Players hold the Wii Remote controller sideways while navigating and battling in 3rd-person. However, at any moment, players can switch immediately to Wii Remote pointer controls to examine and explore the environments in 1st-person perspective.</li> <li><i>Metroid</i> fans know more about Samus\' suits and weapons than they do about what drives her. That\'s about to change. The story begins immediately following the events of <i>Super Metroid</i>, when a baby Metroid gave its life to protect Samus. With voice acting and a rich story, players learn the engaging backstory of Samus as she weaves through an action-packed adventure aboard the Bottle Ship, a decommissioned space facility. As she hurtles into this new adventure, Samus will encounter her first mentor and Commanding Officer of the Galactic Federation, Adam Malkovich.</li> <li>The development of <i>Metroid: Other M</i> is an exciting collaboration between Nintendo\'s Yoshio Sakamoto and Team Ninja. Sakamoto was the director of <i>Super Metroid</i> in 1994. Team Ninja is the renowned action developer of <i>Ninja Gaiden</i>. <i>Metroid: Other M</i> pairs Sakamoto\'s expert level design and exploratory focus of the classic <i>Metroid</i> series with Team Ninja\'s signature stylish, no-holds-barred action.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Additional Screenshots</b>:<br/> <table cellspacing=""0"" align=""center""> <tr> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BSC4ZS.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""Samus taking on hordes of enemies in side-scrolling platforming action in Metroid: Other M"" title=""Samus taking on hordes of enemies in side-scrolling platforming action in Metroid: Other M"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BSC4ZS.04.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">1st &amp; 3rd person play options.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BSC4ZS.04.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BSC4ZS.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""Samus battling enemies in expansive environment in Metroid: Other M"" title=""Samus battling enemies in expansive environment in Metroid: Other M"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BSC4ZS.03.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Classic Metroid action.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BSC4ZS.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BSC4ZS.02.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""Samus interacting with other characters in Metroid: Other M"" title=""Samus interacting with other characters in Metroid: Other M"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BSC4ZS.02.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Beautiful in-game cinematics.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BSC4ZS.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BSC4ZS.05.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""Samus firing on enemies from a raised angle in Metroid: Other M"" title=""Samus firing on enemies from a raised angle in Metroid: Other M"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BSC4ZS.05.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">2D &amp; 3D puzzle-solving.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BSC4ZS.05.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

And with the addition of activities like Skateboarding and Rhythm Kung Fu, players will be using the Wii Balance Board accessory in a variety of new and fun ways. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> As with the original <i>Wii Fit</i> release, <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> is designed, as its name implies, to improve the user\'s fitness. The game contains a large number of activities that fall into a variety of categories, including: yoga, aerobics, strength training and balance games. With all but a few exceptions, which utilize variations on a standard Wii Remote configuration, all activities utilize the Wii Balance Board (not included, but available with the <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> Balance Board Bundle), either alone or configured with either a Wii Remote alone or the Wii Remote and nunchuck. The Balance Board, like any other Wii controller acts as a motion/pressure sensing device wirelessly synched to your Wii and replicating your body\'s movements. Each controller employed occupies one of the Wii\'s four wireless inputs, together mapping the reference points needed to recreate most full body motions on screen. Although this limits the majority of the activities to a single player orientation, various activities throughout the game support up to eight players in alternating play. <p/> To use <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> players import their Miis from their Wii system, set up profiles, establish a current physical baseline, set fitness goals, and embark on a routine to reach them. <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> tracks your usage, weight and progress towards your goal over time, giving you a status report as you start each session. At any time players can choose whatever activity they want, whether exercise or balance game, and as they progress in these they will level up in each, gaining points, setting high scores and unlocking more activities. <p/> <b>Personalization Option Via \'The Locker Room\'</b><br> The original <i>Wii Fit</i> was designed to have something for everyone. Now <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> raises the bar by providing users with personalization options that allow them to find/create a specific workout routine that is exactly right for them, their family and their lifestyle. One example of this is ""The Locker Room."" Easily accessible throughout the game, here players can choose from a number customizable options that allow them to maximize their time with <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> without having to navigate through the game menu while in the middle of a workout. In essence this allows players to become their own personal trainer. Customization options available within The Locker Room include: preprogrammed and timed <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> Routines; My Routine, where you choose your own set of activities, optimizing their length and area of the body to be focused on; and Favorites, a notation of activities you frequent, which provides fast access to exercises you enjoy doing the most. <p/> <b>Addition Yoga and Strength Exercises</b><br/> Designed as an addition to the already substantial list of focused, physical exercises available in <i>Wii Fit</i>, <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> contains six new and challenging strength and yoga activities. But continuing with the game\'s commitment to personalization, the key to these additions is not in their volume, but in how the player chooses to mix and match them. Do them in the order they are presented, or combine them in whatever order you want. The choice is yours. The player even has the ability to repeat the ones that he/she prefers, maximizing attention and effort where it is needed most. In addition, for those to whom time is a commodity, you can now omit unnecessary interludes between exercises, making for a continuous, timesaving routine. <p/> <b>A Wealth of New Balance Games</b><br/> Regardless of the considerable fitness factor packed into <i>Wii Fit Plus</i>, the Nintendo brand is and will always be all about having fun. With that in mind <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> also comes packed with 15 new, entertaining balance games suitable for every member of the family. Just a few of those that players can expect to see are: Juggling; Skateboarding; Snowball Fight; Obstacle Course, a log-leaping, cannonball-evading event reminiscent of what Nintendo icon Mario must go through; and Perfect 10, a balance game designed to promote a combination of physical and mental health. In this final example the player\'s Mii is situated between multiple color-coated balls, each showing specific numbers, with the goal to swing your hips, hula style, in different directions to tap out a total of ten as many times as possible before time runs out. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Users can input the amount of time they want to spend on their workouts or select an area for personal improvement, and <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> will suggest a number of diverse activities for them.</li> <li>For the first time, users can mix and match which strength and yoga activities they prefer on a given day. The seamless exercise flows make it easier than ever for users to maintain their daily workout routines.</li> <li>Users might be asked to run an obstacle course across a series of platforms, zoom across a beach on a Segway x2 Personal Transporter or flap their arms to help their hilarious chicken-suited characters aim for targets.</li> <li>The range of games and customization options will make players want to play every day. They&rsquo;ll be having so much fun that their workouts will seem to fly by in no time at all.</li> <li>Players also can see estimates of calories burned and can even activate a feature that lets them weigh their dogs or cats.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

And with the addition of activities like Skateboarding and Rhythm Kung Fu, players will be using the Wii Balance Board accessory in a variety of new and fun ways. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> As with the original <i>Wii Fit</i> release, <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> is designed, as its name implies, to improve the user\'s fitness. The game contains a large number of activities that fall into a variety of categories, including: yoga, aerobics, strength training and balance games. With all but a few exceptions, which utilize variations on a standard Wii Remote configuration, all activities utilize the Wii Balance Board (included with this bundle), either alone or configured with either a Wii Remote alone or the Wii Remote and nunchuck. The Balance Board, like any other Wii controller acts as a motion/pressure sensing device wirelessly synched to your Wii and replicating your body\'s movements. Each controller employed occupies one of the Wii\'s four wireless inputs, together mapping the reference points needed to recreate most full body motions on screen. Although this limits the majority of the activities to a single player orientation, various activities throughout the game support up to eight players in alternating play. <p/> To use <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> players import their Miis from their Wii system, set up profiles, establish a current physical baseline, set fitness goals, and embark on a routine to reach them. <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> tracks your usage, weight and progress towards your goal over time, giving you a status report as you start each session. At any time players can choose whatever activity they want, whether exercise or balance game, and as they progress in these they will level up in each, gaining points, setting high scores and unlocking more activities. <p/> <b>Personalization Option Via \'The Locker Room\'</b><br> The original <i>Wii Fit</i> was designed to have something for everyone. Now <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> raises the bar by providing users with personalization options that allow them to find/create a specific workout routine that is exactly right for them, their family and their lifestyle. One example of this is ""The Locker Room."" Easily accessible throughout the game, here players can choose from a number customizable options that allow them to maximize their time with <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> without having to navigate through the game menu while in the middle of a workout. In essence this allows players to become their own personal trainer. Customization options available within The Locker Room include: preprogrammed and timed <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> Routines; My Routine, where you choose your own set of activities, optimizing their length and area of the body to be focused on; and Favorites, a notation of activities you frequent, which provides fast access to exercises you enjoy doing the most. <p/> <b>Addition Yoga and Strength Exercises</b><br/> Designed as an addition to the already substantial list of focused, physical exercises available in <i>Wii Fit</i>, <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> contains six new and challenging strength and yoga activities. But continuing with the game\'s commitment to personalization, the key to these additions is not in their volume, but in how the player chooses to mix and match them. Do them in the order they are presented, or combine them in whatever order you want. The choice is yours. The player even has the ability to repeat the ones that he/she prefers, maximizing attention and effort where it is needed most. In addition, for those to whom time is a commodity, you can now omit unnecessary interludes between exercises, making for a continuous, timesaving routine. <p/> <b>A Wealth of New Balance Games</b><br/> Regardless of the considerable fitness factor packed into <i>Wii Fit Plus</i>, the Nintendo brand is and will always be all about having fun. With that in mind <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> also comes packed with 15 new, entertaining balance games suitable for every member of the family. Just a few of those that players can expect to see are: Juggling; Skateboarding; Snowball Fight; Obstacle Course, a log-leaping, cannonball-evading event reminiscent of what Nintendo icon Mario must go through; and Perfect 10, a balance game designed to promote a combination of physical and mental health. In this final example the player\'s Mii is situated between multiple color-coated balls, each showing specific numbers, with the goal to swing your hips, hula style, in different directions to tap out a total of ten as many times as possible before time runs out. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>The <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> Bundle includes the game software and the Wii Balance Board.</li> <li>Users can input the amount of time they want to spend on their workouts or select an area for personal improvement, and <i>Wii Fit Plus</i> will suggest a number of diverse activities for them.</li> <li>For the first time, users can mix and match which strength and yoga activities they prefer on a given day. The seamless exercise flows make it easier than ever for users to maintain their daily workout routines.</li> <li>Users might be asked to run an obstacle course across a series of platforms, zoom across a beach on a Segway x2 Personal Transporter or flap their arms to help their hilarious chicken-suited characters aim for targets.</li> <li>The range of games and customization options will make players want to play every day. They&rsquo;ll be having so much fun that their workouts will seem to fly by in no time at all.</li> <li>Players also can see estimates of calories burned and can even activate a feature that lets them weigh their dogs or cats.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

In the first episode, an argument in Edgeworth\'s office results in a mysterious murder. Edgeworth, coming back from a one-month business trip, enters his office and encounters the body of the man who was shot. In the second episode, Edgeworth\'s plane journey takes a nasty turn when he wakes up after being knocked out during heavy turbulence. Shaken by the flashback of nightmarish past memories, he opens the onboard elevator\'s door to find a male corpse. At this very moment a cabin attendant witnesses the scene and Edgeworth is made a suspect of murder. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Like Capcom\'s <i>Phoenix Wright</i> games, <i>Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth</i> is designed around the point-and-click game mechanic, with the player taking on a series of cases placed before them. Playing as Miles Edgeworth, players get to the bottom of cases by collecting information and evidence through detective work between key locations. These locations must be physically explored, with players given the choice of either the DS stylus or the D-pad to to facilitate movement, and collect clues. Within the game\'s \'Logic\' mode, which symbolizes Edgeworth\'s logical inferences, users can discover new information and evidence by combining clues discovered in the action portion of the game. Eventually, with the discovery of the right clues the real culprit will be revealed through these investigations and the confrontation of witnesses to expose contradictions in a \'battle\' mechanism (Testimony - Pursuit - Press - Confront), which is similar to that of the \'Court Battle\' in the Ace Attorney series (Testimony - Cross Examination). <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Starring Miles Edgeworth, the popular rival of attorney Phoenix Wright.</li> <li>Gameplay moves out of the courtroom and onto the crime scene.</li> <li>Several unique cases to solve with over 15 hours of gameplay.</li> <li>New technique, such as ""Logic"" mode assists you in uncovering the crime.</li> <li>Unique dialog trees and interrogation techniques let you question witnesses to discover the truth.</li> <li>New action game component that allows for exploration of crime scenes using either D-Pad inputs of the DS/DSi stylus to uncover clues.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Additional Screenshots</b>:<br/> <table cellspacing=""0"" align=""center""> <tr> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BS4834.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;""><img alt=""Miles Edgeworth and sidekick Gumshoe in Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth"" title=""Miles Edgeworth and sidekick Gumshoe in Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BS4834.02.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Interrogate witnesses.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BS4834.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BS4834.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;""><img alt=""Characters exploring a crime scene in Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth"" title=""Characters exploring a crime scene in Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BS4834.04.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Explore crime scenes.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BS4834.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BS4834.05.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;""><img alt=""Searching a dead body for clues in Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth"" title=""Searching a dead body for clues in Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BS4834.05.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Search for clues.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BS4834.05.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BS4834.03.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;""><img alt=""Building usable evidence from previously found clues in Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth"" title=""Building usable evidence from previously found clues in Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BS4834.03.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Develop clues into evidence.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002BS4834.03.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Monster Hunter Tri</i> is an action RPG centered around players\' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion. <p/> <b>Co-op Multiplayer</b><br/> Utilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii, <i>Monster Hunter Tri</i> allows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore the <i>Monster Hunter</i> world, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player\'s death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support. <p/> <b>Multiple Controller Support</b><br/> <i>Monster Hunter Tri</i> features a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Hunt Together</b> - In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.</li> <li><b>Communicate Online</b> - Because communication is key in coordinated hunts <i>Monster Hunter Tri</i> supports Wii Speak and text chat.</li> <li><b>Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks</b> - Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses.

Unlike previous versions whose primary means of playing media was via a built-in Universal Media Disc (UMD) drive, the PSP Go does away with UMDs altogether and instead relies on a media solution combining download functionality via Sony\'s PlayStation Network, larger onboard storage capacity and removable Memory Stick Duo support. This major change allows for a slim design, quicker access files and a much more quiet, energy efficient gaming experience since there are no longer any spinning UMDs. <p/> Other major changes include: Bluetooth support, allowing Internet Skype calls to now be made using compatible headsets; and more importantly, a change to the control scheme. The PSP Go features convenient slide out controls. Although these are consistent with historical PSP controls--featuring four directional arrows, the four familiar Sony face buttons and a left-oriented analog thumbstick--their ability to be placed out of view when not in use allows the PSP Go to maximize the use of its screen and your viewing pleasure. <p/> <b>A Full Entertainment System in Your Hands</b><br/> The PSP was designed to handle all varieties of applications and entertainment -- music, video, communication, wireless networking, and, of course, gaming. PSP Go users will enjoy topnotch 3D games with high-quality, full-motion video, and high-fidelity audio. Its ultra-crisp 3.8-inch wide screen LCD display is bright and beautiful, and works well under many different lighting conditions. <p/> <b>A Wealth of Games to Choose From</b><br/> The PlayStation Portable gaming library is hundreds of titles strong and covers a wide variety of genres. The PSP Go is compatible with all PSP formatted games and Sony has pledged to have all these available for download via the PlayStation Network\'s PlayStation Store. Whether you are seeking the hard knocks of football or other sports games, the strategy of a puzzle games, or the action and adventure of shooters and racers, there\'s sure to be many games in your future with the PSP Go.

Players assume the role of four new ""Survivors,"" each with their own personality and new dialog. The game leads these ""Survivors"" through the southeastern region of the US - from Savannah, Georgia through the bayou country, and climaxing in New Orleans&rsquo; French Quarter. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Just as with the original <i>Left 4 Dead</i>, <i>Left 4 Dead 2</i> is a first-person shooter which pits players against hordes of zombie-like enemies. As you would expect in a scenario where you are regularly surrounded by masses of the undead, it is very good thing to have plenty of help, as well as weapons at your disposal, and <i>Left 4 Dead 2</i> has players covered on both accounts. The game features several multiplayer options including 2-8 player online and offline support in several modes seen in the first game, including Campaign, Versus, and Survival, as well as the new Scavenge Mode. This new multiplayer option tasks players, in the role of survivors to find a limited number of fuel canisters hidden in a level in order to keep their individual generators going, while other players in the role of the infected try to stop them. In addition the game features very strong co-op play support, with 2-player support locally and 2-4 player support online. <p/> The game features a wealth of melee weapons and additional items handy for battling enemies up-close and personal.

Preparations are underway in Hobbiton for a great party to welcome the legendary Aragorn, now king of the united lands of Arnor and Gondor, and to honor Samwise Gamgee for his service during the War of the Ring. With Aragorn&rsquo;s visit to the Shire imminent, Sam&rsquo;s children are eager to learn more about this great man and so Sam, now Mayor of Hobbiton, embarks on a tale of the revered warrior, Aragorn, and the valiant deeds that transformed a Ranger of the North, into the last great king of men in Middle-earth. <p/> <table align=right width=300 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td valign=""top"" height=""353""> <div align=""center""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aragorns.quest.01.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""Aragorn ready with sword and shield in The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn\'s Quest"" title=""Aragorn ready with sword and shield in The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn\'s Quest"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aragorns.quest.01.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""300"" height=""293""></a><br> </div> <center> <span class=""caption"">Relive the great deeds of Aragorn during the War of the Ring as told by Sam Gamgee.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/aragorns.quest.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn\'s Quest</i> is an action-adventure game designed to allow young players to relive the great battles and events featured in J.R.R Tolkien\'s ""The Lord of the Rings"".

Just one aspect of this is NBA Today, in which all the real world matchups, news and stats are automatically streamed right into your game providing dynamic commentary and presentation elements based upon what is happening in the real NBA. <p/> <b>My Player Mode</b><br/> My Player Mode is perhaps the most exciting new feature built into <i>NBA 2K10</i>. Instead of focusing on over all team status, My Player Mode is a career mode, allowing players at home create the ultimate NBA player from the ground, up and guide his every career move. Start as an undrafted rookie in the Summer Leagues, where you specify every aspect of your character\'s game and physical makeup. Work hard enough throughout the series of games played here, gathering enough experience points along the way to build the skills your player needs at his position and you may get an invite to participate in an NBA team&rsquo;s training camp. And if you don\'t make the cut, not to worry there is always the D-League, where you can work more on your game until you get your next shot.

Just one aspect of this is NBA Today, in which all the real world matchups, news and stats are automatically streamed right into your game providing dynamic commentary and presentation elements based upon what is happening in the real NBA. <p/> <b>My Player Mode</b><br/> My Player Mode is perhaps the most exciting new feature built into <i>NBA 2K10</i>. Instead of focusing on over all team status, My Player Mode is a career mode, allowing players at home create the ultimate NBA player from the ground, up and guide his every career move. Start as an undrafted rookie in the Summer Leagues, where you specify every aspect of your character\'s game and physical makeup. Work hard enough throughout the series of games played here, gathering enough experience points along the way to build the skills your player needs at his position and you may get an invite to participate in an NBA team&rsquo;s training camp. And if you don\'t make the cut, not to worry there is always the D-League, where you can work more on your game until you get your next shot. Either way, the road to being an NBA star is a long and hard battle full of challenges. <p/> <b>Crews</b><br/> Basketball is a team sport, and <i>NBA 2K10</i> acknowledges this with its Crew functionality. Round up your friends and build the ultimate squad, using either your created players from My Player mode or an actual NBA team, then go online and battle other Crews for bragging rights and progression points as you try to climb your way to the top of the Crew leaderboard rankings. <p/> <b>Living Rosters</b><br/> The 2K Insider and his team of NBA analysts continue to keep <i>NBA 2K10</i> fresh with up-to-date team and player information, including roster and lineup moves, trades, injuries and player ratings. Now track all of the changes through the season with interactive menus and analysis. <p/> <b>Seamless Online Experience</b><br/> Forget the past, with <i>NBA 2K10</i> online play is fully incorporated into every mode of the game. Now you can play the AI, challenge the friend sitting next to you or play your buddy across town anytime, from anywhere in the game. The game features 1-4 player support in versus and coop play locally and 2-10 player support in versus and coop play online with up to a full five man roster on each side. <p/> <b>Signature Play</b><br/> Signature Play pulls together all of <i>NBA 2K</i>&rsquo;s player Signature Styles and adds in all-new Signature Tendencies and facial expressions, creating <i>NBA 2K10</i> teams that play and react like their real life counterparts for an unbelievably realistic NBA experience. <p/> <b>New Intuitive Offensive Controls</b><br/> All-new easy-to-use dribbling and post game controls allow you to pull off ankle breaking ISO-Motion moves and dominate like Kobe from the perimeter to the paint. <p/> <b>Shut Down D</b><br/> Every NBA star knows that offense is flashy, but defense wins championships. With this in mind <i>NBA 2K10</i> gives you the opportunity to show your stuff at both ends of the court. Shut down teams like never before with innovative defensive controls that allow you to shadow your opponent&rsquo;s every move, deny position off-ball, and even select how you want to contest shots. </td> </tr> </table>']","by

During the First World War a new breed of warrior emerged, reminiscent of the Knights of old, inspired by chivalry and pushed to their limits by modern technology, they fought a new kind of war an air war. Welcome to Rise of Flight: The First Great Air War. In flying machines invented just a few years before, young, brave and daring fighter pilots took to the skies to fight for their countrys cause. In airplanes made of mostly wood and canvas they climbed, dived, spiraled and sacrificed their lives. The average pilot lasted just 17 missions and if you were hit there was no parachute to rescue you. Death could come at any time and from any direction, only the best survived. Rise of Flight puts you in the cockpit, in the sky and in the fight. Do you have what it takes to survive? Can you make a difference in the war? Can you become an Ace Fighter Pilot? Rise of Flight from Russian developer neoqb is a state-of-the-art PC flight simulation title that sets a new standard in fidelity, beauty and realism. You can fly either the agile Spad XIII or the deadly Fokker D. VII into aerial combat. Rise of Flight features an advanced flight model that simulates the unique handling characteristics of WWI biplanes. Spins, stalls, loops, takeoffs and landings are all accurately modeled. A complex physics model tracks the trajectory of every bullet and shell fragment. The detailed damage model leaves no room for error. Stay in the line of fire too long and youll lose a wing or a tail, land too hard and the spine of your plane will crack.']","by

Now four characters, each following their own leads and with their own motives, must take part in a desperate attempt to prevent the killer from taking yet another life. <p/> <table align=right width=220 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td height=""194""> <div align=""center""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.01.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""Shaun and Ethan Mars from Heavy Rain"" title=""Shaun and Ethan Mars from Heavy Rain"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.01.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""300"" height=""222""></a><br> </div> <center> <span class=""caption"">Discover how far you will go to protect a loved one as you join the search for the Origami Killer.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Heavy Rain</i> is a single player, action/adventure game with a particularly strong emphasis on a player-influenced storyline as a means of facilitating the evolution of action towards one of many possible conclusions. The game features four playable characters: a father, a photographer, a FBI agent with a special skill set and a retired cop turned private detective. Each have different paths, means and motives to ending the reign of terror that the Origami Killer has imposed on their city. As players follow the path laid before their character of choice, they are able to explore, interact with and view their surroundings in a variety of ways using their controller\'s left and right sticks. At crucial times players are given a series of choices relating to how to proceed in various situations, with the outcome of these choices revealing both benefits and consequences. Benefits can be important to progressing through the game, while possible consequences can in turn pose a very real danger to characters, including death. But unlike other games, and because <i>Heavy Rain</i> features four playable characters that exist independently of each other, yet simultaneously within the same the story arc, this does not end the game. Players are instead able to play as one of the other available characters, with appropriate changes to possible outcomes due to the absence of the deceased character(s). <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>An evolving action-adventure thriller in which you shape the story with every decision you make.</li> <li>Action built around four playable characters that allows you to continue playing as one of the other characters if your initial character is killed.</li> <li>Savable chapters that allow you to replay the actions of the past, while maintaining the continuity of the events begun in earlier chapters.</li> <li>Mature content reflecting a realistic world setting that explores powerful themes.</li> <li>Stunning graphics, animation and technology that support an emotionally driven experience.</li> <li>Accessible gameplay via intuitive, contextual controls and interface.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Additional Screenshots</b>:<br/> <table cellspacing=""0"" align=""center""> <tr> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""Private detective Scott Shelby looking over evidence and packing heat in Heavy Rain"" title=""Private detective Scott Shelby looking over evidence and packing heat in Heavy Rain"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.02.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">4 unique playable characters.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""FBI agent Norman Jayden working a crime scene in Heavy Rain."" title=""FBI agent Norman Jayden working a crime scene in Heavy Rain"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.04.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Advanced crime scene analysis.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""Scott Shelby debating whether to interfere in a robbery in Heavy Rain"" title=""Scott Shelby debating whether to interfere in a robbery in Heavy Rain"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.03.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Story influencing actions.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.05.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""Troubled photographer Madison Paige from Heavy Rain"" title=""Troubled photographer Madison Paige from Heavy Rain"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.05.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Stunning graphics quality.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002CZ38KA.05.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

The game\'s main campaign, known as Stepping Mode, exists in an area known as ""Rhythm Island"", can be played in single player or local two-player simultaneous and challenges players to explore a gameworld that grows with every literal step taken through it. These steps are patterned after the rhythm of the songs of the in-game soundtrack, which are tapped/stepped out using the game controllers supported. These include the Wii Remote/Nunchuk, the Wii Balance Board and the <i>DDR</i> controller for Wii. Tracks are of various speed and tempo, which the player can alter through difficulty settings. The game features a moving indicator line, known as the ""Stepping Guide"" that helps players keep in tune with the beat, and the displaying of lyrics, which for some can be helpful in keeping in time, can also be suspended as the player chooses. As players walk in synch they are rewarded with in-game chips, depending on their level of accuracy. These chips can in turn be used to unlock ""Event Capsules"", which hold a variety of elements ranging from new songs, new paths through the gameworld and physical environmental features like zodiac constellations and rainbows. The unlocking/purchasing of events can happen as the user pauses the action to do so, or can be cued to happen as the required chips are collected. Additional features include: character customization and Mii support, your choice of a male or female AI companion, in-game song set lists, map functionality and varied camera controls for improved Event Capsule searching. <p/> <b>Mini-Games</b><br/> Along with moving through the main campaign found within the <i>Walk It Out!</i> Stepping Mode, players also have the option to take a break and play a range of entertaining mini-games, some of which involve walking and some not. These include: <ol><i>Whack-A-Slack!</i><br/> A take off on the iconic game <i>Whack-A-Mole</i>, here players try to hit as many of the ""Slackie"" creatures as possible with an in-game mallet, within the parameters chosen for the game. Multiple difficulty settings are available and play is possible during a single run-through of an unlocked song or set list, or by letting the song(s) loop and play as long as you like. </ol> <ol><i>Psycolo</i><br/> <i>Psycolo</i> is a puzzle game in which you use your ability to walk to the beat to move a cube around a gameboard collecting hearts and avoiding Slackies, all while maintaining your on-screen health through accuracy in play. The game features 3 ways to move your cube. </ol> <ol><i>Smash &lsquo;n Run!</i><br/> Another nod to <i>Whack-A-Mole</i>, <i>Smash &lsquo;n Run!</i> again has players looking to drop the hammer on Slackies. The difference here is that players need the right size hammer, if not Slackies can fight back and drain your life. This game also incorporates the Wii Remote/Nunchuk controller configuration with your choice of <i>DDR</i> mat or Wii Balance Board controllers. </ol> <p/> <b>Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Uniquely Motivational Gameplay</b> - Stay active and explore an in-game world where the more you move, the richer your gameworld becomes. Unlockable areas and music tracks tied to the in-game time of day ensure the discovery of new items and goodies every time you play.</li> <li><b>Music to Get You Going</b> - <i>Walk It Out!</i> is the only fitness-focused game that keeps you in the game with great music. Move to the beat of 120 songs, including 20 licensed tracks, including masters performed by the original artists. Hits include: ""Boom Boom Pow"" by the Black Eyed Peas, ""How Do You Sleep?"" by Jesse McCartney, ""La La Land"" by Demi Lovato, and more.</li> <li><b>Track Your Achievements</b> - Get a visual feel for how well you\'re doing through charts and graphs that show burned calories, distance traveled, steps taken and more.</li> <li><b>Wii Balance Board Compatible</b> - Play with the peripheral of your choice, including the <i>DanceDanceRevolution</i> Wii controller, Wii Remote and Nunchuk or Wii Balance Board.</li> <li><b>Mini-game Fun</b> - Along with exploring and unlocking the <i>Walk It Out!</i> gameworld, players can also engage in a series of mini-games at any time. These include: Whack-A-Slack!, Psycolo and Smash &lsquo;n Run!.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Fighting your way through a series of story driving quests and optional side adventures, players have the freedom of choice needed to build their party, as well as their choice of a variety of character classes, including fighter, mage, priest, thief, and bard as they customize their own character. The game can be played in single player mode locally, where the player teams up with AI characters, or a two-player co-op mode online that lets you battle your way across Eldar with friends from all over the world. Action within the game\'s storyline is split between two player controlled characters set within different time periods, as the player\'s initial character eventually marries, has children and passes the quest to save Eldar on to his/her progeny. Combat in quests occurs in real-time, meaning that enemies are always viewable. This makes for both more exciting action, and if the player chooses, the ability to keep out of an enemy\'s path and thus bypass conflict or at the least put it off until a more opportune time. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Multi-generational Storyline</b> - The player starts off as a human that seeks to reconcile and rebuild old alliances with the dwarves, halflings, and elves.

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Lost Planet 2</i>, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures.

There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay in <i>Lost Planet</i> a true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>4-player Co-op Action</b> - Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play.

Since colonial times it has served as a melting pot, but recently more than just the ""huddled masses yearning to breath free"" have established a foothold in the Big Apple. Along with peoples and influences from all over the world it has also accumulated masses of relics and artifacts not meant to exist in proximity to each other, resulting in malignant energies from the past. But New Yorkers are not alone in the coming struggle. The Star Division has long battled such forces around the world, and now they have come to the New World. Officially titled the New York Combat Revue, Star Division, this diverse group of covert operatives uses their front as an all female troupe of Broadway performers headquartered at the Littlelip Theater as a front to protect the people of the city. The latest member to join the team from the Tokyo branch is Shinjiro Taiga. Being a young man, he is not quite what the other members of Stars Division expected and as such must prove himself, but filled with hopes and dreams he is determined to fight for justice. To be successful he will have to build relationships within his new team and learn to fight with them. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Sakura Wars: So Long My Love</i> is a strategy RPG. Gameplay is split between two modes: Adventure Mode and Battle Mode. In Adventure Mode Shinjiro explores the Littlelip Theater and greater New York City, interacting with other members of the Star Division and various other characters in a variety of ways, including timed and untimed dialog and action selections and on-screen manipulations using controller analog sticks. In addition, players take part in events such as Broadway shows. Depending on your interactions with team members, their ""Trust"" in you will change. If this change is positive the player will form ""Bonds"" with the respective team member, which will affect skills, abilities and possibilities in battle. <p/> Battle Mode features a strategic real-time RPG battle system in which players control up to six team members in ground and aerial combat with the goal of destroying enemies. Ground combat takes place using mechanized suits referred to as STARS (Super Telekinetic Assault Robots). Every STARS unit in the game can transform from a battle mech into a jet fighter during combat, depending on the situation. Once transformed, weapons and movement methods will change accordingly. For example, the hero&rsquo;s ground mode utilizes a sword as his main weapon, but in jet mode he will use long-range missiles. In coordinating attacks with team members players can adopt differing strategies which utilize fluctuating amounts of mobility, hit points and healing abilities. Each character also has access to unique Super Attacks that can be unleashed. Focused joint attacks can also be enacted by two or more characters which have built sufficient bonds between them in Adventure Mode. Additional features available include the ability to take, save and collect in-game photos, hidden secret events and a quiz game. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Premium Edition includes: game version for PlayStation 2, an artbook, poster and limited edition packaging.</li> <li>Anime-style storytelling featuring tons of anime movie scenes and dual voice-over (English/Japanese).</li> <li>Adventure Mode allowing the player to explore New York City and build relationship with in-game AI teammates.</li> <li>A strategy RPG battle system allowing for coordinated control of a team of diverse female fighters, each operating Mech battlesuits that can fight both on the ground and in the air.</li> <li>High replay value through the various different endings possible,each of which hinges on the bonds created between characters in-game.</li> <li>Additional in-game activities and functionality including Broadway performances with AI Stars teammates., in-game photo functionality, secret events and a quiz game.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Additional Screenshots</b>:<br/> <table cellspacing=""0"" align=""center""> <tr> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sakura.wars.slml.02.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=659,height=468\'); return false;""><img alt=""Chatting up Cheiron Weinberg in Sakura Wars: So Long My Love"" title=""Chatting up Cheiron Weinberg in Sakura Wars: So Long My Love"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sakura.wars.slml.02.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Build bonds with teammates.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sakura.wars.slml.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=659,height=468\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sakura.wars.slml.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=659,height=468\'); return false;""><img alt=""Ground-based Mech combat in Sakura Wars: So Long My Love"" title=""Ground-based Mech combat in Sakura Wars: So Long My Love"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sakura.wars.slml.03.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Ground &amp; Air based combat.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sakura.wars.slml.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=659,height=468\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sakura.wars.slml.05.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=659,height=468\'); return false;""><img alt=""Gemini Sunrise and her mech in Sakura Wars: So Long My Love"" title=""Gemini Sunrise and her mech in Sakura Wars: So Long My Love"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sakura.wars.slml.05.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Character specific mechs.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sakura.wars.slml.05.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=659,height=468\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GW2.01.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=695,height=585\'); return false;""><img alt=""Sakura Wars: So Long My Love Premium Edition contents"" title=""Sakura Wars: So Long My Love Premium Edition contents"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GW2.01.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Premium Edition extras.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GW2.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=695,height=585\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Meiktilia has been said to bless two types of people with special gifts, Blades who have ultimate and supernatural skill needed to destroy the physical structure of things and Sealers who use magical abilities to destroy the metaphysical structure of things. Conversely, the god Formival\'s remarkable power allows all things, once dead, to revive. Under his influence the original souls of creatures facing death escape their bodies, which are in turn controlled by a fragment of Formival\'s soul. Imbued with a divine but malignant spark, these beings, known as Belzeds, become monsters, growing stronger if not checked. Only the destruction of their physical and metaphysical selves, requiring the power of both a Blade and a Sealer, can truly destroy them. Due to a protracted civil war, the Kingdom of Lorvin has become infested with Belzeds. Knowing the weakness of the Belzed\'s duality, the king of Lorvin, Arzelide, has summoned Nine Asfel, the most powerful of Blades and Aisha Romandine, a beautiful but frighteningly powerful Sealer, to make a final stand. But they must work together if Lorvin is to survive. <p/> <table align=right width=300 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td height=""219"" valign=""top""> <div align=""center""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.01.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=719,height=557\'); return false;""><img alt=""Nine and Aisha from Last Rebellion"" title=""Nine and Aisha from Last Rebellion"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.01.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""300"" height=""230""></a><br> </div> <center> <span class=""caption"">Merge the destructive powers of the Blade and the Sealer in Last Rebellion.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=719,height=557\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Last Rebellion</i> is a single player, turn-based RPG. Centered around the elimination of the physical and metaphysical components that make up the Belzed threat, the game\'s battle system allows the player to control the team of Nine and Aisha, and in fact toggle between the two. A turn consists of actions by both characters. Because each has specific strengths, and specific enemies are more susceptible to attacks in certain orders, players decide which character of their duo strikes first. In dealing with enemies the player uses a combination of sword strokes and magic, with attacks being initiated and maintained across multiple turns using what is referred to as the ""Attack and Stamp"" method. As a specific body part(s) of an enemy(s) is engaged with sword strokes, symbols known as ""Stamps"" appear over that area. Initiating attacks on body parts uses chain points, which are provided in limited numbers to the player. Stamps serve as a homing beacon for further magic attacks, which can thereafter be unleashed on multiple stamped spots simultaneously. Each enemy type is susceptible to attacks made in certain orders. Chain points can be budgeted by memorization of these attack orders and the various weak spots of enemies. Bingo and combo points are rewarded for targeting weak spots in the right order, and doing so in consecutive attacks respectively. Once physically defeated magic points can be extracted from Belzed enemies, with players also building into their turn a sealing attack by Aisha to eliminate the Belzed\'s regeneration ability. If this is not done Belzeds will revive, stronger than ever. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>A PlayStation 3 exclusive, featuring classic turn-based RPG action.</li> <li>Two main characters that players can toggle between in combat.</li> <li>Tactical battle system utilizing the strengths of both characters and allowing for the tagging of enemies for focused combat across multiple turns.</li> <li>A combination of dual wielding sword and magic combat.</li> <li>Gorgeous watercolor-like character art and event scenes.</li> <li>An engaging story of revenge featuring a dark anti-hero.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Additional Screenshots</b>:<br/> <table cellspacing=""0"" align=""center""> <tr> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.02.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=451\'); return false;""><img alt=""Nine dual wielding in Last Rebellion"" title=""Nine dual wielding in Last Rebellion"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.02.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Sword and magic combat.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=451\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=451\'); return false;""><img alt=""Nine getting chased by a big baddie in Last Rebellion"" title=""Nine getting chased by a big baddie in Last Rebellion"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.03.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">A variety of Belzed enemies.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=451\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=451\'); return false;""><img alt=""Nine setting stamps on specific enemy body parts in Last Rebellion"" title=""Nine setting stamps on specific enemy body parts in Last Rebellion"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.04.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">A tag based battle system.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=451\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.05.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=451\'); return false;""><img alt=""Aisha getting ready to lay some magic on two Belzeds with multiple tags each in Last Rebellion"" title=""Aisha getting ready to lay some magic on two Belzeds with multiple tags each in Last Rebellion"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.05.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">2 ability-specific characters.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002DC8GRC.05.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=451\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Since colonial times it has served as a melting pot, but recently more than just the ""huddled masses yearning to breath free"" have established a foothold in the Big Apple. Along with peoples and influences from all over the world it has also accumulated masses of relics and artifacts not meant to exist in proximity to each other, resulting in malignant energies from the past. But New Yorkers are not alone in the coming struggle. The Star Division has long battled such forces around the world, and now they have come to the New World. Officially titled the New York Combat Revue, Star Division, this diverse group of covert operatives uses their front as an all female troupe of Broadway performers headquartered at the Littlelip Theater as a front to protect the people of the city. The latest member to join the team from the Tokyo branch is Shinjiro Taiga. Being a young man, he is not quite what the other members of Stars Division expected and as such must prove himself, but filled with hopes and dreams he is determined to fight for justice. To be successful he will have to build relationships within his new team and learn to fight with them. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Sakura Wars: So Long My Love</i> is a strategy RPG. Gameplay is split between two modes: Adventure Mode and Battle Mode. In Adventure Mode Shinjiro explores the Littlelip Theater and greater New York City, interacting with other members of the Star Division and various other characters in a variety of ways, including timed and untimed dialog and action selections and on-screen manipulations using controller analog sticks. In addition, players take part in events such as Broadway shows. Depending on your interactions with team members, their ""Trust"" in you will change. If this change is positive the player will form ""Bonds"" with the respective team member, which will affect skills, abilities and possibilities in battle. <p/> Battle Mode features a strategic real-time RPG battle system in which players control up to six team members in ground and aerial combat with the goal of destroying enemies. Ground combat takes place using mechanized suits referred to as STARS (Super Telekinetic Assault Robots). Every STARS unit in the game can transform from a battle mech into a jet fighter during combat, depending on the situation. Once transformed, weapons and movement methods will change accordingly. For example, the hero&rsquo;s ground mode utilizes a sword as his main weapon, but in jet mode he will use long-range missiles. In coordinating attacks with team members players can adopt differing strategies which utilize fluctuating amounts of mobility, hit points and healing abilities. Each character also has access to unique Super Attacks that can be unleashed. Focused joint attacks can also be enacted by two or more characters which have built sufficient bonds between them in Adventure Mode.

When an average housewife in Nerima, Japan, was murdered in a grisly fashion, it gave rise to a curse so powerful that it threatens to kill at a pace thought unimaginable before. The curse manifests on those who encounter the curse by any means, such as entering the house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed. Once Erika Yamada is exposed to the curse while searching for her dog in an abandoned warehouse, the entire Yamada family is put in grave danger as soon as she reunites with them at home. They must now face their individual challenges alone, and only by overcoming the curse together will their family truly be free again. JU-ON: The Grudge is billed as the first Haunted House Simulator where accessibility and instant scares are given priority over story and game play depth. Using the Wii Remote as a flashlight, players move forward with the touch of a button and explore haunted areas such as an abandoned warehouse, a dimly-lit hospital, and a mannequin factory. Much like a haunted house, the player must proceed forward even after being frightened.']","by

Yet <i>Hottest Party 3</i> for Wii sets itself apart from previous versions in this by including new input methods. The game bundle includes the familiar <i>DDR</i> floor peripheral for registering dance steps, which make up the majority of the game actions, and like earlier <i>DDR</i> versions for Wii, also includes Wii Remote and nunchuck support. What is new is the game\'s Wii Balance board integration. The balance board is an optional accessory (sold separately), and allows for a whole new way to play in workout mode among others. The game also features 2-player local versus multiplayer support, Mii integration and new costume customization functionality and new game modes. <p/> <b>Song List</b><br/> <i>Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 3</i> is backed by a massive list of 50 foot-stompng songs and remixes to move your body to.

A young, confident and skilled hunter and outdoorsman, his potential has been recognized by the mysterious ""Orion Order,"" an ultra-exclusive hunting club with international connections. Even though Jack is still green, the powers that be at Orion are willing to give him a shot at joining, but first he must prove himself worthy. Jack jumps at this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. His test is made up of a series of membership trials against big game and small, in various environments and conditions and utilizing a variety of weapons, skills and techniques. <p/> <b>Top Shot Wii Peripheral Included</b><br/> <i>Cabela\'s Big Game Hunter 2010</i> Wii Bundle brings even more fun to the hunt with its inclusion of the Top Shot Wii peripheral. Made out of rugged but light bright orange plastic, the Top Shot accessory will never be mistaken for a real gun away from the game. But combined with your Wii Remote/Nunchuck controller configuration it allows for easy, rapid-fire and realistic action. And with a sawed off design it can be fired either from the shoulder or extended out like a pistol. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Cabela\'s Big Game Hunter 2010</i> is played from a first-person perspective featuring a combination of mission play and mini-games that make up the already mentioned hunting trials. Players are guided through structured mission play by their in-game sponsor who contacts them, points them in the right direction and offers tips and warnings in the field as the hunt makes its way across the globe. In each hunt players are graded on a variety of skills ranging from safe navigation across dangerous wilderness terrain, animal tracking, and their abilities at stalking from cover and making clean, efficient kills. Players track game and find their way around the environment using ""Hunter\'s Sense,"" a type of bullet time in which evidence of animals, varied available cover options to shoot from, specific animal locations and their level of alertness can be seen in a temporarily, slowed down view with on-screen color-coated indicators revealing each. More rapid player movement, including sprint functionality, is available in regular view. Once an animal is sighted in the players weapon scope varying possible point totals are visible on the animal according to where it might be hit with a projectile. These include strikes to the heart, spine, lung and head. During hunts players can quickly and easily change weapons at the push of a button as the trophy animal persuaded requires. In-game weapons range from a variety of rifles, pistols, bows and more which can be unlocked as the game progresses.

These events encompass everything from motocross, supercross, omnicross and others and also feature a high level of trick completion. Vehicles used in the races run the gamut from specific MX bikes, and ATVS, to super buggies and trucks. Gameplay in the dirt-covered environments faced require skill and guts to master. Along with the new Rhythm Racing 2.0 physics engine, <i>MX vs. ATV: Reflex</i> helps players achieve in these areas with a new control scheme, Rider Reflex. <p/> <b>Rider Reflex</b><br/> Build around dual control inputs, the Rider Reflex control scheme built into <i>MX vs. ATV: Reflex</i> is designed to revolutionize the way you race in several different ways. The first of these is by improving precision turning when you need it. Using a combination of the D-pad and buttons players control the direction of the bike, and the direction the rider leans, allowing for the tighter turns and maneuverability found on a real bike. Similarly this ability to use the rider\'s weight, also impacts more subtle abilities to control a bike, both on the ground and in the air, as well as has a major role in allowing players to pull off tricks like never before. There are several tricks possible, all of which will take some time to discover and master, but the basic trick performance mechanism is simple. To pull off a trick just hold down the Y button while in the air button, use the D-pad to select a trick and modify them for extra style using the left and right shoulder buttons. <p/> <b>Wreck Avoidance System</b><br/> No matter how sick attempted tricks might seem, they aren\'t worth much if you can\'t stick the landing. With this in mind <i>MX vs. ATV: Reflex</i> helps to get you back on the ground, safe and sound with a wreck avoidance system. In the event that players can\'t manage to use the Rider Reflex control system to right themselves as they come back to earth, this automatic system provides a last chance to avoid disaster by alerting you to your danger with an onscreen arrow as the ground rises to meet you. Players must quickly use the D-pad to match the direction of the arrow in order for the rider to regain his balance and keep on going. But expect to be challenged. If you are too slow you will wreck, and the harder the impact the less time you have to react. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Rider Reflex</b></li> <ul> <li>Battle for position with new independent rider and vehicle control.</li> <li>Wreck avoidance system lets you wrestle your ride back from the verge of catastrophe &ndash; if you can.</li> </ul> <li><b>Stunts</b></li> <ul> <li>Dual controls let you tear it up with death-defying stunts and high-flying freestyle action.</li> <li>Soar high above the course with freestyle tricks designed for the DS/DSi.</li> </ul> <li><b>Vehicles</b></li> <ul> <li>Race all the fastest and fiercest MX bikes, ATVs, trucks, buggies and more.</li> <li>Crush your opponent with the Nintendo DS exclusive monster truck series.</li> </ul> <li><b>Multiplayer</b></li> <ul> <li>The mayhem never ends as you string together your own series of events.</li> <li>4-player multiplayer wireless DS single-card download play support lets you challenge your friends and brings players of all skill levels together with only one game cartridge.</li> </ul> </ul> <td> <tr> </table>']","by

Both contain colored buttons and pads respectively to guide players as they follow along with the game\'s familiar color-coated <i>Guitar Hero</i> style gameplay. The drum skin rests atop your DS\' D-pad and face buttons in an arrangement designed to mimic an actual drum kit, while the grip plugs into the DS\' Game Boy Advance slot allowing for simultaneous easy use and screen viewing. The game includes multiple play options, including single player, and multiplayer modes and even the ability to team up with a partner playing on a Wii version of the game for an all new level of competition. <p/> <b>The Song List</b><br/> <i>Band Hero</i> for Nintendo DS features over 30 master recordings from some of the hottest bands of today and yesteryear.

return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Similar to earlier games in the <i>MX vs. ATV</i> series, gameplay in <i>Reflex</i> revolves around multiplayer racing (12-player), across a wide variety of off-road race event types. These events encompass everything from motocross, supercross, omnicross and others and also feature a high level of trick completion, judged with several parameters in mind. Vehicles used in the races run the gamut from specific MX bikes, and ATVS, to super buggies and trucks. Gameplay in the dirt-covered environments faced require skill and guts to master. Along with the new Rhythm Racing 2.0 physics engine, <i>MX vs. ATV: Reflex</i> helps players achieve in these areas with a new control scheme, Rider Reflex. <p/> <b>Rider Reflex</b><br/> Build around dual stick controls, the Rider Reflex control scheme built into <i>MX vs. ATV: Reflex</i> is designed to revolutionize the way you race in several different ways. The first of these is by improving precision turning when you need it. With the left stick controlling the bike and the the right the direction that the rider leans, tighter and faster turns are possible by jerking the two stick in the same direction, carving the player to a stop or changing direction in a instant, just as you would on a real bike. Similarly this ability to use the rider\'s weight, also impacts more subtle abilities to control a bike, both on the ground and in the air as the rider uses his weight to slow, or speed up his momentum at crucial times and change the angle of his bike to correct a bad takeoff But Rider Reflex is not just about steering. It also has a major role to play while while you are in the air, allowing players to pull off tricks like never before. There are several tricks and freestyle variations possible, all of which will take some time to discover and master, but the basic trick performance mechanism is simple. To pull off a trick just hold down the left bumper and indicate direction on the right stick. Players can hold the stick in the final position to hold the trick longer. The tougher the move, the more movement is required of the stick. Tricks can also be combined for extra style. <p/> <b>Wreck Avoidance System</b><br/> No matter how sick attempted tricks might seem, they aren\'t worth much if you can\'t stick the landing. With this in mind <i>MX vs. ATV: Reflex</i> helps to get you back on the ground, safe and sound with a wreck avoidance system. In the event that players can\'t manage to use the Rider Reflex control system to right themselves as they come back to earth, this automatic system provides a last chance to avoid the disaster by alerting you to your danger with an onscreen arrow as the ground rises to meet you. Players must quickly flick the right stick in the direct of the arrow for the rider to regain his balance and keep on going. But expect to be challenged. If you are too slow you will wreck, and the harder the impact the less time you have to react. <p/> <b>Terrain</b><br/> Featuring a new terrain engine, <i>MX vs. ATV: Reflex</i> provides unprecedented terrain deformation that create ever-changing courses as off-road vehicles carve lines and deep ruts that have a real-time impact on gameplay and remain persistent through the full length of each race. <p/> <b>Ride With Your Favorite Motocross Stars</b><br/> More than just a game, <i>MX Vs ATV: Reflex</i> allows players to share the track and race against their favorite top athletes in professional motocross and supercross. Just a few of the top riders that players can expect to cross paths with include, James Stewart, Ricky Carmichael, Jeremy McGrath, Josh Grant, Ryan Villopoto and many more. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Rider Reflex</b></li> <ul> <li>Battle for position with new independent rider and vehicle control.</li> <li>Wreck avoidance system lets you wrestle your ride back from the verge of catastrophe &ndash; if you can.</li> </ul> <li><b>Terrain</b></li> <ul> <li>Real-time deformation continuously changes the track beneath you with every lap.

As Seto searches through these eerily calm and beautiful ruins of a civilization lost, he comes across a mysterious girl named Ren, who quickly scurries away from him despite possibly being the only other living human in the world. As he struggles to be reunited with Ren and search for other survivors, he must fight off the ghosts and demons that haunt this forsaken land while also piecing together the mystery of what brought about the disappearance of all mankind. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Although <i>Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon</i> contains light RPG gameplay elements, its gameplay is based primarily in single player exploration and action. Players assume the role of Seto, who is almost entirely alone in a fog-shrouded post-apocalyptic world, but who is determined to find any and all other people who may also still live, especially the girl Ren. To do this players use the Wii Remote/Nunchuk controller configuration. The Nunchuk controls Seto, while the Wii Remote acts as a flashlight, illuminating the dark corners of the gameworld. As the game proceeds this light will also reveal other items which Seto will need to move through the game and survive the ghosts and other creatures he encounters. These include items such as weapons to protect himself and a microphone and metal detector to search the gameworld and better understand it. <p/> Along with these utilitarian items the player will also come across a variety of other objects, such as letters, which will reveal bits of the lives of the people who used to inhabit the gameworld, and possibly add clues to what caused the state the world is now in. The RPG light elements players can expect are an inventory system that must be managed, a leveling system allowing for better weapons, simple and more elaborate attacks using the Wii Remote\'s ""A"" button, purchasable upgrades and a few optional side quests. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Emotional Story of Abandonment, Loneliness, and Redemption</b> &ndash; The game&rsquo;s focus is on human drama as a boy wanders a post-apocalyptic world in search of answers and companionship.</li> <li><b>Gorgeous Graphics and Lighting Effects</b> &ndash; High production values bring the desolate but eerily beautiful world to life as lighting reflects realistically off environments to show all the minor details of a previously inhabited land.</li> <li><b>Moving Musical Score</b> &ndash; A haunting and inspired soundtrack helps convey a full range of emotions, ranging from utter despair of isolation, to the joy of finding small victories where least expected.</li> <li><b>Controls Optimized for the Wii Remote</b> &ndash; The Wii Remote is used as a flashlight and also as a proximity sensor to track invisible ghosts, while Seto\'s movements are controlled using the attached nunchuk\'s analog stick.</li> <li><b>A Mix of Exploration-Adventure and RPG Gameplay</b> &ndash; Players enjoy a mix of exploration and adventure gameplay, with light RPG elements added into the mix.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Additional Screenshots</b>:<br/> <table cellspacing=""0"" align=""center""> <tr> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002E6XY6U.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=659,height=469\');

Chuck\'s motivation for taking part and risking life and limb is his daughter Katey, who since being bitten by a zombie requires a daily dose of Zombrex to prevent her from turning into one of the living dead. There\'s no denying that Zombrex works, but since it\'s the only drug on the market, its price is high. <p/> During his time in Fortune City a zombie outbreak occurs and Chuck must survive the onslaught of the undead for 72 hours. Pitted against two fearsome threats - tens of thousands of zombies and the constant countdown of the clock - while potentially rescuing other survivors of the zombie apocalypse, players must also unravel the greater conspiracy behind the outbreak and as importantly find the Zombrex necessary to stop Katey from joining the ever growing zombie horde. Players will shoot, stab, carve and drive their way through enemies in order to beat the clock and survive 72-hours in the darkly comedic, no holds-barred confines of Fortune City. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Dead Rising 2</i> delivers more of the signature gameplay that the series is known for plus a number of new features.

But now, in <i>Dead Rising 2</i> with thousands of zombies filling every square inch of Fortune City, Chuck is going to need to be even more resourceful and inventive by creating combination weapons to save the day. Players will be able to take two objects, a roll of tape and with a little inventiveness create an advanced zombie-killing combo weapon - a piece of wood and a lawnmower become Portamower, the handheld mower that cuts zombies down to size in an instant; while a garden rake and car battery combine to create an electrified zombie prod. The more combo weapons a player uses, the more Prestige Points (PPS) they will gain along the way in order to level up Chuck. <p/> <b>Development Team</b><br/> <i>Dead Rising 2</i> is developed by Canadian developer Blue Castle Games in close collaboration with Capcom. A number of members from the original <i>Dead Rising</i> team have added their talents and experience to the Blue Castle Games team throughout the development process, including Capcom\'s global head of research and development, Keiji Inafune, who as the game\'s producer, and played an active role in the project. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Thousands of Zombies On Screen</b> - The undead are everywhere creating a dynamic and challenging zombie-killing experience for the player as weapons will be created to kill massive amounts of zombies at one time</li> <li><b>New Storyline and Characters</b> - A new protagonist, Chuck Greene, is just the beginning in a long list of new characters, new survivors and new more vicious psychos that will be introduced to fans in the new world of <i>Dead Rising</i></li> <li><b>2-Player Co-Op</b> - Co-op play is introduced to the <i>Dead Rising</i> universe for the first time as players can invite their friends to partner up with them at any time to take on the zombie massacre- tag-team style.

The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode, an optional prologue to the game available as downloadable content and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once. <p/> <table align=left width=210> <tr> <td valign=""top"" height=""45""><img alt=""Dead Rising 2 game logo"" title=""Dead Rising 2 game logo"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dead.rising.2.logo.200.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""200"" height=""61""></td> </tr> </table> <table width=""250"" cellpadding=""10"" align=""right""> <tr> <td align=""center"" height=""167"" valign=""top""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dead.rising.2.01.lg.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Hero, Chuck Greene knocking out zombies in Dead Rising 2"" title=""Hero, Chuck Greene knocking out zombies in Dead Rising 2"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dead.rising.2.01.sm.jpg"" border=""0"" width=""250"" height=""141""></a><br/> <div class=""imageCaption"">Same comic zombie-killing action.<a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dead.rising.2.01.lg.jpg"" target=""_blank""><br/>View larger</a>.</div> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align=""center"" height=""134"" valign=""top""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dead.rising.2.03.lg.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""4-player gladiator type multiplayer game in Dead Rising 2"" title=""4-player gladiator type multiplayer game in Dead Rising 2"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dead.rising.2.03.sm.jpg"" border=""0"" width=""250"" height=""141""></a><br/> <div class=""imageCaption"">All-new backstory and characters.<a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dead.rising.2.03.lg.jpg"" target=""_blank""><br/>View larger</a>.</div> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align=""center"" height=""31"" valign=""top""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dead.rising.2.02.lg.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Player-created explosive arrows available in Dead Rising 2"" title=""Player-created explosive arrows available in Dead Rising 2"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dead.rising.2.02.sm.jpg"" border=""0"" width=""250"" height=""141""></a><br/> <div class=""imageCaption"">Inventive weapons creation system.<a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dead.rising.2.02.lg.jpg"" target=""_blank""><br/>View larger</a>.</div> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align=""center"" height=""31"" valign=""top""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dead.rising.2.04.lg.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""In-game wristwatch messaging and reminders in Dead Rising 2"" title=""In-game wristwatch messaging and reminders in Dead Rising 2"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dead.rising.2.04.sm.jpg"" border=""0"" width=""250"" height=""141""></a><br/> <div class=""imageCaption"">In-game messaging/reminders, 2-player coop, a DLC prologue and more.<a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dead.rising.2.04.lg.jpg"" target=""_blank""><br/>View larger</a>.</div> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Story</b><br/> The sequel to the million-plus selling <i>Dead Rising</i>, <i>Dead Rising 2</i> sees the player take on the role of former Motocross champion Chuck Greene, who has come to Fortune City, America\'s newest gambling paradise, to compete in ""Terror is Reality,"" a gruesome game show that dares contestants to survive zombie-filled environments for big money prizes at the delight of TV audiences around the globe. Chuck\'s motivation for taking part and risking life and limb is his daughter Katey, who since being bitten by a zombie requires a daily dose of Zombrex to prevent her from turning into one of the living dead. There\'s no denying that Zombrex works, but since it\'s the only drug on the market, its price is high. <p/> During his time in Fortune City a zombie outbreak occurs and Chuck must survive the onslaught of the undead for 72 hours. Pitted against two fearsome threats - tens of thousands of zombies and the constant countdown of the clock - while potentially rescuing other survivors of the zombie apocalypse, players must also unravel the greater conspiracy behind the outbreak and as importantly find the Zombrex necessary to stop Katey from joining the ever growing zombie horde. Players will shoot, stab, carve and drive their way through enemies in order to beat the clock and survive 72-hours in the darkly comedic, no holds-barred confines of Fortune City. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Dead Rising 2</i> delivers more of the signature gameplay that the series is known for plus a number of new features. Players who might need some help or simply want to share the zombie bashing fun with a friend will now be able to play in online 2-player co-op. Simply use the in-game transceiver to call for assistance at any time and once your partner has accepted, they will arrive by your side for double the action. <p/> With hundreds of zombies on screen at any one time, the original <i>Dead Rising</i> forced gamers to take everyday objects they found in the mall and use them as weapons. But now, in <i>Dead Rising 2</i> with thousands of zombies filling every square inch of Fortune City, Chuck is going to need to be even more resourceful and inventive by creating combination weapons to save the day. Players will be able to take two objects, a roll of tape and with a little inventiveness create an advanced zombie-killing combo weapon - a piece of wood and a lawnmower become Portamower, the handheld mower that cuts zombies down to size in an instant; while a garden rake and car battery combine to create an electrified zombie prod. The more combo weapons a player uses, the more Prestige Points (PPs) they will gain along the way in order to level up Chuck. <p/> <b>Optional Downloadable Prologue</b><br/> Ahead of the full game, Capcom will release original downloadable content Xbox Live with <i>Dead Rising 2: CASE ZERO</i>. This prologue consists of unique content not available in the full retail release of <i>Dead Rising 2</i> and will introduce new protagonist Chuck Greene as he and his daughter find themselves caught in the desert town of Still Creek that has been overrun with zombies. Set two years after the Willamette incident and three before the action of <i>Dead Rising 2</i>, <i>Dead Rising 2: CASE ZERO</i> will help bridge the gap between the two titles and give players a taste of the new gameplay they will experience in <i>Dead Rising 2</i> as they create combo weapons, rescue survivors and take on a ruthless psychos before making their escape. <p/> <b>Development Team</b><br/> <i>Dead Rising 2</i> is developed by Canadian developer Blue Castle Games in close collaboration with Capcom. A number of members from the original <i>Dead Rising</i> team have added their talents and experience to the Blue Castle Games team throughout the development process, including Capcom\'s global head of research and development, Keiji Inafune, who as the game\'s producer, and played an active role in the project. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Thousands of Zombies On Screen</b> - The undead are everywhere creating a dynamic and challenging zombie-killing experience for the player as weapons will be created to kill massive amounts of zombies at one time</li> <li><b>New Storyline and Characters</b> - A new protagonist, Chuck Greene, is just the beginning in a long list of new characters, new survivors and new more vicious psychos that will be introduced to fans in the new world of <i>Dead Rising</i></li> <li><b>2-Player Co-Op</b> - Co-op play is introduced to the <i>Dead Rising</i> universe for the first time as players can invite their friends to partner up with them at any time to take on the zombie massacre- tag-team style. Play with a friend and have even more fun as you lure zombies in using strategic items like a toy helicopter or a firecracker. Once the zombies have gathered, your friend can rain bullets from above or shoot at a strategically-placed gas tank to create a deadly explosion that will take out masses of the enemy. Killing zombies with a friend is always more fun</li> <li><b>Terror is Reality</b> - Allows 4 players to compete in a gladiator type show that pits zombies against a group of players in the ultimate Vs. multiplayer blood bath</li> <li><b>Combo Weapons</b> - Players can combine two everyday items using duct tape to create the ultimate zombie killing creations such as the Portamower and Paddlesaw. Unlocking combo cards along the way will give players the advantage as the helpful cards will show you what items are best for combining. The more zombies you destroy using your creative combo\'s, the more Prestige Points you can earn which levels up Chuck along the way</li> <li><b>Prologue</b> - Compelling new content that will be released ahead of the game launch, <i>Dead Rising 2: CASE ZERO</i> will give fans a taste of the experience while introducing you to the new characters and story that will unfold in <i>Dead Rising 2</i></li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

During certain lunar eclipses the walls of Sheogh weaken and demons burst forth, plunging Ashan into war. And since the dawn of times, the demon legions have been repelled by the allies thanks to a powerful artifact known as the Blade of Binding. Once again the armies of Sheogh are coming and the Blade will be wielded... Your journey in the world of Might and Magic will be punctuated with riddles, extraordinary encounters and epic battles against creatures searching for some fresh hero blood. Your hero will travel thanks to a node system, so watch your step as some of these nodes might trigger special actions, hide terrifying traps or even legendary treasures such as forgotten artifacts or secret units. To stand a chance against your enemies, your hero will have to equip magical artifacts and build up the most powerful army. Your army will be composed of Core, Elite and Champion units, each of them having specific sizes, strengths and abilities. Its up to you to choose wisely each of these units combined to the appropriate artifact and work out the best strategy to wipe out your enemies. While roaming around Ashan or winning battles, you will discover new artifacts and gather different types of resources such as Ore, Gold and Blood Crystals. These earnings can be used to buy new Elite or Champion units for your army through specific Creature Dwelling buildings. Make sure to look everywhere as you will be able to unlock and collect powerful hidden units and artifacts! You will be confronted with many challenges such as defeating the enemy heroes by crossing their armies in standard battles or launching into special challenges and Boss fights where your strategic skills will be put to a severe test.

Gameplay consists of a variety of beauty challenges which test the player\'s ability to do everything from recreating specific looks on in-game characters from memory and using a model, to developing more subtle skills like applying makeup and hair techniques to create specific overall effects. Alternately players also let their creativity run wild in Free Mode, where they practice what they have learned on a variety of representations of women with different physical attributes. Success at these challenges earns players points, which in turn can be used for in-game shopping sprees for items like nail polish, eyeliner, powder compacts, lipstick, makeup brushes, mascara and more. Also, the game\'s wireless functionality allows players to share their created looks with friends via wireless DS multi-card play. Although playable on the DS, <i>Style Lab</i> games are optimized to take advantage of the DSi\'s advanced functionality. An example of this in <i>Style Lab: Makeover</i> is the ability to import pictures of players and friends taken with the DSi\'s digital cameras into the game. These images can then be used as backgrounds for endless makeovers where everything can be altered with the tap of a stylus. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Become part of the game by taking your picture with the Nintendo DSi and using it to create your own face in the game and then find the perfect styles to suit your facial features.</li> <li>Transform yourself by taking on beauty challenges to improve your skills, which will earn you points and rewards, and by learning tips and tricks that you can use in real life.</li> <li>Discover your own unique style with personality tests and in-game expert recommendations.</li> <li>Unleash your creativity in Free Mode, where your imagination has no limits.</li> <li>Share your new looks with friends via local wireless.</li> <li>Take pictures of your friends and give them makeovers with your new expertise.</li> <li>Use your mini-game points to go shopping for new beauty products and send them to friends.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Screenshots</b>:<br/> <table cellspacing=""0"" align=""center""> <tr> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002EWD06I.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=286,height=420\'); return false;""><img alt=""Makeup application in Style Lab: Makeover"" title=""Makeup application in Style Lab: Makeover"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002EWD06I.02.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Learn makeup application.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002EWD06I.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=286,height=420\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002EWD06I.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=286,height=420\'); return false;""><img alt=""Hair coloring technique in Style Lab: Makeover"" title=""Hair coloring technique in Style Lab: Makeover"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002EWD06I.03.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Hair coloring.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002EWD06I.03.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=286,height=420\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002EWD06I.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=286,height=420\'); return false;""><img alt=""Hair styling technique in Style Lab: Makeover"" title=""Hair styling technique in Style Lab: Makeover"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002EWD06I.04.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br/> <center> <span class=""caption"">Hair styling.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002EWD06I.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=286,height=420\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002EWD06I.05.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;""><img alt=""DSi camera functionality Style Lab: Makeover"" title=""DSi camera functionality Style Lab: Makeover"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002EWD06I.05.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">DSi camera functionality.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002EWD06I.05.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by
