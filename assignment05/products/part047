Take to the seas and command a huge variety of ships in an equally as varied choice of theaters and historical conflicts. Naval officers and naval strategy fans alike will revel in the depth and richness of Larry Bond's Harpoon  Commanders Edition. Experience realistic gameplay with all new features, art, and more! Choose from an accurate and editable database of platforms, weapons, and sensors, players can fight one of 269 provided scenarios covering the height of the Cold War to Pirates in Malaysia, or use the provided editors to create their own.\n\nLarry Bond's Harpoon - Commanders Edition is the newest in a series of computer adaptations of the award-winning Harpoon wargame system that served as a reference to Tom Clancys The Hunt for Red October, Clancy/Bonds Red Storm Rising, and Bonds Red Phoenix. Harpoon has shocked naval professionals, entertained the public, and educated everyone, since 1989. Harpoon is so accurate an earlier edition was the first (and only) software ever sold by the US Naval Institute.

Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Experience golf as it really is, from the crisp feel of your first drive to the ball's final roll into the 18th cup. The 1999 Edition of Microsoft Golf has an authentic feel with natural, easy-to-use controls, seven challenging courses, and a wide range of choices for play."", ""Tee up on the famed Donald Ross Memorial course--a compilation of the best holes created by Donald Ross--or grab your clubs and head for any of the other six championship courses, including Greg Norman's famed Medallist course in Hobe Sound, Florida. Gorgeous graphics and naturally fluid game play make all 117 holes a realistic, relaxing experience."", ""Now that the Microsoft Golf series is no longer being developed by Access, it's really beginning to shine. Because Access' contract mandated that the version developed for Microsoft be inferior to the most recent version of Links, previous incarnations of Microsoft Golf were essentially Links Lite for Windows. Since Microsoft switched over to Friendly Software and the engine used for the Greg Norman games for the Golf 98 edition, the series has steadily improved to the point that it has become a real contender in the world of golf games."", ""Golf 99's improvements are minor, following the current trend among sports games of publishing a new edition every year and only revamping the whole system every couple years. Graphically, not much seems all that different from Golf 98, beyond the golfers themselves. Courses are detailed and finely rendered, though still shy of the quality and detail in Links and Jack Nicklaus. Golfer animations appear smoother, more realistic, and more fluid than ever. The animations are still not synchronized with the mouse control. But in most golf games nowadays, few animations are."", 'The bigger change is the addition of three excellent new courses: Donald Ross Memorial, Eagle Heights, and Medalist Golf Club. These join Teeth of the Dog, the Links at Casa de Campo, Bay Harbor, and the Preserve 9, for a total of seven courses, which is more than most of the competition is offering. The courses provide a good range of challenges and are offered in sharp detail. Unfortunately, the system is no longer compatible with courses produced for Links, as it used to be, thus limiting new course selection to any future Microsoft add-on discs.', 'Control is the same as in Golf 98, with four options to choose from: three-click, two-click, mouse-swing, and ""sim"" modes. The mouse swing is adequately executed, with a wedge-shaped powerbar displaying input strength. It\'s a little hard to interpret, but it works pretty smoothly and responds to practice. The final mode is a simulation-play option that is unique to Microsoft Golf. Lifted from Greg Norman, it enables you to allot points to different swing characteristics to build a golfer profile. You execute a swing with a single click, which allows you to concentrate on course management over timed clicks. It\'s not an option most people would choose, but it does radically shift the focus of the game and allows you to experiment with different approaches to a course.', 'The big changes from the previous edition are supposed to be in multiplayer support and physics. While the former is greatly improved, the latter appears only marginally different. Multiplayer support for single and tournament games is very strong, with competition available via IPX, TCP/IP, direct connect, or the Microsoft Internet Gaming Zone. The Zone, one of the best multiplayer forums out there, provides quick and easy matchmaking and smooth connections.', ""Ball dynamics don't fare quite as well. Try as I might I couldn't see much improvement in them. Over-striking the ball still yields too little a penalty. You can essentially let it go all the way into the red on the upswing, and most of the time you won't notice any real penalty. Chipping is also supposed to be better, but I found chips from the rough and sand a little too easy, a little too often. That's too bad, since the game has an easy and powerful interface that allows you to set spin and trajectory with a simple click for a more nuanced approach to swings. Microsoft needs to work a little on its balls to bring the system up to par."", ""The rest of the game is strong, however. There are plenty of options for customizing players, right down to ball type and swing strength. The shot-specific commentary by CBS's David Feherty is good, but his color commentary is hollow and annoying. With the PGA/Tiger Woods series from EA slipping far behind, Microsoft is now clearly the third choice after Links and Nicklaus. Though Golf 99 doesn't feel like a big upgrade from the '98 edition, Microsoft's offer of a $30 rebate to owners of last year's version brings the price right in line. Without the rebate, it would be hard to recommend this one to people who own the '98 edition. For people who didn't buy Golf 98 because they associate the series with earlier, weaker entries, it's well worth a fresh look. <i>--T. Liam McDonald</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

A grown-up Indy (Harrison Ford) reveals himself shortly afterward in a familiar classroom scene, teaching archeology to a disproportionate number of starry-eyed female college students in 1938. Once again, however, Mr. Jones is drawn away from his day job after an art collector (Julian Glover) approaches him with a proposition to find the much sought after Holy Grail. Circumstances reveal that there was another avid archeologist in search of the famed cup  Indiana Jones' father, Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery)  who had recently disappeared during his efforts. The junior and senior members of the Jones family find themselves in a series of tough situations in locales ranging from Venice to the most treacherous spots in the Middle East. Complicating the situation further is the presence of Elsa (Alison Doody), a beautiful and intelligent woman with one fatal flaw: she's an undercover Nazi agent. The search for the grail is a dangerous quest, and its discovery may prove fatal to those who seek it for personal gain.

Players will be able to expand their city using bridges, forts, walls, and towers, and the new ""settlers"" resource allows for multiple paths to settlement growth. Gamers looking to flex their military muscles now have the ability to control armies in battle, fight with new units like mounted knights, build siege machines, and clash with a second type of barbarian. Economic and diplomatic factors have also been enhanced thanks to new trade mechanics, the effects of crime on city growth, and the introduction of an in-game currency. Those looking to re-create the past can try Imperium Romanum\'s History Mode, which presents players with a timeline and missions based on historical events. Actual buildings from the era are also available, so players can visit Circus Maximus, as well as real theatres, stables, and schools. Gamers looking to build Rome in a day can also try out the interactive mission mode, which allows players to activate goals whenever they wish.

Rosco McQueen Firefighter Extreme,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Only you can save the day in this unique 3D platformer that puts your fire fighting skills to the test. Using only an axe a fire-hose and a computer companion can you extinguish the flames before things get explosive and innocent people are killed.', 'Rosco McQueen: Firefighter Extreme is part of a new wave of kinder, gentler games (more than one of which is about fighting fires) in which life is to be saved and not destroyed. It\'s also a decent but fairly predictable 3D adventure game/shooter, where the shooting is done with a fire hose instead of a rocket launcher. <P>With ax and portable water system in hand, and a weird hovering robo-buddy tagging along, you enter the not-yet-burning building. Inside you\'ll find hapless humans to rescue and pesky pink robots to extinguish. Keeping with the game\'s soft focus, none of your foes are living (so there\'s no ""killing""), and cuteness abounds. Power-ups include milk and Evian-shaped bottles of water to replenish your supply. There\'re also bouncy laundry baskets and ironing boards to superjump on. It\'s all very child-safe. If I\'m not mistaken, I actually heard the voice-over of Rosco exclaim a la Ned Flanders, ""Ah, God\'s precious water.""  <P>Most times, when you first enter a room, nothing is on fire. Don\'t crack that Welch\'s Grape yet though; your robot foes have an endless supply of bombs to drop that set the place ablaze. (Actually, fires are usually contained to the minimalist-sculpture-looking piles of boxes that litter each level, but if they burn long enough, you lose, so....) As long as they\'re ""alive"" you can extinguish as many small fires as you want; they\'ll make more. It doesn\'t take long to notice the game-winning pattern: enter room, kill robots, extinguish fires, then save folks and trip security switches, and so on. This is the game\'s biggest flaw. After about a half hour, you\'ve got it down. Sure, new design elements, power-ups, and so forth are introduced as you push on, but the fundamental play patterns are predictable and static. <P>Control is of the standard over-the-shoulder rotate/strafe/move-forward variety. Your trusty ax is used both to break down doors and crush evil robots, and power-ups are available that allow you to, well, break down heavier doors. There\'s also a jump button and a hose button. In general, control is fairly tight, but, as with most 3D adventure games, rotation feels a little different from the last one you played and requires some getting used to. Hit detection is decent, although I\'m still not convinced I missed as many chops as it says I did. <P>Rosco is a good enough looking game. What\'s not to like about robots that look like extras from Disney\'s The Black Hole? The flames are pretty, but nothing compared with the complex fire patterns of DreamWorks Interactive\'s Skullmonkeys, nor do they act as light sources. Soundwise, the continual vocal prompting is repetitive but useful (for example, ""Water\'s low,"" and ""Ooh, I detected a hotspot, Rosco; check the map""), but much of the soundtrack is irritating, especially the overabundance of Asian musical motifs in the laundry room levels of the game. That\'s just plain dumb. <P>In all, Rosco McQueen Firefighter Extreme is a good game for parents looking for less violent fare for their kids. A lot of the game\'s shortcomings, like its repetitive gameplay patterns, might not trouble the young ones nearly as much as the rest of us, for whom this one warrants a rental at best. --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Leisure Suit Larry's Casino - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<i>Leisure Suit Larry</i> does it again--this time in Las Vegas style. His casino includes all of your favorite table games plus some unique multiplayer ones that are played over the Internet. When you've lost all your money at the table, try out some of the game's other online features, which include joke-telling contests, competitions to write the best pickup lines, and <i>Say What?!</i>, a new game where players compete to write the funniest definition."", ""At first glance, the combination of the Leisure Suit Larry franchise and a casino game sounds like a match made in sleaze heaven. Those who want to be richer and smoother than Rico Suave will definitely find the style of play satisfying. But the truth of the matter is that the actual gameplay offered in Larry's Casino is a far cry from a solid casino experience."", ""Leisure Suit Larry's Casino is more of a virtual casino simulation than a gambling game. It allows you to assume the guise of a high roller at a casino owned by the sleaze-king himself, Larry. The single-player game allows you to play five standard casino games, and the Internet multiplayer style gives even more varieties of play through interaction with other players in a comedy club and party games. Within the context of the casino atmosphere, you win money and spend it at the gift shop, restaurant, or bar. Furthermore, these places offer the chance to schmooze with other players before heading back to the gambling tables."", ""The problems with this game all stem from its lack of focus. Each individual casino game (poker, craps, roulette, slots, blackjack) lacks the depth of options and gameplay that some of the more detailed gambling games have. Poker, for example, only offers five single-player versions (one more is available online) and very limited play options. The computer opponents you play against are randomly selected and are not configurable as to playing style. The only game with a decent set of play options is blackjack. The other games just present standard casino fare and don't go far to help you develop any casino skills. Even the slot machines are pretty much standard, and their winning options don't change from one machine to the next, only a graphics change lets you know you're at a different machine."", ""Now as bad as the casino play is, the online party games do offer some fun. The premise here is that if you lose all your cash, you can get some back by playing games that test your charisma instead. The three games available are Pick-Up Master, the Funny Comedy Club, and Say What?!. Probably the most entertaining is Say What?!, a game in which players make up definitions for words submitted by others. The catch here is that these games are online only, so your enjoyment of these is only as good as the people you're playing against."", ""What's the bottom line? If you're looking for a good casino game, this definitely isn't it. There are other games that allow the science of beating the odds to come to the fore. If you're looking for an interesting party game to chat it up with some people online and meet people unashamed to have their character icons appear as swingers who look like they're constantly sitting in a hot tub, then Larry's Casino is worth a look. <i>--Tahsin Shamma</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling 2,,['Features Multiplayer Mode'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation']",{},"['Whether you are a hard core or casual bowler, <i>Brunswick  Circuit Pro Bowling 2</i> has something for everyone. Features include  enhanced graphics, accurate reproductions of the latest bowling  equipment, an improved interface, multiplayer support for up to eight  players, and a completely overhauled create-a-bowler mode.  Additionally, there are new modes of play (including team and skills  challenge), real ProStaff tutorials, enhanced bowler and crowd  reactions, auto-replay functionality, and dual-shock and analog  support. Strike!', ""It's difficult to think of bowling as a sport. Whereas most sports demand you be in excellent physical condition, bowling usually consists of older, heavier players who spend at least half of the game sitting down. But that's neither here nor there. The biggest selling point of Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling 2 for the PlayStation is just how many options are packed into the game. The game sports nine play modes, each with its own feel and style. You can opt for a basic game, tournament play, teamplay, a skins game, and a skins challenge, as well as start a career, practice, or play a game of the uber-groovy cosmic bowling - which is bowling in the dark with lots of neon and black lights that make everything look crazy. To do the actual rolling you can either select from one of the 11 Brunswick pro bowlers in the game, or you can create your own bowler. The create-a-bowler mode is a simplified version of the create-a-wrestler mode found in THQ's wrestling games. You can choose from several different body styles, customize your bowler's features, and then set attribute points (it should be noted that our attempts at re-creating the cast of The Big Lebowski failed). Before you start rolling, you can select an actual Brunswick ball for your bowler to use for his strike and spare throws that conforms to his personal bowling style. All these options make Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling 2 almost infinitely customizable, and they greatly enhance the replay value. Once out on the lane, you'll spend your time in one of two different control screens. The first shows your bowler's stance and lets you line up your feet and your shot, as well as tweak your spin and even control your power. Once you've lined up your shot, you switch to the actual throw, where you use a meter to control actual power and accuracy. For non-analog controllers, this means using a power meter and hitting a button to stop the moving line in two correct spots along the meter. But for analog controllers, a clever pull-and-push method has been implemented that seems much more realistic. Pull the analog stick back to start your power meter, and push it forward at the right time to stop it and judge accuracy. If the analog stick hits exactly forward, your shot will be right on, while a slight deviation to the left or right will cause the ball to travel in that direction. While this isn't the first time a meter like this has been used in a sports game, it's definitely a great addition.  The graphics however are a real letdown. Most of the bowlers look pretty blocky, and the throwing animations look extremely unrealistic. The lane backgrounds are nice, but the crowd looks extremely out of place, almost laughably so. Once you roll, the camera randomly switches around, showing your shot from all sorts of dramatic angles before finally settling on a top-down view of the pins as the ball plows through them. This is a neat feature, and it helps break up the monotony of bowling with a little dramatic flair. Throw a particularly excellent shot and you may get treated with a replay or an animation of your bowler celebrating. While some of the celebrations are pretty funny, some of them take a good while to load and simply aren't worth the wait. Surprisingly, the audio is pretty good. You can choose from two types of music - cosmic jams or Brunswick groove - or surfer rock and hip-hopish house, respectively. The original music is pretty spiffy, especially in the cosmic-bowling mode, where it's notably louder than in other modes. The sound effects are pretty generic - a ball-rolling noise during your roll and a crashing sound when the ball smacks into the pins. If you're playing on TV or in a tournament, the crowd will cheer when you throw rocks and show concern when you split pins. This helps you get into the game and ups the drama on a critical shot. Unfortunately, the hilarious smack-talking-bowler intro movies found in the first game have been left out of this one. But, given the amount of extras packed into Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling 2, you can easily see why the space-sucking movies had to be taken out. But even without Parker Bohn III talking about how he wipes the lane with the competition, this game is a solid bowling title. With plenty of modes and extras, Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling 2 is accurate enough to keep die-hard rollers happy, yet simple enough to be a game even a casual bowling fan would enjoy.  <I>--Ben Stahl </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

As you awake from a coma for the first time since that fateful day, you find the Stilwater you once ruled is in disarray. Unfamiliar gangs have laid claim to your territory, rival factions have taken over your rackets, and cash-hungry corporations have laid waste to your once proud 3rd Street home. Abandoned and left scarred with an unrecognizable face, you seek out a plastic surgeon to begin your new life on the streets. Yet some things never change in Stilwater. <p/>Respect can only be earned and that requires a lifestyle that reflects your unique personality. Your crib, your crew, and your character define who you are on the streets and how you are perceived. The image you portray is as important as the decisions you make in a city ruled by false bravado and impulsive behavior. The only constant is the need for an identity that reflects your individuality. But style and image can only take you so far in a world where actions speak louder than words. Sometimes sending a message to your enemies requires heavy lifting, like that of a rival gang member into oncoming traffic. Respect in Stilwater needs to be taken, and what better way than to grab it from the hands of a gang full of enemies by means of a satchel charge, a flame-thrower or those minigun rounds you\'ve been saving for a special occasion. <p/> <b>Meet Your Homies</b><br/> But remember that the fight to reclaim Stilwater does not have to be waged alone. The Saints once ruled these streets as a crew of brothers, and their return to the top can help be secured through co-operative alliances. The time has finally come to seek revenge against your rivals to reestablish your crew as the rightful kings of Stilwater, but the streets are crawling with bangers. Check out the crews you\'ll run into and remember their faces and their ways:<p/> <TABLE border=""0"" cellpadding=""5""> <TD width=""79""><img valign=""top"" alt=""The Third St. Saints - a gang of \'Saints Row 2\'"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sr2.saints.jpg"" width=""75"" height=""75"" align=""top"" hspace=""0"" vspace=""0""> </TD> <TD width=""850"" valign=""top""><b>3rd Street Saints</b><br/> Once the kings of the city, the Saints have been forced out of their titular home of Saints Row by the Ultor Corporation, a giant conglomerate that gentrified the once poor neighborhood.

As you awake from a coma for the first time since that fateful day, you find the Stilwater you once ruled is in disarray. Unfamiliar gangs have laid claim to your territory, rival factions have taken over your rackets, and cash-hungry corporations have laid waste to your once proud 3rd Street home. Abandoned and left scarred with an unrecognizable face, you seek out a plastic surgeon to begin your new life on the streets. Yet some things never change in Stilwater. <p/>Respect can only be earned and that requires a lifestyle that reflects your unique personality. Your crib, your crew, and your character define who you are on the streets and how you are perceived. The image you portray is as important as the decisions you make in a city ruled by false bravado and impulsive behavior. The only constant is the need for an identity that reflects your individuality. But style and image can only take you so far in a world where actions speak louder than words. Sometimes sending a message to your enemies requires heavy lifting, like that of a rival gang member into oncoming traffic. Respect in Stilwater needs to be taken, and what better way than to grab it from the hands of a gang full of enemies by means of a satchel charge, a flame-thrower or those minigun rounds you\'ve been saving for a special occasion. <p/> <b>Meet Your Homies</b><br/> But remember that the fight to reclaim Stilwater does not have to be waged alone. The Saints once ruled these streets as a crew of brothers, and their return to the top can help be secured through co-operative alliances. The time has finally come to seek revenge against your rivals to reestablish your crew as the rightful kings of Stilwater, but the streets are crawling with bangers. Check out the crews you\'ll run into and remember their faces and their ways:<p/> <TABLE border=""0"" cellpadding=""5""> <TD width=""79""><img valign=""top"" alt=""The Third St. Saints - a gang of \'Saints Row 2\'"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sr2.saints.jpg"" width=""75"" height=""75"" align=""top"" hspace=""0"" vspace=""0""> </TD> <TD width=""850"" valign=""top""><b>3rd Street Saints</b><br/> Once the kings of the city, the Saints have been forced out of their titular home of Saints Row by the Ultor Corporation, a giant conglomerate that gentrified the once poor neighborhood.

Here the DS\' puzzle space now heeds story-based conditions such as varying degrees of gravity according to a player\'s location in the game universe. This combined with a rich and detailed storyline and other fresh gameplay elements make the world of <i>Puzzle Quest: Galactrix</i> a captivating new adventure to explore and conquer. <p/> <b>The Story</b><br/> In <i>Puzzle Quest: Galactrix</i>, mankind has spread across the galaxy into hundreds of solar systems with the aid of an inter-dimensional travel technology known as a leapgate. In this distant future four powerful mega corporations have recently managed to establish control over all technology as well as all forms of government. True to the corruptible nature of absolute power, the result is infighting between the corporations that leads to a horrifying experiment gone wrong which provokes an alien race to attempt the extermination of humankind in response. Players assume the role of a rookie pilot tossed into this expansive and dangerous world as they seek to improve their skills, build up the power of their vessel, negotiate with alien races they come across as they traverse the vast reaches of space and in the end, defuse the pending threat to humanity. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Like <i>Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords</i> before it, gameplay in <i>Puzzle Quest: Galactrix</i> features a unique and addictive combination of story-driven mission play and match-3 puzzle solving. Players begin by creating a character, which can be either male or female, then proceed to make their way across the galaxy building up experience by taking on missions for the four mega corporations controlling Earth. These missions bring players either directly or indirectly into conflict with the different space-based factions and characters that populate the game. The result of these conflicts are head-to-head, match-3 puzzle battles between the player and opponents within the puzzle space on the lower screen of the DS. The goal in these battles are to match like-colored gems in groups of three or more, primarily using the DS stylus to make your moves, all the while with attention given to the fact that the different pieces on the board represent different elements needed to level up your character and space ship and do damage to your opponent\'s ship during your turn. A battle is won when one side\'s shields and health both reach zero, at which point the winning player can distribute points to themselves in various aspects of gunnery, engineering, science, and piloting. Leveling up is important because the amount of each element available to a player\'s ship during battles depends on your current level. Another consideration for players is that these battles are turn-based, meaning that although they are fast moving, they also entail a good deal of strategy as players try and beat opponents not only to key pieces that they need for victory in the battle, but also to level up their character. Within this turn-based format players can also choose to forego matching up standard gem pieces and attack opponent\'s health and shields directly with a weapon or by matching special \'mine pieces\' that do similar damage to opponents during battle. <p/> A final gameplay aspect players will encounter are portals called leapgates. Leapgates allow players to cross vast distances in space and become relevant as players finish off available missions in the area of space that they are in. The challenge of these are that they are locked and to open them players access the puzzle space where leapgates are \'hacked\' by gathering a set amount of specific gem formations within a specified time period.<p/> <b>Brand New Puzzle Board</b><br/> In <i>Puzzle Quest: Galactrix</i> the familiar head-to-head, turn based, match-3 puzzle system familiar to players from earlier games now includes hexagonal shaped board pieces and a round puzzle space, making for a new level of strategy. Through this system battles can occur in both space and on planets, each with different gravity mechanics. On planets, gems replenish from top down due to gravitational pull. However, space battles are conducted in zero gravity, with gems replenishing from all directions that the player can control. Board pieces consist of tokens that provide damage to enemies (black, numbers on them = points of damage); Power (red= weapons, green= CPU, yellow= engine, blue= shield); PSI tokens (purple); and Intel (white). This new gameplay element gives the game a whole new potential for strategy, as now you must predict what color gems will fall into the spaces vacated by the gems you\'ve just matched up. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li>Over 150 battles within story mode.</li> <li>The return of the incredibly addictive head-to-head match-3 puzzle gameboard battles that <i>Puzzle Quest</i> fans know and love.</li> <li>More control of the puzzle board as you manipulate the puzzle gems in zero gravity, controling the direction the gems refresh.</li> <li>Redesigned, hexagonal puzzle board that&rsquo;s easier for new players, but adds extra layer of strategy for pros.</li> <li>Collect a fleet of customizable spaceships which endow your player with new skills and abilities.</li> <li>Negotiate with factions, mine for commodities, hack leapgates, recruit crew members, acquire companion aliens, craft weapons, and more.</li> <li>Battle across the galaxy in multiplayer battles and compete for rankings in online leaderboards.</li> <li>Short easy pick-up-and-play battles, with incredible depth and RPG-style character building.</li> <li>Three distinct gameplay modes: single player story mode, multiplayer vs. battles, and instant action quick battles on the go.</li> <li>Wireless DS multi-card play available via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.</li> </ul> <b>Factions</b><br/> Because <i>Puzzle Quest: Galactrix</i> takes place in a universe filled with other space-based races, an ongoing knowledge of the in-game factions you will have to deal with is all important. As players make their way through space during mission play and during mini-games they will find that every planetary system, station, ship, etc. that they encounter has an affiliation to one of these factions. Some of these are human-based, but most are alien in nature. Good, or at least careful relations relations with these is critical to ensuring safe passage, optimal tariffs and support during conflicts. <br/> <br/><br/><br/>']","by

Deadliest Catch Alaskan Storm lets gamers captain their own boat in the frenzied search for an undersea jackpot. Gamers select one of five real crab boats, including the Northwestern, Cornelia Marie and Sea Star - all featured on the series, or create and customize their own boat. Gamers then recruit and lead their own crew from a roster of twenty real crab fishermen. Selecting the wrong boat or recruiting the wrong crew member can mean the difference between landing a Bering Sea jackpot or disaster. Lead your fatigued, hungry and hardworking crew in the strategic search for King Crab and Opilio Crab, while battling to secure your catch and livelihood before other captains and crews get to the crab first. The game was inspired by Sig, Edgar and Norman Hansen - three brothers who have made their living crab fishing on the Bering Sea aboard their family&#8217;s fishing vessel, the Northwestern. The Hansens and the Northwestern are featured on Discovery Channel's highest rated and Emmy-nominated series - Deadliest Catch.

When you do eat an energizer dot, Pac-Man can eat the ghosts for extra points. There are four of these type of dots on the screen, one in each corner of the maze. Another way to get extra points is to eat the fruit that bounces from time to time throughout the maze.\n\nWhen you have cleared the maze, you start the process all over again, this time with faster ghosts and a different kind of fruit.

Kids still need a vivid imagination but in today's tech-savvy world, they'll also need a 3-D graphics accelerator card. Racers allows players to build, customise and race both cars and drivers. Building is unlimited and there's 12 different tracks in a variety of settings to choose from.\nIt's an interesting exercise to compare the real-life elements to their electronic counterparts. Any LEGO fan will recognise infamous opponents from their plastic incarnations; Captain Redbeard, King Kahuka and Basil the Batlord are some of our favorites, and they're just as great-looking onscreen as they are in the toy chest kits. The level of hand-eye coordination required to build amazing cars is, we think, lower than with real LEGOS (and there's no dropping and breaking possible!). Parents don't need to buy a million different sets to get all desired pieces--they're all right there on the screen.\n\nWe found the racing arena to be a huge hit with arcade-game fans. The tracks are treacherous, the themes are wildly detailed and there's lots of hidden power-ups and shortcuts for when your skill level increases. If you think you've got all the tracks mastered, try them out in reverse. It's harder than you might think! Drivers, start your engines, because LEGO Racers is worth the ride. --Jill Lightner \n\nManufacturer's Description\nCustomise your LEGO car and LEGO driver, then challenge up to five other drivers in landscapes based on four LEGO SYSTEM themes.

The land of Zubalon is under siege by the evil Big Head and his army of Zubo clones, the dastardly Zombos. While traveling through the game in human form, players can befriend any Zubos they meet along the way, feeding and nurturing them, helping them gain skills and strength, assisting them in chasing off the evil Zombos and in the end persuading them to join your team in strategic battles with an innovative rhythm action mechanic. <p/> Action in <i>Zubo</i> is turn-based, with your team of up to three Zubos facing off against an AI or human-controlled team in multiplayer, of three Zubos. Each Zubo on your team begins the game with a particular set of battle moves. Most of these can be learned by any Zubo, but each character also possesses a unique move that can only be used by that character, making the strategy of the makeup of your team important as the game progresses. Executing battle moves is where the rhythm aspects of <i>Zubo</i> come into play. As a player begins a move an outline appears around the active Zubo which moves in tandem with the in-game music. As this outline meets the Zubo\'s body the player taps out the rhythm with the stylus to execute the move. More powerful moves require more complex use of the stylus, increasing the difficulty of the game as times goes on. With over 100 fully animated comedy battle moves, 10 areas with Zubalon to explore, plus a wealth of interactions and mini-games, <i>Zubo</i> offers a deeply rewarding Nintendo DS experience. This stylus-tapping adventure promises hours of entertainment kids (and adults) are sure to love.<p/> <b>Meet the Zubos</b><br /> <i>Zubo</i> features over 50 Zubos spread across the game\'s ten play worlds that players can interact with on all levels.

In fact, <I>EverQuest</I> features no solo or story-oriented game; <I>EverQuest</I> <i>requires</i>, and certainly encourages, interaction with the tens of thousands of other players online.

Elements such as race (over 12, including Dwarf, Ogre, Troll, Halfling, Gnome, Barbarian, Dark Elf, and Human) and class (over 14, including Bard, Magician, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior, and Wizard) determine your character's statistics and special abilities. For instance, the Warrior class of any race is inherently strong, though the Warriors of the Ogre race is much stronger than, say, the Warriors of the Halfling race.

Users may paste their own photographic portraits onto a range of skaters' bodies before selecting a costume and getting out onto the ice. Once there, players select music for a program, either their own imports or a song from the selections provided. A menu of options at the top of the screen offers skating moves: spins, jumps, spirals, poses, and transitional moves--everything you need to put together a medal-winning routine."", 'It is tempting to load your program with triple jumps and combinations, but be warned! Once you have put the program together, you have to skate it in competition--and there is no guarantee that you and your skater can make all of those jumps. A jump meter at the bottom of the screen moves every time you are setting up a jump. It is up to you to click your mouse at the right time to land the move. Click too soon or too late, and you will watch as your skater lands on her backside and your score plummets.', ""<i>Michelle Kwan Figure Skating</i> does suffer from a few tiny flaws. Getting your face perfectly centered on the figure skater's body is tricky. It also takes trial and error to develop routines that look truly smooth, there is no provision made for skater fatigue, and scoring is purely on technical excellence, failing to reflect the complexity of real-world scoring for this sport. While the other required moves for competition are included, there are no options for the intense and clever footwork sequences required in both long and short programs. However, these concerns will only be obvious to devoted skating enthusiasts, and are minor when set against the vast range of details this program does get right. Everything in <i>Michelle Kwan Figure Skating</i> is set up to put you--with only the tiniest bit of imaginative input--right there on the rink, skating for the judges and hoping to win gold."", ""Best of all, the illusion doesn't break once you have finished your program. Instead, the camera cuts to a shot of you and Michelle Kwan sitting together, surrounded by figure skating's obligatory flowers and stuffed animals while you wait for your scores. Score poorly, and it's back to the rink to fine-tune your routine and practice some more. However--if you win--you get a chance to see yourself on the podium with the other medalists, enjoying a brief moment of glory before moving up to the next level of competition. <i>--Alyx Dellamonica</i>""]","by
