Sega Master System 1 - Video Game Console,,"['8-Bit Cartridge Video Game Console System From Sega', 'Large Library of Games Available']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Master System', 'Consoles', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""The SEGA Master System is the videogame console that almost could. Despite its technical superiority to the dominant NES, the machine lacked just one critical thing: Mario. Without this icon and the emergence of Sonic the Hedgehog still five years on the horizon, the Master System ran a far distant second to the NES during the 8-bit generation -- the phoenix-like resurrection of videogames following the Atari 2600-lead industry crash.  The Master System was essentially a conduit for SEGA to get its arcade hits into the home. Even though the Master System did not have the horsepower to completely replicate the experience of SEGA's enviable stable of arcade smashes like OutRun and Space Harrier, there was no other place to play these games outside of an arcade. But SEGA also released plenty of great, original games for the console over its lifespan, including Alex Kidd in Miracle World and one of the greatest role-playing games of all-time, Phantasy Star. However, thanks to Nintendo's iron-grip agreements, few third-party publishers ever supported the machine and software came out at a very frustrating pace. Months could go by between major releases and that made a dud on the Master System feel even more painful.  One of the Master System's quirkiest (and coolest) features, though, was the 3D Glasses peripheral. The thick, wraparound shades may have looked a little clunky from the outside, but the effect was positively stunning. Sadly, like the Master System itself, the peripheral was under-supported with just over a half-dozen games, including Maze Hunter 3D and Space Harrier 3D.  Despite its narrow mass audience, the Master System had -- and still has -- a very loyal fan base. Thankfully, the thumping SEGA received with the Master System did not daunt its quest for the living room, leading to the Genesis, which corrected most of the Master System's mistakes and gave Nintendo a run for its money for the majority of the 16-bit generation.""]","by

RollerCoaster Tycoon 3  - Mac,,[],"['Video Games', 'Mac', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is a brilliant reworking of the classic management strategy game. An unlimited combination of roller coaster designs and landscapes to help you build the coolest park imaginable! Let your imagination run free using amazing rides, attractions and terrain modeling. A huge array of diverse guests in your park everyone is unique -- make sure they're all happy and you'll stay profitable. Respond to the individual likes and dislikes of kids, teens and adults Create pyrotechnic wonders with the incredible Fireworks MixMaster"", 'Released back in 1999, the original <i>RollerCoaster Tycoon</i> took the gaming world by surprise, managing to capture the attention of both hardcore gamers and casual novices alike. <i>RollerCoaster Tycoon 3</i> not only contains all of the same charm and joy of the original, but wraps it up in a spectacular three-dimensional package. You can now rotate the camera and zoom in and out, which allows you to more clearly see where a new ride will be placed, and exactly how it will fit in your park. The 3D rendering also shows height and depth, which isn\'t just a superfluous change but really assists you when building custom attractions. Who knew that constructing and running an amusement park could be so much fun? Now, for the first time you can build, operate, and ""attend"" the amusement park of your dreams in <i>RollerCoaster Tycoon 3</i>.', '<table align=right width=200 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/rct3-2-lg.jpg""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/rct3-2-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><i><b>Take a front row seat on any of your rides and zoom along with a pal. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/rct3-2-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</b></i></small></td></tr> <tr> <td> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/rct3-4-lg.jpg""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/rct3-4-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><i><b>And speaking of the pals -- they are completely personalized with unique facial expressions and behaviors. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/rct3-4-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</b></i></small></td></tr> <tr> <td> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/rct3-3-lg.jpg""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/rct3-3-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><i><b>Who knew that constructing and running an amusement park could be so much fun? <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/rct3-3-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</b></i></small></td></tr> </table> <i>RollerCoaster Tycoon 3</i> allows four modes of play: tutorial, career, sandbox, and custom scenario. The Tutorial mode lets you quickly learn and experiment with how to set up and make use of all the game elements. Sandbox mode provides you with a large map and unlimited money, and makes all the rides, scenery, shops, and paths immediately available. This mode is great for just having fun and creating that super amusement park you\'ve always wanted, without worrying about game elements such as time limits. The custom scenario, as the name suggests, lets you set up your own rules and requirements using the game engine. You can share custom scenarios with friends, or find ones that other people have created and posted online. The career mode that constitutes the main gameplay is a bit different than it has been in the past, with three goal sets of increasing difficulty for each scenario. Your job in career mode is to build the theme park of your dreams by accomplishing certain goals for each scenario. These goals can range from pleasing VIPs who like clean parks or coasters with certain excitement values, to keeping a certain number of people, referred to in the game as ""peeps,"" in your park for a specific amount of time. Your ultimate goal, besides providing entertainment to all, is to work your way from Apprentice, though Entrepreneur, and eventually reach the lofty heights of Tycoon.', '<i>RollerCoaster Tycoon 3</i> includes a host of nice-touch elements. There is a fireworks display, as well as an editor that lets you customize your fireworks. You can add music that plays in time to certain rides or with your fireworks show. You can light up the night with a stunning park-wide lighting system, or take in the breathtaking vistas as nature intended, with realistic sunsets, moonlight and more. There is even a Coaster Cam that puts you right in the action. You can take a front row seat on any of your rides and zoom along with a peep. (The camera does such an amazing job of showing you what your ""Death Spiral"" coaster feels like that you might not want to play until at least an hour after you\'ve eaten.) And speaking of the pals -- they are completely personalized, fully-animated individuals with unique facial expressions and behaviors. For example, teenagers often run straight to the high-excitement level coasters, while the younger kids like to stay on the more gentle rides, and the older folks tend to complain and chase both sets of kids around. You can even create your own family members and friends and add them to your park, where they will actually take pictures that will download directly to your My Documents folder.', ""There's also a lot of content to explore, as <i>RollerCoaster Tycoon 3</i> includes five separate themes, including Generic, Spooky, Western, Adventure and Sci-Fi. Each theme has distinctive rides, amusements and shops, as well as animatronics and decorations. The game's sweeping variety lets you do virtually anything, from setting up water rides that have mechanical great-white sharks lurching out of the water, to creating a roller coaster straight out of your imagination. There are 18 distinct scenarios in the game, with two that are only playable when unlocked. Beating the Apprentice level of difficulty on each of the initially unlocked scenarios will unlock a new scenario, but you have to beat the much more difficult Entrepreneur and Tycoon settings on all the levels to unlock the final two scenarios. When it comes to the creative aspect of the game, <i>RollerCoaster Tycoon 3</i> will allow players to create some spectacular parks with a level of detail they're sure to love. If you were a fan of the first two versions, you'll love this one. But if you never played the originals but love theme parks, you owe it to yourself to give <i>RollerCoaster Tycoon 3</i> a try.""]","by

Cool, that is, until a bogus bunch of neanderthal nerds crashed their village and scared off all the cave-babies. Now the cave-babies are out there-somewhere, lost and reeeeally lonely - so what are you waitin\' for? It\'s up to Joe and Mac to get \'em back.']","by

Like The Sims game that preceded it, which quickly grew to be on of the most popular PC games of all time, you create one or more autonomous characters (sims) with distinct personalities and needs. You then create a virtual household for your sims, deciding whether they're roommates, spouses, or parents, and you move them into a pre- or custom-built house and neighborhood. Your sims will interact with each other and other sims in their community, with children going to school while the adults head to work. <i><i>The Sims 2</i></i> features an enhanced neighborhood editor that lets you import custom cities from <i>SimCity 4</i> (not included), and it also includes expanded building options for building bigger houses."", '<table align=right width=200 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/sims2h-3-lg.jpg""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/sims2h-3-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><i><b>This sequel features enhanced appearance editing tools that allow you to customize your sims\' appearance. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/sims2h-3-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</b></i></small></td></tr> <tr> <td> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/sims2h-5-lg.jpg""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/sims2h-5-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><i><b>The genetics function takes your ability to create a family and builds it out further. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/sims2h-5-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</b></i></small></td></tr> <tr> <td> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/sims2h-4-lg.jpg""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/sims2h-4-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><i><b>Let your sims celebrate New Year\'s in style with a fantastic party. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/sims2h-4-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</b></i></small></td></tr> </table> The most significant additions in <i><i>The Sims 2</i></i> are the behavioral and character enhancements made to the sims themselves. While sims still have specific personality types determined by their horoscopes and adjustable individual characteristics -- such as neatness, niceness, and playfulness -- sims now have some notable major new features, such as memories, genetics, aging, and the new aspiration/fear system. This sequel also features enhanced appearance editing tools that allow you to customize clothing, hair styles and colors, and even lets you make adjustments to facial features. The genetics function takes your ability to create a family and builds it out further, letting sims pass on genetic information to their children. When creating a family, you can now have the game randomly generate children based on their parents\' appearance and personality, though you can still edit those children. You can choose to re-create a real-life couple or family to see what kind of genes get handed down from generation to generation. Or you can experiment by interjecting some DNA from an alien into the family tree, as <i><i>The Sims 2</i></i> includes the ability to create aliens from outer space and even marry them off to your more outlandish sims family members.', ""Another adjustment to <i><i>The Sims 2</i></i> is the application of the aging and aspiration/fear systems. While the aging systems consequences are fairly obvious and straightforward, the aspiration/fear system can actually help your sims stave off old age. This new system allows you to choose one of five aspirations for your sims, including building a family, earning money, seeking knowledge, experiencing romance, or being popular. These aspirations are immediately realized by four simpler goals that get displayed onscreen, as well as three basic fears. Each sim has an aspiration meter which can fill up as you complete goals, or empty out if your sims' worst fears come true. Goals can be as immediate as throwing a successful party, or as long term as eventually winning over other sims as friends or spouses. Fears can be equally straightforward or long term, such as the fear of being rejected or getting fired from work."", 'Just as in life, if enough fears are realized, your sims lose their aspiration and go temporarily insane, although fortunately for your sims a therapist usually shows up. During this period of insanity, your sims can become unresponsive, ignoring orders you may be giving. However, if your sims successfully complete their goals, they earn more aspiration points, causing their meter to progress from green to gold and eventually platinum. The higher your sims\' aspiration meters reach, or the longer they stay in the platinum range, the longer your sims remain as ""normal"" young adults.', 'The 40 new holiday objects included in <i><i>The Sims 2</i>: Holiday Edition</i> allow you to celebrate several holidays in style. From Halloween objects, to firecrackers, wallpaper, presents, tree decorations and more, you can let your sims celebrate New Year\'s or even invite Santa Claus over for supper. And there is even a new movie-making feature that lets you ""film"" your sims in action and save the video to your computer. <i><i>The Sims 2</i></i> even looks great, powered by a powerful three-dimensional graphics engine.']","by

The game is set between Episode III and Episode IV of the Star Wars series. This real-time strategy takes place in the wake of the Jedi slaughter that has disrupted the balance of the force. Players wage ground and space battles all in an effort to gain control of the galaxy. All of the gameplay and action within Empire at War is persistent, meaning that strategic and tactical elements from previous events will have a permanent effect on the galaxy.', ""<i>Star Wars: Empire at War</i> is a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game that is, quite simply, amazing in its scope and grandeur. This game has all the elements that both hard-core <i>Star Wars</i> fans and dedicated strategist gamers are looking for. In <i>Empire at War</i>, you must fight battles in space and on the ground, giving the game a dual-layered design that forces you to operate on both an involved strategic level as well as a tactical level. Add epic-looking battles with dozens of great touches, outstanding sound effects that you've come you've come to expect from LucasArts, the contrasting play styles enabled by playing as either the Rebellion or the Empire, and a broad array of unforgettable characters, and you've got a game that lets you truly immerse yourself in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe."", '<table align=right width=250 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/swempire-6-lg.jpg""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/swempire-6-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><i><b>Land battles are highly enjoyable and extremely challenging, involving heavily armored AT-ATs and more. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/swempire-6-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</b></i></small></td></tr> <tr> <td> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/swempire-3-lg.jpg""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/swempire-3-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><i><b>Fight epic-looking battles in space with outstanding sound effects you\'ve come to expect from LucasArts. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/swempire-3-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</b></i></small></td></tr> <tr> <td> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/swempire-5-lg.jpg""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/swempire-5-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><i><b>As a player, you\'ll be involved in virtually every aspect of the conflict between the Rebels and the Empire. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/software/detail-page/swempire-5-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</b></i></small></td></tr> </table> The storyline of <i>Star Wars: Empire at War</i> occurs between the two trilogies through the end of ""A New Hope."" As a player, you\'ll be involved in virtually every aspect of the conflict between the Rebels and the Empire. You must simultaneously manage your economy, develop technology, build factories, planetary defenses, ships, and space stations, as well as get information on new planets and maneuver your various forces around the galaxy. Unlike some strategy games that are decided by who has hoarded enough resources to overwhelm the enemy, here it is just as important to build your forces up in an intelligent fashion in order to gain power. And to ensure you aren\'t ever allowed to sit back and relax, it all happens in real time, so if you spend too long considering what to build or where to send your fleet, you\'ll be inviting a computer attack that could reverse your gains.', ""<i>Star Wars: Empire at War</i> has a huge number of variables you'll need to consider. Many planets have unique bonuses, such as allowing certain units to be created more powerfully or cheaply, thereby increasing your credit income by different degrees, as well as only allowing the largest ships like Mon Calamari cruisers and Imperial Star Destroyers to be built on certain planets. And the Empire and Rebels obviously both have their differences. The Empire usually generates a lot more money, which it can use to overwhelm the rebel forces if left unchecked. The Rebels, on the other hand, have far fewer resources, which can make them more difficult to play and learn, but they can steal technology and sneak raiding parties past many of the Empire's space defenses. And each of the two sides has their own distinct Hero units, which can be extremely powerful and can sway the course of battle greatly. You can use Palpatine or Mon Mothma to reduce a planet's production costs; C3PO and R2D2 to steal technology or hack into an enemy's turrets and turn them against their own troops; Darth Vader to force-push entire groups of enemy soldiers on land; or Boba Fett to crush concentrations of fighters by dropping seismic charges in space. To balance out these massive powers, both sides can hire generic bounty hunters to try and eliminate a rival hero from the game."", ""While the land battles in <i>Star Wars: Empire at War</i> are highly enjoyable and extremely challenging, involving heavily armored AT-ATs and more, the space battles are truly breathtaking. Watching a Star Destroyer crawling with bright-blue ion energy, or an entire wave of X-wings explode into flame, or witnessing a fully-armed and operational Death Star blow a planet to smithereens are unparalleled experiences in this galaxy, or any other. And the visual and sound effects aren't the only thing that will amaze you during a space battle. The bigger units like space stations and Star Destroyers all have hard points pertaining to different systems. You can target these different systems to cripple ships in different ways, taking out their shield generator, weapons system, or engines to reduce their effectiveness, or taking out the hanger on Imperial capital ships to thin out their fighter cover. And as you destroy a cannon or shield generator, that piece will break off and float away. And while most ships eventually explode, the Mon Calamari Cruisers and Imperial Star Destroyers will actually tear in to pieces that continue to linger throughout the battle. What's more, you always need to watch out for ships the AI (artificial intelligence) might be hiding in asteroid belts, waiting to spring them on the flanks of your fleet at the worst possible moment."", ""The strategic layer of <i>Empire at War</i> takes place on a two-dimensional galactic map showing you all the planets. In the full campaign mode, you must consider and plan around more than 40 such planets, whereas in some of the simpler conquest scenarios, you may end up dealing with as few as eight of them. Instead of playing in the campaign mode, you can play multiplayer matches over a LAN or online with up to eight players. The LucasArts' matchmaking system makes finding an opponent easy, and if you are playing a head-to-head match against a friend, you have the ability to save a match and reload it to continue at a later time. Delivering a presentation that is as epic as the films themselves, <i>Star Wars: Empire at War</i> is ideal for any fan of strategy games, and absolutely necessary for <i>Star Wars</i> aficionados.""]","by

Plus, you'll find many new high-level dungeons to explore in Azeroth, Outland, and elsewhere that will substantially boost gameplay. There are new flying mounts in Outland; tons of new and dangerous monsters (including epic world bosses); hundreds of new quests and items; and even a new profession: Jewelcrafting. Of course this isn't the end of the list -- this is just a glimpse of what Blizzard has planned for their unreleased expansion pack."", '<strong>The New Story, the Rumors, and More</strong><br /> Several years have passed since the Burning Legion\'s defeat at Mount Hyjal and the races of Azeroth have continued to rebuild their once shattered lives. With renewed strength, the heroes of the Horde and Alliance have begun to explore new lands, and have broken through the Dark Portal to investigate the realms beyond the known world. In this expansion pack, <em>The Burning Crusade</em> refers to the Burning Legion\'s ongoing efforts to destroy life on Azeroth. To date, the Burning Legion\'s exploits have been documented in <a href=""../exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V9Q1/${0}"">Warcraft III</a> and in the <em>War of the Ancients</em> novel trilogy. As part of the expansion pack, players will now be able to travel through the Dark Portal to confront the Legion on otherworldly battlefields.', 'Although only one race has been revealed, Blizzard has announced plans to unveil details about possible additional races at a later date. On the other hand, many details have been released about the new continent, Outland. Players last visited Outland in <a href=""../exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AKXXT/${0}"">Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne</a>, alongside Illidan as he conquered the Pit Lord Magtheridon\'s domain. Players will also gain access to Quel\'Thalas, the region to the northeast of the Forsaken lands, where the Blood Elves reside. Blizzard says that this expansion pack holds even more new areas that are ripe for player exploration -- additional details will be revealed in the months ahead.', ""Blizzard also has plans to add new dungeons and battlegrounds with the expansion, though the exact number has not yet been determined. One upcoming dungeon that has players excited is Karazhan, which is located within Medivh's tower. Because Medivh has played such a central role in Warcraft lore, Blizzard is convinced that longtime players will be especially interested in seeing what Karazhan contains. As for battlegrounds, Blizzard has released very little information. However, they have announced plans to make some of the battles from the past accessible through the Caverns of Time."", ""<strong>Blood Elves: The New Race</strong><br /> Thousands of years ago, the exiled Highborne landed on the shores of Lordaeron and founded the enchanted kingdom of Quel'Thas. These high elves, as they called themselves, created a fountain of vast, magical energies within the heart of their land -- the Sunwell. Over time, they grew dependant on the Sunwell's unstable energies, regardless of the bitter lessons they'd learned in ages past."", ""During the Third War, the villainous Prince Arthas invaded Quel'Thalas and reduced the once-mighty realm to rubble and ashes. His undead army decimated nearly all of the high elven population. In addition, he used the Sunwell's energies to resurrect a powerful undead Lich, Kel'thuzad, thereby fouling the Sunwell's mystical waters. The few elven survivors, realizing that they had been cut off from the source of their arcane power, grew increasingly volatile and desperate."", 'In the midst of the elves\' darkest hour came Kael\'thas Sunstrider, the last of Quel\'Thalas\' royal bloodline. Kael, as he was commonly known, knew that the remnant of his people would not long survive without the nourishing magic that once empowered them. Renaming his people ""blood elves"" in honor of their fallen countrymen, Kael taught the survivors how to tap into ambient mystical energies -- even demonic energies -- in order to sate their terrible thirst for magic. In search of a new destiny for his people, Kael\'thas ventured to the remote world of Outland where he encountered the fallen night elf, Illidan. Under Illidan\'s watchful eye, Kael and his blood elves regained much of their former power.', ""Unfortunately, the blood elves practice of embracing demonic energies caused their former comrades in the Alliance to shun them. Thus, the remaining blood elves on Azeroth look desperately to the Horde to help them reach Outland where they can reunite with Kael'thas and achieve the golden destiny he has promised them."", ""<strong>Outland: The New Continent</strong><br /> Once the beautiful homeworld of the orcs, all that remains of Draenor is the scattered wastes of Outland. Following the Second War, the Alliance invaded Draenor by crossing through the Dark Portal. To their horror, they discovered that Ner'zhul -- the dark warlord of Horde -- had constructed a series of new gateways that could lead the beaten Horde to newer, unspoiled worlds. As the Alliance forces closed in around him, Ner'zhul opened his gateways as a means of escape. However, his plan backfired and the gateway's clashing energies resulted in a massive catastrophic explosion that ultimately ripped the world of Draenor to pieces."", 'Nearly thirteen years later -- towards the end of the Third War -- the fallen night elf, Illidan, discovered that huge chunks of Draenor still existed, floating upon the astral winds of the Twisting Nether. After his defeat at the hands of the evil Prince Arthas, Illidan fled to the remnants of Draenor and dubbed them ""Outland."" He quickly seized control of the chaotic region and sealed the last of Ner\'zhul\'s gateways.', 'Though he is the undisputed ruler of the ravaged land, Illidan lives in fear that he will be discovered by his powerful enemies -- most notably Arthas, the new Lich King, and the remaining Lords of the Burning Legion. For now, Outland is home to a number of scattered draenei tribes, primitive orcs, and powerful, arcane creatures of the Nether itself. Agents of the Burning Legion have also targeted the region as a vital strategic location in their unending Burning Crusade to scour all life from the universe.', ""What else can expected? Blizzard has tantalized Warcraft players with the brief glimpse into <em>The Burning Crusade's</em> storyline. Will these heroes find friends or foes?

What is also intriguing is the ability to resolve the entire conflict through diplomatic means rather than by force -- a trait that sets this game apart from most WWII strategy games. Players can trade weapons and secrets with allies to strengthen themselves as well as their alliances.', 'This game is reminiscent of the classic WWII board game, Axis and Allies, but has the additional advantages of the computer platform -- more complexity, and real-time gameplay -- that keeps the action non-stop. One particularly unique aspect of <i>Hearts of Iron II: Doomsday</i> is your ability to play from more than just the traditional ""big boys"", such as the US, UK, Russia, Italy, Japan and Germany; in fact, you can play as any one of 175 countries. You also have the option of which year to start and what specific missions to try, which is especially important as the only way out, other than by winning, is by surrendering.<P> It\'s also important to choose which technological path to take, rather than simply assigning certain strengths based on your choice of side or nation. Technology is broken down into different categories, such as Air Doctrine, Land Doctrine, Armor and Naval units, as well as the classic and sometimes all-important Secret Weapon programs. In order to make technological progress, you\'ll need to assign teams to work on specific projects, many of them based on real historical programs. Each team has different sets of skills that allow them to work on different projects, while each project focuses on a different field. The expanded technological tree in <i>Hearts of Iron II: Doomsday</i> even allows you to develop nuclear weapons. Another important factor in this game is diplomacy, in which your choice of allies can say as much about you as who your foes are. The all new diplomatic options and intelligence system lets you steal and sabotage equipment, control mass media, start riots, and even assassinate ministers and leaders. <br clear=""all"">']","by

You interact with 10 species of Electroplankton by using the Nintendo DS touch screen. When you come in contact with the Electroplankton and elements of their environment, the microscopic merrymakers give off a unique sound. The sounds will ring familiar with you, from a piano and percussion instruments to your own voice.', ""Interacting with each Electroplankton is a bit different, although you'll always use the touch screen, microphone, or both. Some Electroplankton yield percussion sounds, others resemble a piano and still others sound like they've been put through a synthesizer."", 'Some even come with their own beats. Rec-Rec is an Electroplankton that allows you to record your voice over a track of eight rhythms from house to industrial. You can overlay four of your own additions to these rhythms and slow down or speed up the beat.', 'Then you have Nanocarp, who are less about making music and more about responding to your sounds. They change formations based on your input into the microphone. Nanocarp reply to clapping, blowing into the mic, and you singing ""Do Re Me"" to them.', 'Beatnes replicate the sounds of some classic NES games that struck a cord with <i>Electroplankton</i> creator Toshio Iwai. You can make your own melodies or re-create sounds from Super Mario Bros., Kid Icarus, an NES Collection, and robot sounds.', '<i>Electroplankton</i> offers a fun and amazingly creative way to actually put yourself inside the game. You are the conductor, and a new world of musical composition has opened up for you to explore.', ""The great thing about <i>Electroplankton</i> is it works on a variety of different levels. The precision of the Electroplankton's movements can help you create fantastic compositions, or you can take a more recreational approach and play with the different movements and sounds and just have fun with it. If you're savvy with recording equipment, you can use the DS's headphone jack to output your composition and record it for all the world to hear."", ""Bottom line: <i>Electroplankton</i> is one of those rare artistic games that should be part of every gamer's collection.""]","by
