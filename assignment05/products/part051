Although this was done primarily as a passenger, this notoriety along with her skill in the air quickly lifted her to the level of celebrity, author, symbol of the changing roles of women in society and spokesperson for the expansion of commercial air travel. Fame and personal drive also led her to achievements in competitive air racing and long-distance flying, including altitude and solo cross-country records, nonstop flights between Mexico City and New York, as well as Hawaii to the mainland, and most famously multiple solo nonstop transatlantic flights, for which she won the Distinguished Flying Cross. Eventually, in June 1937 along with a new larger, more powerful plane, she took aim at an around-the-world flight that at 29,000 miles, was the longest attempted up to that time. Disappointingly, the first attempt was scrapped after the first leg due to technical difficulties, but only months later and with a single additional crew member Earhart took off on a second attempt. A month into the trip, which included many stops, things appeared to be going well, with the vast majority of the planned route completed. Yet the remaining distance to be covered was over the vast, mostly landless Pacific Ocean. With this in mind, the US Coast Guard vessel Itasca was assigned to aid the flight with radio navigation to Howland Island, a US possession in the northern end of the South Pacific. Although transmissions were received from Earhart, and her navigator, their plane never reached Howland Island and search efforts turned up nothing. What happened to Amelia Earhart? The world has wondered ever since. <p/> <b>Story and Gameplay</b><br/> In <i>The Search for Amelia Earhart</i>, players take on the role of Psychic Christine Barker. A fictional contemporary of Amelia Earhart, Christine having drawn inspiration from the exploits of the aviator has established herself with the Chicago police department as an expert at finding things. Using this ability players follow Amelia Earhart&rsquo;s life through space and time and tackle the mystery of her disappearance. The game features multiple levels, including a tutorial level, in which they are tasked with finding objects hidden both in plain site as well as others that are layered in the gameplay environment. The game also contains a robust hint system, in-game activities sometimes necessary to find objects, as well as mini-games, including puzzles, jigsaws and a coordinate plotting game which reveals geographical positions as objects are found, used or combined using the inventory system. Players can choose from either a timed or untimed gameplay mode and are awarded a series of trophies depending on their level of success throughout the game. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Addictive point-and-click, hidden object gameplay across eight levels, that feature both timed and untimed play modes.</li> <li>Playing as Psychic Christine Barker, locate and assemble the hidden clues to help unfold Amelia&rsquo;s story and, ultimately, unlock her mystery.</li> <li>Solve 5 mind-bending mini-games.</li> <li>Plot coordinates using the Coordinator Locator to discover the places Amelia visited around the world.</li> <li>Explore 32 scenes in order to find clues and reveal the missing links to Amelia&rsquo;s disappearance.</li> <li>Trophy system based on levels achieved, game/mode completion, in-game activities and more.</li> </ul> <h4>System Requirements</h4> <table border=1 cellpadding=""3"" width=""51%""> <tr> <td width=""21%""></td> <td align=center width=""79%""> <b>Minimum</b></td> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""21%"">OS:</td> <td align=center width=""79%"">Windows XP, Vista</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""21%"">Processor:</td> <td align=center width=""79%"">Pentium IV 2.0 GHz (AMD equivalent) or faster processor</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=""21%"">RAM:</td> <td align=center width=""79%"">512MB or more</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=""21%"">Disc Drive:</td> <td colspan=2 align=center width=""79%"">2x or faster CD/DVD-ROM drive</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""21%"">Hard Drive:</td> <td colspan=""2"" align=center width=""79%"">200MB or more</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""21%"">DirectX:</td> <td align=center width=""79%"">DirectX 9.0 compatibility</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""21%"" height=""26"">Video Card:</td> <td td colspan=""2"" align=center width=""79%"">64 MB DirectX 9.0 video card</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""21%"" height=""26"">Input Device:</td> <td td colspan=""2"" align=center width=""79%"">Mouse and keyboard</td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Max is a three foot ""rabbity thing"" with a saw blade grin and the impulsive nature of the average piranha. Together they patrol the sticky streets of a fantastical New York City, righting wrongs, pummeling perps, and ridding the urban landscape of the shifty legions of ""self-propelled gutter trash"". Join Sam and Max, the Freelance Police, on a bizarre journey &ndash; from the North Pole to the Fountain of Youth, from outer space to Hell and back &ndash; in the acclaimed second season of gaming&rsquo;s first episodic sitcom, <i>Sam &amp; Max: Beyond Time and Space</i>. Zombies will dance. Mariachis will sing. A giant battle robot will trash the streets. And when their friends are caught in the crossfire, Sam &amp; Max will risk their very souls to set things right. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Sam &amp; Max: Beyond Time and Space</i> is a horizontally and vertically oriented, single player, point-and-click game. Players act primarily as Sam, with Max assuming the role of a wisecracking sidekick, who occasionally has dialog choices in interactions with other characters and more commonly with Sam. As the game\'s five episodes proceed players face a series of puzzles and/or bosses that must be solved/defeated in order for Sam and Max to physically move to the next area and make progress towards the solving of the overall mystery. Solutions to these are generally logical, or at the least based in clues found in play. Gameworld areas are reached via Sam\'s classic Desoto cruiser and are filled with items and characters that can be interacted with, and which are called out as such when the player\'s cursor is placed over them. Different dialog and character actions are made available at that point. These choices often lead to the discovery of items or hints that will be needed later on.

The one thing this civilization left behind was MILO - the sentient artificial intelligence designed to act as caretaker for their planet while they were gone and guard for the Keys to the Gateway.\n\nMILO has existed now for centuries. patiently awaiting the return of his creators.

Created with help from many Airbus pilots and Air Berlin it is what Aerosoft believes airliners in FSX should be. Directly aimed at the user who likes to fly and not to spend too much time on configuration and pre-flight checks but who does not want to compromise on the modeling and features, this aircraft will appeal to a large group of flight simmers. <br><br>The fully functional Virtual Cockpit puts you in a fully immersive environment where detailed animations (all with sound effects) and a high level of detailed modeling show the level of details that separate FSX from FS2004. All the displays are detailed and easy to read even at lower resolutions and show how most A321's are now leaving the factory. While leaving out the most complex (and least used) functions of the computer systems, the actual operation of the aircraft is highly accurate and as easy and logical as Airbus designs its aircraft. The displays will automatically show you the information you most need at any given moment. The Fly-By-Wire flight model is totally reliable and extremely close to the actual aircraft. Where older aircraft use conventional throttles, the Airbus has a realistic FADEC system that means you almost never have to touch the throttle after you started your take-off run. <br><br>The external model is highly detailed and very smooth. All cabin and freight doors can be operated and show the interior of the aircraft. Animation of the flight control surfaces is accurate both in timing and movements. <br><br>""]",Aerosoft,"['>#199,084 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#26,710 in Video Games > PC Games > PC Games']",$40.00,Video Games,B003QP44Z8

But they soon learned the hard way: playing with your food is never a good idea. Not only did the insects quickly evolve and become immune to the new crops, but something else happened. New &#39super-breeds&#39 of insects emerged, and it wasn&#39t long before they became the dominant race on the planet.', 'Hominids (what&#39s left of the devolved human race) were less fortunate. With the consumption of genetically engineered foods, they became increasingly allergic to their surroundings over time. Despite obsessive planning for all kinds of potential disasters, no one saw this &#39pollen threat&#39 coming. Their allergic reactions soon became lethal, as one beautiful spring day the flowers bloomed, and they literally began swelling up and sneezing themselves to death by the billions. Formerly a thriving human metropolis, Troi survived what was now referred to as The Great Evolution and the resulting wave of insectification that swept through. The city underwent a spectacular metamorphosis, transforming into a buzzing new capital. It&#39s a six-legged world now, but with this renaissance came the price that rapid success can bring: indifference, corruption and crime.', 'The Insecticide Squad from Precinct 47 is a rag-tag team of aging detectives well past their prime, who remember what Troi was like in the good ol&#39 days. Chief Chigger knows his squad&#39s best days are behind them and they\'re losing ground - crime is on the rise, and this makes him even grumpier than usual. Just when he&#39s resigned to the idea of retiring in a city where crime has him beat, he gets an idea. He gives his last semi-competent detective, Roachy Caruthers, an order. He wants him to assemble a team of new blood to beef up their squad. Novices Chrys Liszt, Hexelrod &#39Hex&#39 Bloombug, and Eugene &#39Grubbs&#39 Grubbowski are paired up with the veteran detective and set out to bring the mighty boot of justice down hard on the infestation of crime that scuttles the streets of Troi. A murder at the powerful Nectarola Soft Drink Company leads the team on a bug hunt through the city&#39s seedy underbelly, and into a mystery of epic proportions. Follow Detective Chrys as she&#39s drawn into a web of corruption. Only through the use of her unique insect abilities, a range of creative bug weaponry, old-fashioned street smarts and a little help from Roachy, can she hope to uncover the truth. It&#39s a gooey job, but someone&#39s gotta do it. </P> <ul> <li>Put your detective skills to the test and lead a crime investigation in a futuristic world of mutant insects and film noir locations. Collect clues to solve a gripping mystery brimming with twists, turns, and double-crossings.</li> <li>Use specialized weaponry and unique insect powers to shadow your suspects or confront them head-on.</li> <li>Collect and convert radioactive pollen from the environment to assemble a variety of unique, organic-based weapons.</li> <li>Interrogate suspects, interview witnesses, and play good cop/bad cop to get the info you need.</li> <li>A cast of nearly 30 unique characters.</li> </ul> <div class=""break""> </div> <h5>System Requirements</h5> <table style=""width: 100%"" border=1 cellpadding=""3""> <tr><td width=""18%"">&nbsp;</td><td width=""40%""><b>Minimum Specifications:</b></td><td width=""40%""><b>Recommended Specifications:</b></td></tr> <tr><td width=""18%"">OS:</td><td colspan=""2"" align=""center"">Windows XP / Vista 32 Bit</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Processor:</td><td align=""center"" width=""40%"">1.5 GHz CPU</td><td align=""center"" width=""40%"">Unknown</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">RAM:</td><td align=""center"" width=""40%"">256 MB</td><td align=""center"" width=""40%"">Unknown</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Hard Drive:</td><td align=""center"" width=""40%"">600 MB</td><td align=""center"" width=""40%"">&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Video Card:</td><td align=""center"" width=""40%"">Video Card with Per-Pixel Shader 2.0</td><td align=""center"" width=""40%"">Unknown</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Additional Info:</td><td td colspan=""2"" align=""center"">Unknown</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Supported Video Cards at Time of Release:</td><td td colspan=""2"">Unknown</td></tr> </td></tr></table> <td width=""30%""> <table align=right cellpadding=""10""> <tr><CENTER><div><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B003RWSIIE.Insecticide1.160.jpg"" alt=""Insecticide"" height=""160""></CENTER><div class=""imageCaption""></div></div></tr> <tr><CENTER><div><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B003RWSIIE.Insecticide2.160.jpg"" alt=""Insecticide"" height=""160""></CENTER><div class=""imageCaption""></div></div></tr> <tr><CENTER><div><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B003RWSIIE.Insecticide3.160.jpg"" alt=""Insecticide"" height=""160""></CENTER><div class=""imageCaption""></div></div></tr> </table></table></td></div>']","by

Humans suffered terribly in the constant combat between the two, combat which shook the universe to its very core. In order to ease this suffering, the Enlightened banished the divine power of the Dark One, imprisoning it in a stone, known as an Artifact, but at a price. Inseparably linked, where one of the divine beings went the other was bound to follow and so the power of the Enlightened was captured in a matching Artifact. Together the two were hidden away and peace, as well as balance was restored to the universe. But peace is a fragile thing. It is said that any human who comes in contact with the Artifacts will be cursed and the power of darkness will once again be awakened. Enter the game\'s heroine Ayumi. As the game begins a map which has been lost for countless years suddenly turns up and it shows the location of the artifacts. Unaware of the curse, the adventurer Ayumi searches for and finds the immensely valuable stones, releasing powerful forces in her body.

Test Drive Off-Road 2,,['1 Player'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['There must be a large segment of racing game fans out there who like to race dirty (as in ""the dirt"" dirty), because Pitbull Syndicate and Accolade are back with Test Drive Off-Road 2, the sequel to last year\'s mudslinging racer. In Off-Road 2, you can choose from 20 rough-ridin\' vehicles to mow your way through the Rockies with. You can select from the game-exclusive Humvee, a Jeep Wrangler, Dodge Ram, Ford Explorer, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and more. However, some of these trucks are only available after you\'ve won certain races, so you\'ve got to choose carefully from the outset which truck best suits your driving style, if you want to advance. Spread out over six different real-world localities are 12 different tracks. The tracks contain all sorts of natural hazards like snowdrifts, sand, trees, mud pits, and boulders, all of which put your driving aptitude to the test at just about every turn. While you are able to try a limited selection of single races, the real challenge lies in the world tour mode. The world tour mode is divided into five classes: Hummer, Safari, SUV, Truck, and Military. You are only able to use that specific type of vehicle in each class (makes sense, right?), essentially forcing you to learn the ins and outs of each vehicular category. By beating each of these classes in either first, second or third place, you\'ll earn points. After you\'ve earned enough points, you\'ll unlock extra tracks. Ultimately, you\'ll unlock the Open class, which is the final level before you beat the game. Thankfully, with each successful victory you\'ll be able to use the credits you\'ve earned towards purchasing better vehicles. Surprisingly enough, Test Drive Off-Road 2 winds up being a better-playing racing game than Test Drive 5. The vehicles in Off-Road handle considerably better than you\'d think, given the often dodgy characteristics of the tracks themselves. Control is bettered by using the Dual Shock analog pads, but you may want to turn off the rumble action, since it seems fairly indiscriminate, lacks subtlety, and gets annoying quickly. Graphically, the game holds up pretty well, with nice truck models and decent (if sprawling) track design. The frame rate stays at a nice clip and never gets too bogged down despite the presence of three to five other cars onscreen at the same time. The music is negligible, despite the inclusion of tracks by bands like Gravity Kills and Fear Factory, and the sound effects are OK but nothing great. Basically, the game is pretty good, but the most surprising exclusion in the game is the lack of a two-player mode. You\'d think that this sort of thing would be automatic at this point, but it\'s not in there. That means all you dirt devils out there will be riding solo, whether you like it or not. So, before you go and blow your hard-earned money on this decent little game, try renting it first.<i>--James Mielke</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the developers at Ubisoft Reflections have included a plot twist that throws the series on its ear: the entire game takes place in the fevered dreams of a comatose John Tanner. The resulting freedom of movement allows for the aptly named &quot;Shift&quot; mechanic, which lets players exit their current vehicle, float above the scene, and switch to other cars in real time. Gamers can use this feature for any number of purposes, such as jumping from a pursuit vehicle into an oncoming car to cause a head-on collision, or making a 90-degree turn at full speed by simply shifting into a car heading in a perpendicular direction. Driver: San Francisco makes several more departures from series tradition, beginning with the inclusion of more than 100 licensed vehicles inspired by classic Hollywood films like Bullitt and Vanishing Point. Gamers can speed around more than 200 miles of Bay-area streets in Alfa Romeos, Aston Martins, and even DeLoreans, but they can&#39;t get out of the car and run along the road, as was the case in some previous entries in the series. And for the first time in a Driver game, players can head online for nine different modes of multiplayer competition. Driver: San Francisco also supports local split-screen multiplayer action, and the &quot;Movie Maker&quot; mode returns, allowing gamers to record car chases with Hollywood-style visual effects, and then upload them online.&nbsp; This Game is a Region Free PAL Game Imported from the UK.

Up in the sky! It\'s a bird! It\'s a plane! It\'s a . . . lovable animal-herding UFO! In Flock, players take control of an alien UFO that is tasked with herding animals to its mothership through a variety of interactive levels. Players will have to overcome the stubbornness of the temperamental beasts (this may require the use of fear, or amorous yearnings, etc.), as well as a series of environmental puzzles that must be solved using Flock\'s physics-based gameplay. By finding or making a passable route, players can herd the animals safely toward the ship. Solving the puzzles within the suggested time limit yields exciting rewards. But players can also take their time to find more hidden bonuses. With a unique theme, clever humor and easy pick-up-and-play controls, Flock promises to be an instant hit with gamers of all ages!<br /><br />The game is played from a third-person top-down perspective. Users take control and pilot the UFO around a series of small ""plushie"" islands surrounded by water. The animals that populate these islands - sheep, chickens, pigs, cows and more - respond to the UFO in all kinds of quirky ways based on their nature. The challenge is to take advantage of these behaviors in order to help guide the animals to the mothership and rack-up points. If all else fails, there\'s always the tractor beam!<br /><br />Flock uses a sophisticated physics engine that drives the challenging puzzle elements of the game. Whether it\'s using the Tractor beam to move obstacles out of the way, or the Depressor beam to stamp out crop circles to guide your herds, being an extraterrestrial has never been this addictive. Friends can also join in through co-op play. And when all the levels have been completed, users can make their own with the level editor that comes with the game.

Phantasy Star Portable 2 (PSP),,"['Emilia Percival : The protagonist of the story. A 16-year-old human girl (later on 17) that is one of the members of Little Wing. Has an innocent and bubbly (badly put, naive) personality, with strong tsundere tendencies. Starts off as an ordinary member, but later gets dragged into a saga that would change her life completely. She does not talk about her past and there are no records of it either. She mentions that her age is just an estimation, she might be one or two years younger than her stated age. Her default weapon is a rod. In the aftermath of the battle, while telling Mika not to go, she calls her ""mother"". She gets officially adopted by Kraz and Ursula in the ending, thus changing her name to Emilia Muehler instead. In the True ending, Emilia along with Main Character are heading to an unknown destination, hoping to be reunited with Mika.', ""Kraz Muehler : A 34-year-old Beastman who is both the leader of Little Wing and Emilia's guardian. Despite his position, he is mostly seen as an irresponsible old man (old man as called by Emilia) who likes to read erotic magazines. He is also somewhat dense as he threw away the present Emilia got for him, not realizing it was a present meant for him. However, he can show a serious side to him when the situation calls for it. He cares for Emilia a lot but he does not show it on his face. Once an esteemed, famed detective, but one would not know just by looking at his face. He lost his family in an incident years ago. Marries Ursula in the ending. His default weapon is a pair of handguns (Twin Handguns category)."", ""Yut Jun Yunkers : A 15-year-old Newman boy who is from the Kasch tribe. Emilia encountered Yut on the planet Moatoob while on a mission, and he attacks them (with Main Character, Tonnio and Liina) all of a sudden. He was defeated and Emilia decided to save him and bring him to Little Wing's headquarters. While Yut was unconscious, the home of the Kasch tribe was razed to the grounds by Shizuru Shu's group. Unofficially became a member of Little Wing when he woke up, after Emilia treated him to delicacies he had never tasted before (especially pudding which he seemed to have taken a liking to), thinking that they are people that he can trust. Shares a sibling-like bond with Emilia. He lacks common sense because he lacks proper upbringing and education, so he tends to behave instinctively, much like a beast. It is revealed that he's a half-Newman, half-Beast as a result of his parent's heritage (A Beast father, and a Newman mother). He stated himself that many people said that his Newman blood seemed to be stronger, giving him slightly more Newman-like physical features while he has the more physically fit features of the Beast as well. His signature weapon is a spear, while he's shown using a bow in the opening movie of the game."", ""Lumia Waber : The 17-year-old younger sister of famed GUARDIAN and hero, Ethan Waber. Originally appeared in Phantasy Star Universe as a 13-year-old civilian who becomes a GUARDIAN-in-training during the story. She now works in the GUARDIAN's Investigation Unit, and while on a mission encountered Emilia's group. She doesn't like Emilia and vice-versa upon their first meeting, but later on sees her as an equal and friend (more of a rival) after they worked together to rescue the people in said mission. Respects and is very proud of her brother a lot, but at the same time, feels pressurized by the weight of the Waber name because people kept comparing her to Ethan. Specializes in TECHNIC usage as shown during her entrance cutscene in Phantasy Star Portable 2. Her signature weapon is a rod as well, further showing her intended position as Emilia's friendly rival."", 'Ursula Laurent / Mika / Shizuru Shu / Chelsea']","['Video Games', 'Sony PSP', 'Games']",{},"['Phantasy Star Portable 2 takes place three years after the events of Phantasy Star Universe, all four races defeated and sealed off the SEED.

(Expansion courses sold separately.) <P> Unlimited screen resolutions and up to 16.7 million colors unlimited resolutions means that <I>Links LS</I> can match any monitor's maximum viewing capabilities (even 1600 x 1200 and higher). Up to 16.7 million colors means the finest in near photorealistic quality possible."", ""Golf sims are few and far between on the Mac. Sure, they abound for the PC, but only Access Software consistently ports its strong Links series. And while this Links LS trails a year behind the PC version, it's still the best golf action on the Mac today. <P>Links LS is as real as it gets without a tee time. First off, the players are video-captured 3D golfers. Just choose one of four likenesses: two males, one female, and one golfing legend - Arnold Palmer (no minority players, unfortunately). The players even make comments, albeit lame ones, during play, and you can record your own colorful interjections. <P>The game's shining feature is the courses. Links LS highlights three new championship rounds, all of which have video flybys, histories, and even 3D tours of select holes. Start with the tour of Kapalua Village in Maui, Hawaii. It's a forgiving course where the holes are wide and the par 4s short. Once you've mastered The Village, load Kapalua Plantation, where accuracy is key, or the Latrobe Country Club, Palmer's home green near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Both courses offer challenge and play very well. <P>The last Mac version - Links Pro - looked good, but Links LS looks outstanding. Gaze on lush, green trees; soft, puffy clouds; richly textured mountains; varying degrees of shadows; and even the stripes created by lawn mowers. These details can be seen at many screen resolutions, including a whopping 1,600 x 1,200 pixels with 16.7 million colors. View the courses from a variety of camera angles, including customized views, to get the perfect perspective. <P>The downside to all these stellar graphics is redraw time. With the details set to high, it takes an average of nine seconds to redraw the screen after every shot. Turning the detailing to low cuts this time in half, but the wait still adds up. And anyone lacking the 150MB of hard disk space needed for a full install of Link LS faces an even longer delay as the game accesses the CD-ROM drive. <P>Don't be deterred; Links LS is worth the wait. The gameplay is improved from earlier versions, with more accurate ball dynamics (although still not perfect) and better swing meters. Plus, you now can play one of four different golf games: stroke, match, best ball, and skins. It's a fun game with a firm place atop the golf sim leader board. - Dean Renninger <P> <B>Good News:</B> Beautiful, richly detailed graphics. Better gameplay. Supports high screen resolutions. Good network and Internet play. <P><B>Bad News:</B> Ball dynamics aren't perfect - yet. Slow redraw times.

Comfortable padded ear cups']",{},"[""On the battlefield, often the key to victory isnt firepower but communication. Any seasoned first person shooter player knows all too well that the usual path to defeat is not being able to hear what other players are saying, as well as having to shout for teammates to hear you. Which is especially frustrating when you disturb the household as a result. This becomes even more bothersome when wearing uncomfortable headsets for longer periods of gameplay. CTA Digital's Gaming Headset is designed to address these factors, and provide a comfort that can last through even the longest of challenges. The Gaming Headset connects to a monitor with standard RCA stereo jacks (red and white) and directly to the PS3's USB port via separate cables, thus allowing users to manipulate the volume of in-game audio and chatter independently with the remote. Not only does this allow for a finely tuned and completely customized audio experience, but the audio quality itself is rich with the dynamic base that all serious gamers crave. You can finely hear subtle details that will give you the competitive edge, or simply enjoy extended play sessions thanks to the carefully-designed comfortable padding. This headset is ideal for casual and pro gamers alike. Specifications: Compatible with PS3 for game audio and chat. Compatible with any display that utilizes RCA cables (red and white) for stereo audio. Wired remote with control wheel for game audio and chat. Sensitivity:108dB+3dB (headphone). Frequency response: 15Hz-20KHz (headphone). Microphone: 6X5mm. Frequency response: 15Hz-20KHz (microphone). Sensitivity: -40dB+3dB (microphone).

In this setting, the Dutch fleet consists of 11 ships lead by Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge while the Portuguese fleet has 20 ships lead by vice-roy Martim Afonso de Castro. Even though the Dutch lost this battle, it was enough to convince the Sultanate of Johor to support the Dutch in the Dutch-Portuguese War, and eventually end the Portuguese supremacy in the region. </li><li><i>1st Cape Finisterre</i> - The First battle of Cape Finisterre was fought between the British and the French in the year 1747 and was a part of the War of the Austrian Succession. In this setting you\'ll find 7 British warships attacking a 15-ship French convoy. The British fleet is commanded by Admiral George Anson while Admiral de la Jonquiere is commanding the French fleet. The British victory ensured the promotion of George Anson to Vice Admiral. The French summoned a bigger convoy later, which lost another battle at the Cape Finisterre, leading to the end of French naval operations for the rest of the war. </li><li><i>Battle of San Juan de Ulua</i> - The battle of San Juan de Ulua was fought between English privateers and Spanish forces in the year 1568. In this setting the English privateers have 5 ships commanded by John Hawkins and the Spanish forces have 3 ships commanded by Francisco Lujan. The privateers were anchored at San Juan de Ulua for repairs and resupply when a Spanish escort fleet arrived in the port. Because of a treaty between the two nations the privateers were not afraid for their safety. However, the privateers had been plundering for a full year and Lujan was aware of this and swiftly attacked the privateer fleet. Swift attack and the capture of the island&#39s bastion ensured the Spanish victory. </li></ul></P><div class=""break""> </div> <h5>System Requirements</h5><table style=""width: 100%"" border=1 cellpadding=""3""><tr><td width=""18%"">&#xa0;</td><td width=""70%""><b>Minimum Specifications:</b></td></tr><tr><td width=""18%"">OS:</td><td width=""70%"">Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7</td></tr><tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Processor:</td><td width=""70%"">2.0 GHz Core Duo or equivalent</td></tr><tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">RAM:</td><td width=""70%"">2 GB</td></tr><tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Hard Drive:</td><td width=""70%"">Unknown</td></tr><tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Video Card:</td><td width=""70%"">A card with 256 MB of dedicated memory with support for pixel shader 3.0.
