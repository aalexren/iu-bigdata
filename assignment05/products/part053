NIRA Intense Import Drag Racing - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""When I first heard about NIRA Intense Import Drag Racing, I was pretty jazzed. After all, it was created by Bethesda, which gave us Burnout - one of the best (and one of the few) drag-racing simulations ever for the PC. And I naturally assumed that Bethesda would have used the time between Burnout (which was later renamed Hot Rod Championship Drag Racing) and NIRA Intense Import Drag Racing to rectify everything that had kept Hot Rod from being a Grade A product - like providing native Windows support, making the manual more user-friendly, improving the interface, and beefing up the game's VCR features. <P>However, it turns out that NIRA Intense Import Drag Racing is little more than an add-on pack for Hot Rod Championship Drag Racing designed to run as a stand-alone product. I'm thankful that Bethesda at least kept the sticker price low ($19.95), but the bottom line is that everything that had kept Hot Rod from introducing drag racing to the gaming masses is still alive and kicking in this latest incarnation. <P>The only real difference between NIRA and Hot Rod are the cars. Instead of rails, funny cars, and souped-up stock cars, you get to drag race imported cars like a Mitsubishi Eclipse, Toyota Supra, Honda CRX, Acura Integra, BMW M3, Porsche 911, and a couple of cars that were apparently taken from NIRA teams. It's beyond me why someone would want to race these cars on a drag strip - it seems as though they'd all be better suited to a type of racing that would take greater advantage of their handling capabilities - but apparently some people are into it or there wouldn't be an NIRA in the first place. There are only ten cars total in NIRA, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for; on the upside, there are 20 tracks featured in the game, a few of which were sites of 1998 NIRA events. <P>Some modifications have been made to the Hot Rod game engine to reflect the sort of setup options made available by these types of cars. Just as in the first Bethesda drag-racing game, the number of ways you can tweak your car's performance is vast to the point of being overwhelming to all but the most savvy mechanics and drivers. To be fair, the manual does touch on all the bases, but no attempt at all has been made to make the manual more accessible: The instructions have the same turgid prose and reams of complicated information that almost made me comatose back when I played Hot Rod. <P>Where NIRA really shines is out on the track, and while figuring out the complexities of drag-racing rules and coming up with that perfect engine and chassis setup can take a while, you'll be rewarded with some extremely intense action against some very strong computer opponents. But you'll eventually get the itch to race against human opponents. Unfortunately, the fact that this game isn't Windows 95-native means the only way to find competition on the Internet is on that old workhorse, Kali. Bethesda is throwing support behind the Simulated Hot Rod Association, and there's even a Kali site specifically for SHRA. However, it's still disappointing that a racing sim released in 1999 doesn't offer the option for direct TCP/IP connections; instead, it asks you to spend an additional $20 for a gaming network whose reason for existence passed with the arrival of DirectX's multiplayer support. <P>Other areas that remain unimproved include the game's flaky control setup and limited VCR functions. I lost count of the number of times I assigned important functions to a joystick button (the game only recognizes four-button controllers, by the way) only to enter a race and find that it may or may not work. Watching replays is pretty fun, but it'd be a lot more exciting if you could hear the sounds of the engines or rotate, pan, and zoom the view for the best angle of a major crash. <P>I learned to live with all of these same annoyances in Hot Rod and wound up enjoying the game enough to give it a fairly high score. And of course there's something to be said for the NIRA's low price tag and the fact that you can race import cars. But if you're just a casual drag-racing fan, you're better off picking up a copy of the original Hot Rod Championship or waiting on Bethesda's upcoming IHRA Drag Racing.<I>--Stephen Poole</I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

One of the most noticeable changes was the extensive use of military helicopters both for transportation and fire support in landing zones. The war in Vietnam became the first military conflict where helicopters played a significant role.

Origin Stories relate primarily to the combination of the chosen race of the character and that individual\'s socioeconomic status. For example, a player who favors a Dwarfish character may have a variety of options, including the choice of being a commoner or a noble. As the character progresses through the game he will interact with any number of non-player characters (NPCs) who may have a particular opinion of Dwarves which may or may not be altered by the fact that the character is of noble or commoner status. These built-in impressions, blended in real-time with the character\'s interactions and choices alter the hero\'s personal path and eventually the outcome of the events of the game. <i>Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening</i> is the expansion to <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i>, players of the previous game are afforded the added benefit of importing their character from the original game to continue that adventure, or beginning anew with a new character and Origin Story. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>A Stunning World Expanded</b> - BioWare&rsquo;s deepest universe to date just got bigger with an all new area of the world to explore, Amaranthine.</li> <ul> <li>Unlock the secrets of the Darkspawn and their true motivations.</li> <li>Rebuild the Grey Warden order and establish their base of operations at Vigil&rsquo;s Keep.</li> </ul> <li><b>All-new Complex Moral Choices</b> - Embark on an epic story that is completely defined and reactive to your play style, allowing players to create an entire experience based on both overall choices made and how complex situations are handled.</li> <li><b>The Varying Influence of ""Origin Story""</b> - Begin your character\'s adventure with a specific socioeconomic Origin Story that will affect attitudes and exchanges with NPCs, creating the possibility of a wide variety of game endings and thus add to the game\'s replay value.</li> <li><b>New Ways to Customize Your Hero</b> - Experience additional spells, abilities, specializations, and items to further personalize and customize your hero and party.</li> <ul> <li>Import your character from <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i> or start anew as a Grey Warden from the neighboring land of Orlais.</li> <li>Encounter five all-new party members and an old favorite from <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i>.</li> </ul> <li><b>Even more Bone-crushing, Visceral Combat</b> - Test your skills against an evolved, intelligent breed of Darkspawn and other menacing creatures including the Inferno Golem, \'Queen of the Blackmarsh\' - deadly Spectral Dragon and The Children, a hideous and huge arachnid like scourge.</li> </ul> <h5>EA DISCLAIMER:</h5>', 'Acceptance of end user license agreement required to play.

Players control mobile suits on the side of the Earth Federation or the Zeon and venture into missions where swords are swung and beam weapons are fired to complete various objectives. In addition to search and destroy missions, there are also escort mission and protection missions as well where a base or ship is guarded from attack. The original Gundam Battle Tactics is still our favorite game in the series with its perfect control and varied missions but the entire Gundam Battle series is built on the original game engine from Battle Tactics. That means perfect controls, challenging missions, and fluid action as mechs jump-jet and clash on city squares, deserts, and even underwater. Players of Gundam Battle Chronicle may transfer data over to Gundam Battle Universe and the wireless mode allows for multiple players to engage in Versus campaigns. To round out the feature set, a Gallery Mode includes a library of Mobile Suits featured in the game, a full Character roster of heroes such as Ray Amuro and Shiroh Amada, Background information on the Gundam mythos, and a collection of Illustrations. The War Record keeps track of your battlefield performance and the Gundam Museum features BGM tracks to listen to.   <BR><BR>        * More than 200 Gundam mobile suits for players to pilot around the missions<BR><BR>      * Players could transfer data from ""Gundam Battle Chronicle"" to ""Gundam Battle Universe""<BR><BR>      * Control mobile suits on the side of the Earth Federation or the Zeon<BR><BR>      * High-speed Ad-hoc battles with the universe\'s most powerful Gundam fighters<BR><BR>      * Japan Import [Asian Version] Region free- for any PSP']",Bandai,"['>#148,049 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#1,603 in Video Games > Sony PSP > Games']",$75.29,Video Games,B003GAL9PG

Players steer by leaning left or right, as on an actual skateboard or snowboard, and perform special moves with well-timed balance shifts. Modes of play include ""Trick,"" ""Point Rush,"" and ""Challenge,"" and multiple difficulty settings are available. Players can create their own custom characters, or ride as pro skateboarders such as Tony Hawk, Lyn-z Adams Hawkins, and Corey Duffel, and snowboarders including Travis Rice, Louie Vito, and Olympic Gold Medalist Torah Bright. Xbox 360 gamers can also import their avatars into the game as playable characters.

A map-driven adventure, you will travel across over 100 unique locations, battling monsters and completing nearly 200 daring quests. Taking the place of traditional RPG dice or number generators is a customizable, magical slot machine &ndash; however there is no gambling. <i>Battle Slots</i> harnesses the excitement of popular Slot Machine mechanics, progressing your adventure through fantastic gameplay. Spinning the slot machine yields Magic Points, Attack Points, Experience Points, Gold, and Summons.', 'Magic Points and Attack Points are used to cast techniques that yield devastation upon monsters throughout the world of Tellus. Experience Points allow you to gain levels and boast higher Health, Attack, and Magic Point totals. The Gold earned can be used in the world to upgrade the Academy and the Zoo or purchase Runes, Techniques, or Slot Symbols. When the slot machine pays out a summons, the creature called for will appear and cast it&rsquo;s effect. These summons may stun opponents, deliver gold, or place Wilds throughout the reels of your slot machine. Techniques affect combat in a variety of ways. Some will damage your opponent, others will stun them. Some techniques will allow you to heal yourself in battle, increase strengths, or become resistant to damage. Slot machine related techniques will offer extra spins or Wilds as you collect new Slot Symbols and Runes.']","by

Watch your animated 3-D tokens hop, skip, and race around the board. Your mission, as always: bankrupt your opponents, and try to stay out of jail.', 'I know what you\'re thinking: ""It\'s Monopoly; how hi-tech can it be?"" As unlikely as it may sound, Westwood has transformed Parker Brothers\' classic board game into a box full of highly rendered, smoothly animated, multiplayer goodness.', 'Even in single-player mode, Monopoly shines as a brilliant example of what programmers can do with a simple concept if they set their minds to it. Attached to all game pieces, board locations and events are beautifully rendered 3-D animations--over 800 in all--that faithfully recreate the game\'s early 1930s appeal. The soundtrack is pleasant, though it can get annoying over the duration of what are often lengthy competitions. Besides the window dressing, Monopoly also offers everything you\'d expect from the board game: money, extensive trading options that allow players to wheel and deal properties, and even ""Get Out of Jail Free"" cards.', ""Monopoly's greatest feature is its carefully designed multiplayer support.You can challenge up to five other players in either network or Internet mode. If none of your friends are ready to play, check out Westwood's Internet waiting room, where you'll find other players from all over the world who are looking for a game. (Yes, the game will even sort out differences in language and currency types.)."", ""In the end, even with all the bells and whistles, Monopoly is Monopoly, and if you don't like the board game, you won't like the computer adaptation. But if you're a fan, Westwood's take on the venerable classic is a great way to compete with players all over the world from the comfort of your own home. <i>--Trent C.

You've been betrayed and left for dead. Now you're taking revenge, unless the city gets you first. Mob bosses need a favor, crooked cops need help and street gangs want you dead. You'll have to rob, steal and kill just to stay out of serious trouble. Anything can happen out here.

He will meet characters such as Axel Blaze, an extremely talented striker with a secret, and pit his skills against players like Jude Sharp, a playmaker for the rival Royal Academy team.\nCaptivating anime sequences enrich the storyline in this adventure and players are able to explore the town in the game to hunt for potential team mates. There are over 1000 in-game characters which you can scout, each one with their own statistics, unique skills and special abilities. In addition if you connect to Nintendo Wi-Fi connection there are over 50 additional characters that can be recruited to your team. It is up to you to craft a team from your players with the abilities that support your strategic approach to the game.\n\nOnce the football matches begin  the action kicks in. There are two types of matches to play in the game: either full eleven player teams battling on a standard sized pitch, or 4-on-4 challenges which pit the player against specific tasks such as scoring or gaining possession of the ball. During the match your Nintendo DS stylus will come into its own when you control your hand-picked team. You will challenge your reaction and dexterity as you determine the strategy that your team takes to press opponents, cut passes, perform slippery sliding tackles and of course score goals.\n\nYour players can even utilise multiple fantasy moves to turn the tide of a game! From special dribbles and water waves, to flying ice kicks and shooting a football fireball!']","by

Its development was announced in March 1999 and it was first released on March 4, 2000, in Japan. The PS2 is the best-selling console of all time, having reached over 150 million units sold as of January 31, 2011. This milestone was reached 10 years and 11 months after the system was released in Japan on March 4, 2000.

Just you, the game's greatest players, and the world's most magnificent golf courses. Play for fun or play to win!"", 'Considering the high quality of the PGA Tour games from EA Sports, the latest version, PGA Tour Pro, is a disappointment. While it\'s full of interesting and unique features, not all are executed particularly well. <P> PGA Tour Pro enters a genre thick with competition, yet still claims bragging rights on a couple of key points. First, tournament play is still the best on the PC, due to the PGA Tour relationship. You actually golf against pros Davis Love III, Tom Kite, Fuzzy Zoeller, Craig Stadler, Mark O\'Meara, Jeff Sluman, Jim Gallagher, Brad Faxon, Peter Jacobsen, and Chip Beck, complete with swing and reaction animations. In tournament mode, this makes play really come alive. <P> The second strong element of PGA Tour Pro is the smooth implementation of Internet play via EA Sports Net. The player-matching service is actually integrated into the game, needing nothing more than an active TCP/IP connection. Inside EA Sports Net, competitors can set up games for up to four people online at once, and worldwide competition for prizes is in the offing. Online text and audio chat is supported. This beats the Jack Nicklaus Online Tour, the Virtual Open (for British Open), and Links LS to the punch. <P> The game itself has some problems. Since its last incarnation in 1996, it has been substantially redesigned. It is now Windows 95 native, and the expected step forward in graphics and redraw times is indeed present. But while the graphics are visually quite lush, they are also curiously flat: terrain and trees don\'t pop out the way they do in Links LS or even Jack Nicklaus 4. Inscreen animation has been added, but it is also quite screwy. The waving flags are fine, but the ocean looks like something from a grade-school play: part of it is animated in choppy waves, and the other part is motionless, with neither color palette matching. Sounds are the weakest part of the production, with adequate ambient sound, but poor ball noises. <P> As with the previous version, the variety and quality of camera angles is tops. Ball cam, blimp view, reverse angles, and all kinds of cameras are available on the course. Only two can be open at once, but you can rotate and move the view to achieve practically any angle you need. Greens are hard to read, but a new method has been added to aid shot making. Instead of just the standard grid option, you can also choose putting lines: a row of arched lines radiated out from your golfer to help read greens. Figuring out the best way to use them may take some time, but this new approach shows promise as an alternative to the grid, which has never worked that well. <P> Swing control has gone down a notch with a redesign of the swing bar. It\'s still a three-stage power bar, but instead of wrapping around the player, it\'s represented by an almost old-fashioned circle in the lower right-hand corner. A new ""risk meter"" has been incorporated into a portion of the power bar. When you design your shot, the risk meter gauges its chances of success on a bar from green (an easy shot) to red (a hard shot), perhaps included for people who absolutely must know their chances of success. <P> Shot making and club selection is unsatisfactory. When you aim your shot, the computer almost invariably picks too much club as your default. You must pick a shot type, pick a club, and aim the shot - in that order. If you aim and then pick a club, the aiming arrow changes. If you pick a shot, say a chip, you automatically get a default club. In the case of a chip, this is always the seven iron. It is a terrible way of handling shot design and makes for maximum confusion. (British Open still has the best shot design features.) Ball physics, especially in sand and rough shots, are modeled well - though wind effects could be better. <P> Three course come with PGA Tour Pro: Pebble Beach, TPC Scottsdale, and Bay Hill. Each is recreated quite accurately and offers a perfect variety of challenges and terrains. Previous PGA Tour courses can be used in the new version, and more are expected. <P> PGA Tour Pro offers just about everything you could want in a game, but it doesn\'t always do it very well. It has some strong elements and will probably become the choice for Internet gaming because of its matchmaking service. But while it was once a series that lead the category, it\'s now just one of the pack. <i>--T. Liam McDonald</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.
