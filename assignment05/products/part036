el's enemies look a little plain and that texture maps on the scenery can split at the seams from time to time. The camera angle can get confusing as well - but all these are negligible nuisances in what's an otherwise incredible-looking game. Yet in spite of its graphics, Soul Reaver's strongest technical achievement must be that the game never, ever pauses to load new scenery, a feature that will spoil you the next time you try to play just about any other action game. <P> Of course, while the scenery around Raziel will change constantly, he himself remains a constant. Fortunately, he's animated and articulated so well that you won't mind looking at his emaciated body and tattered wings as much as you might expect. Control is tight and responsive either with keyboard or game pad, and in fact, it's a real pleasure to watch Raziel lithely jump, climb, crawl, and fight - almost as much as it's a pleasure to hear him speak. Just as in Blood Omen before it, the quality of Soul Reaver's professional voice acting is matched only by the quality of its script. Characters like Raziel and Kain come alive through their speech, and Raziel's embittered conversations with his brothers make the subsequent battles feel all the more meaningful and epic. An appropriate soundtrack spurs you into action during such fights, while it inconspicuously plays in the background at all other times, though you may start to notice it becoming repetitive. <P> The soundtrack's repetition becomes evident only when the gameplay itself surrenders to routine, which happens rarely but with increasing frequency over the course of Soul Reaver. Raziel has a remarkable array of talents that should have precluded this game from ever slowing down: He can jump five times his height, he can practically fly, he has superhuman strength, he drinks souls, he shifts planes, and he's completely immortal. While these abilities come into play more often than not in Soul Reaver, at other times Raziel is reduced to such menial tasks as arranging blocks in obvious patterns to unlock doors. Some of these block puzzles are fun, while some of them are not, but there's really no question that the game has too many of them. <P> And although you wouldn't expect to lose a fight if you were immortal, Raziel's few types of foes rarely pose a threat or present any challenge. Before he acquires the Soul Reaver weapon, Raziel at least needs to think about how to dispose of his enemies using appropriate anti-vampire methods, such as throwing them in water or sunlight or burning or impaling them. But his spectral sword lets him slay his victims almost effortlessly, to the point where you'll reminisce about how you used to get by without it. <P> Fortunately or unfortunately, combat isn't frequent in Soul Reaver. More often than not you'll be working your way through the environment in search of Raziel's brothers, taking heed of your powers and weaknesses as you progress. All the while, Raziel's gifts of immortality and plane-shifting allow for unique and clever puzzles and challenges, even as they justify the elimination of frustrating save-and-reload scenarios so common in most 3D action games, in which death comes swiftly and often. Raziel gradually acquires certain powers, such as swimming and phasing through doors, but his basic skills - running and jumping - are ultimately his strongest. <P> By the end of the game you'll feel that you're relying on Raziel's peripheral abilities too often and that the action that made the first half of the game so outstanding has been almost completely replaced by badly contrived puzzles. It's practically obvious that more effort went into the first hours of Soul Reaver than the last, and it's true that the game's abrupt and entirely unsatisfying ending sequence was the consequence of a decision to cut the game short and leave room for a sequel. Apologists would argue that the game's anticlimax merely enforces your empathy for the tortured, fratricidal protagonist. But while the steady decline of the game's initially near-perfect pacing will assuredly dampen your overall experience, that doesn't change the fact that Soul Reaver is original, enjoyable, and an excellent game by any standards except its own. <i>--Greg Kasavin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Tomb Raider Gold - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Here are extra challenging levels and even an alternate ending to the instant-classic 3-D adventure game starring Lara Croft. You have heard the legends. Lara Croft bursts onto the international scene as the star of the stunning, instant classic, 3-D adventure game <i>Tomb Raider</i>. ""Unfinished Business"" provides two expert levels of Lara\'s dramatic return to Atlantis. Lara has discovered the existence of a ruined segment of the alien city, allegedly containing a hive of surviving creatures guarding an alien hatchery. In this new adventure she must destroy the aliens before they invade again.', 'Lara Croft, the protagonist in Tomb Raider, has become a sort of unwitting spokesperson for Eidos\' new computer adventure. As the cover girl for just about every hard copy gaming magazine this year, this globe-trotting, gun-happy lass had become the matron saint of a new revolution in 3D gaming before the title even hit the shelves. But does the game really live up to all the buildup? Well, seeing is believing when it comes to Tomb Raider, and playing the game with the Rendition or 3Dfx chip, which are sure to find a home soon in every serious gamer\'s computer tower (a supportive patch will be available online for these), should almost be a prerequisite. Featuring several stunningly rendered 3D worlds and many a cliff-hanging moment, Tomb Raider makes gamers pay for the whole seat, even though they only need the edge. <P> As mentioned above, in Tomb Raider you play Lara Croft, a female Doc Savage who, tired of her wealthy English upbringing, has decided that dangerous adventuring is more her cup of tea. So she abandons a life of crustless cucumber sandwiches and piano lessons, eventually meeting a wealthy tycoon who hires her to retrieve a single artifact from a ruined temple in South America. After getting the artifact, you find out that the tycoon has sicked a bunch of her henchmen on you, and that the original piece you were sent in to retrieve is one of three hidden in various unplundered tombs around the world. <P> Your adventures take place in several ""seven wonders"" scenarios, from Egyptian sphinxes, to Greek temples, to Atlantis (what game would be complete without it?), each with distinct puzzles and traps to negotiate. <P> In each level, you\'ll have to beware of the different predator animals, unidentifiable creatures, and henchmen lurking around. In many instances, you\'ll be pounced on unexpectedly by wolves, lions, gorillas, raptors, and gangling ""lava-monsters."" Lara has to execute daring rolls, jumps, and side-leaps to dodge these predators while attacking them. This is no time to join the wildlife preservation society; endangered species or not, you\'ve got to slay these pests. Sometimes, at the end of a level, you\'ll have to go up against of the ""boss"" monsters, which range from a lumbering Tyranosaur to a huge ""torso-man"" who, if he snatches you with his giant mitts, will slam you around like a rag doll. <P> So, you\'re asking, what weapons can I use on these poor crypt-dwellers who are simply trying to sustain themselves in a sealed-up tomb? With a tap of the spacebar, Lara draws out her two revolvers which automatically target any man-eating creature in the vicinity. Other more effective weapons are picked up throughout the game, including a set of magnums, a shotgun, and an Uzi. Rounds for your default weapon are unlimited, but ammo for the other weapons has to be picked up. <P> But killing is only half the fun in Tomb Raider, as Lara can perform a variety of actions to explore each eerie environment. Often you\'ll have to make Lara swim through convoluted caves to secret rooms (incidentally, this is some of the most realistic swimming movement you\'ll encounter in any game). Each level has a series of switches that you need to activate, some of which require you to heave huge blocks around and - this is probably the most fun part of the game - execute daredevil leaps to grab onto some faraway platform. <P> Tomb Raider is the exploratory game you always wished you were playing when you were trying to solve Atari Raiders of the Lost Ark.The variety of jumping and grabbing actions, the huge, sometimes vertigo-inducing worlds, and the smooth 3D graphics found in Tomb Raider are reminiscent of Mario 64, though the game\'s violent overtones and spooky ambiance definitely set it apart from the older title. On the down side though, some of Tomb Raider\'s puzzles are tedious, requiring the player to wander around a little bit too long. Graphically, it\'s a breakthrough game, but to obtain the spellbinding graphics that really make the gameplay a complete experience, you\'ll need one of the cards mentioned above. The avid 3D game enthusiast will probably shell out the extra bucks for one, especially if Quake is a resident game on her machine. <i>--Tim Soete</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Created with an enhanced version of the Unreal engine, <i>Wheel of Time</i> mixes first-person 3-D action with strategy and even a bit of role playing. The huge world in which <i>Wheel of Time</i> takes place is lifted directly out of Jordan's pages. How you navigate the world will depend largely on whether you're in single-player or multiplayer mode. In the single-player game, the story centers on Elayna Sedai, the Keeper of the Chronicles of the White Tower. Her goals in the single player experience are unique, and, as you work to achieve them, you'll uncover the seeds of motivation in the other three characters (the Leader of the Children of Light, the Forsaken, and the Hound). These characters become more fleshed out in the multiplayer game. The multiplayer game is your chance to take up the mantle of any of these characters. The important thing to remember, though, is that the other characters view you as an enemy.

Packaging may differ slightly from the stock photo above. Please click on our logo above to see over 15,000 titles in stock.', ""The difficulty in reviewing a game like Unreal is keeping in mind what has come before it while at the same time allowing the game to flesh out its own sense of style and gameplay. Unreal is not Quake. The look is different. The feel is different. And what gives Unreal an edge is how these differences, while not always positive, distinguish it from the legions of other 3D shooters. <P> In Unreal, you are a prisoner aboard a ship en route to a penal colony. The ship crashes on a mysterious planet where the mystical Nali race is being subjugated by the cruel and technologically advanced Skaarj. As you journey through the many environments on the planet, you must find a means of escape from the planet and help the Nali defeat their oppressors. Unreal intertwines the feel of the medieval Nali architecture and culture with the sci-fi design of the weapons and the Skaarj warriors to create an environment that's a step above other games of its ilk. <P> As far as the game itself, the graphics are incredible. Unreal has the best graphics of any first-person shooter - and possibly of any game - to date. The palette is bright and varied, while the textures are intricate and well defined. The quality of textures deserves high praise - they help create environments that really take hold of you. The levels are so detailed and distinct that it's easy to distinguish one level from all the others, and you won't confuse the prison spacecraft for the Nali village. In conjunction with the graphics, the level design is advanced and complex. The mix of wide-open spaces and cramped hallways is refreshing. As far as graphics go, you just can't beat Unreal's immersion factor. <P> Combining an alien world with weapons that seem alien themselves has produced some interesting results. As varied as the ten weapons are, there's also an alternate method of firing each of them (the 8-Ball Launcher, Unreal's equivalent of a rocket launcher, can also be used as a grenade launcher). This wide range of attack styles will undoubtedly produce higher degrees of strategy in deathmatch play. As for single-player, the weapon placement and location was spaced out evenly, and finding ammunition was not a daunting task. <P> One of Unreal's best features is the enemy AI. In other games, the logic of certain creature actions seems to be linear and undefined. In Unreal, each opponent attacks with its own style, using a combination of melee and ranged attacks. One of the most impressive experiences (if not the most aggravating) was seeing a well-placed rocket shot miss because a Skaarj dodged it at the last second. Another eye-catching sight was watching different enemies power up shields to protect themselves in the midst of battle. <P> As far as problems go, there are some, but they don't hurt gameplay enough to reduce the overall experience. The first is that there are too few enemy model types. Unreal has only six main enemy models, but the design team has done a pretty good job of using different skins to create a variety of opponents. In addition, there are other models for the random critters that you fight throughout your adventuring. <P> Another complaint deals with the pace of gameplay. Sometimes the pace of action seems too stretched out, and it feels as if each battle is just the same as the last. However, these gaps were few, and for the most part the game pacing and plot development were enjoyable. On the puzzle-solving side, there isn't much to be had; most of the game you simply push buttons to open a path leading to the next level. But your actions involving them are well integrated into the plot. There are few complex puzzles to solve; it's doubtful that Unreal would benefit from more in that area. <P> Lastly, the weapons are pretty cool, but there's no simplicity in design. Each gun takes some practice to understand its use and benefits, but in the end, you spend too much time learning. Rather than give you instinctual weapons (like a basic shotgun or machine gun), Unreal's unusual weaponry forces you to adjust the way you play, without much added benefit of weapon ferocity or visceral gratification. <P> If you're looking to hone your deathmatch skills, however, you're going to find playing online to be next to impossible. The developers have stated in the readme.txt file that the game is still in the tweaking phase as far as Internet play is concerned. But with seemingly boundless game customizability options as well as in-package deathmatch levels, Unreal gives you everything you need to practice for the big time. It even gives you a choice of bots designed by Steve Polge to test your mettle. This was probably one of the most enjoyable features, and after you've finished the game you can go in and set up your own games for a single-player deathmatch experience. <P> Unreal is a truly great single-player game. It's hard to say whether it will stand the test of the first-person action-shooter wars and become a classic in and of itself. It will definitely have to overcome the lack of a decent Internet experience if it wants to obtain any more accolades, but, apart from that, it offers as much as you could possibly want from a game in this genre. <I>--Tahsin Shamma</I><BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Over 10 years in business - huge software selection, excellent customer service!', 'Last year NovaLogic released F-22 Lightning II, a diverting arcade-like sim that made inflated claims for the realism and accuracy of its flight model. After F-22 hit, NovaLogic managed to cement a relationship with Lockheed Martin for the rights to create sims based upon its aircraft, attempting to shut out other manufacturers in the process. (NovaLogic later denied that it was trying to freeze out the competition, but its initial releases featured the phrase ""exclusive rights"" prominently.) When the flight sim community rose up in outrage over this (particularly in light of NovaLogic\'s complete inability to create a flight model more realistic than that found in, say, Descent), NovaLogic backed off. But it still had this swell deal with Lockheed and needed to start making it pay out. <P> F-22 Raptor is the result. It is essentially F-22 Lightning II reissued. The radical differences in the two games made a whole new release essential. Differences such as the ""Lockheed Martin Fighter Series"" label on the box and, um, let\'s see. Oh yeah, the textures don\'t pop as much. And, er, well, it is native Windows 95. There\'s MMX support. The interface art looks a bit different. I\'m reaching here, folks.... Help me out. <P> There have been some very minor enhancements made. Some new textures and fogging effects have been added, and the engine seems to run a bit smoother. Ground textures have some filtering on them, for that nice angora sweater look, instead of the slight pixelization of the original. Texture popping is less of an issue than in the original, where I\'d watch mountain tops draw. But these are things for a patch, not a whole new game. The cockpit and view modes have not changed at all. <P> There have been some slight modifications made to the flight model in order to inch it closer in the direction of reality, but turns still feel off. I know we don\'t have the reports on the F-22 yet, so it\'s very difficult to comment on the way Raptor handles. Some drag and fuel consumption codes appear to have been added, and there is some speed bleeding. The fact is, we can\'t be certain about the flight model since the advanced design of the F-22 may indeed have many automatic and self-correcting features. But the physics of the world just don\'t feel convincing, and the avionics are certainly simplified. <P> The cockpit is set up in such a way that you cannot easily monitor instruments. The one pop-up screen offered is the attack/nav display, which only serves to highlight the failure of NovaLogic to create a convincing and useful information display. There isn\'t enough range or target information to make the display usable. Plus, it only offers the 90-degree forward-facing sensor arc, not the 360-degree defensive display, which is crucial to situational awareness. This means that you\'ll spend a lot of blind time glancing at instruments. I had a great deal of trouble tracking inbound missiles with these instruments. Either create a proper set of overlays (a la Navy Fighters), or keep the instruments visible in the cockpit view at all times. Like Interactive Magic, NovaLogic has also failed to include a moving map display. This means that if you suffer navigation systems failure, you can\'t finish a mission using VRF. Does the F-22 have an MMD? If it doesn\'t, the pilots at least have knee boards. An in-game map is essential. <P> On the plus side, there is some modeling of individual system failures. Enemy AI is vigorous, and wingman AI is improved over past NovaLogic titles. The graphics are sharp and smooth without 3Dfx, though they are not up to the current standard of hardware-only titles. The campaign is semidynamic, with some store tracking and a persistent battlefield (destroyed objects stay destroyed). Missions are still scripted, rather than dynamically generated. The five minicampaigns all run together, as you begin in Angola, then move on to Jordan, Russia, Columbia, and Iran. There is also a number of training and stand-alone missions. <P> Raptor is not done with a great deal of depth or complexity, but it is done in an entertaining and accessible way. The feel is most like US Navy Fighters, with a hop-in-and-take-care-of-business approach. Its ease of use and simple controls make it an ideal midrange sim for many. The debatable claims for hard-core realism aside, Raptor still suffers from a few problems, such as the avionics and map display issues. Furthermore, it feels like a rip-off. There is simply not enough that\'s new or different to justify a whole new game. This is the game owners of Lightning II deserved in the first place. <i>--T.

It is the only flight simulator with a completely real-time campaign, and it offers multiple levels of difficulty for novice and expert pilots alike.', ""Just when the Macintosh combat flight simulator market is growing stale, Falcon 4.0 flies onto the scene. Four years in the making, Falcon 4.0 sets a new standard for impressive visuals and realism. The graphics, physics, and multitude of functions achieve what the designers and developers set out to do: simulate an F-16. The premise of Falcon 4.0 is simple. Tensions in Korea have escalated to the point of war, and you're responsible for dispensing a healthy dose of justice. Your first task, though, is to master the controls of your F-16. Falcon 4.0's learning curve matches a 7G climb, and you're going to black out before you reach the end."", ""Thankfully, MacSoft ships several printed training guides, including a 400-page Flight Handbook, a map of Korea, and a chart of well over 100 keyboard commands. You'll greatly ap- preciate these references; it would be a nightmare to learn to fly the F-16 through PDF files."", ""The training manuals progressively expose you to all of the F-16's controls. The first section of the Flight Handbook is a companion to 31 simple tutorials. These missions begin with basic maneuvers and move on to all other aspects of the F-16. Lessons teach the functions of the interactive switches and dials in the cockpit and address the extensive radio system - you'll learn how to send commands to your wingman and how to find the nearest refueling tanker."", ""Falcon 4.0's graphics are a remarkable engineering feat. The terrain is a pleasing trade-off between photorealistic quality and designing the program to fit on one CD. Above 3,000 feet, the mountains and valleys are smooth. Close to the ground, square texture maps become visible, but they aren't distracting. The program also renders planes and other vehicles expertly. The hardware-accelerated graphics such as smoke trails, lens flares, and clouds are all gorgeous. The glass in the cockpit even reflects the surroundings, making it hard to grow tired of just looking around."", 'The physics in Falcon 4.0 round out the experience. The jets react very much in accordance with Newtonian physics. If you prefer arcade-style gameplay, you can trade realism for quick maneuverability and steer wherever you want without much concern for speed, weight, or gravity.', ""The game types in Falcon 4.0 are more diverse than in other flight sims. The options include Instant Action, Dogfight, and Campaign. Dogfight and Instant Action require little preparation - they place you in the middle of a fight. In the most planning-intensive mode, Campaign, you can select your missions, targets, and flight paths. You can also download missions other players have designed or create your own missions within the game. With all these different ways to play, it'll take hundreds of flights to even start to exhaust Falcon 4.0's possibilities."", ""The multiplayer features of Falcon 4.0 offer more variety than other simulators. For example, you aren't limited to dogfights in network play. Campaign mode is more fun with another player as your wingman or even as an enemy planning strikes against your base. However, the networking functions of Falcon 4.0 have some shortcomings. Internet battles work fairly well on a modem, but there's no simple way to find existing games. Another difficulty is that on LANs, Falcon 4.0 only supports TCP/IP connections, so AppleTalk users are out of luck."", ""Falcon 4.0 suffered from bugs in the earlier PC release, but fortunately the Mac version doesn't share these. Nevertheless, the porting company, Westlake Interactive, released a maintenance patch a few days after the game shipped. It's annoying to have to patch a shipping product, but in the games market, that's life. That said, the few bugs left after the update don't detract from gameplay."", ""As is common with cutting-edge games, the company understates Falcon 4.0's requirements. For the best performance, you need plenty of RAM, a G3, and a Rage 128 or Voodoo2 video card. In addition to high system requirements, Falcon 4.0 requires an InputSprocket-compatible joystick or flight stick. A true pilot wouldn't want to play with a mouse or keyboard."", ""Although Falcon 4.0 is merely a game, we like to think that it's the closest you'll get to climbing into an F-16 and flying the unfriendly skies at Mach speeds without becoming a real top gun. With its impressive visuals, realistic physics, and action-packed missions, Falcon 4.0 lets you engage MiGs, liberate nations, and win medals - and you can pause to take a breath once in a while. -- <i>Zack Stern</i>"", 'good news : Eye-candy overload.

Thankfully, there's a helpful map that lets you keep track of where all the mission objectives, enemies, and items are. This map is enhanced further by an onscreen compass that points you to items on the map, from armor pickups to enemy jeeps. Your chopper controls well with both the analog and digital controls, but the game doesn't actually feature any analog support. It would have been nice to execute slight turns and move ahead at half speed, but the game simply doesn't allow it. Jinking controls on the shoulder buttons and Z-trigger make it very easy to circle-strafe around any enemy. One of the many complaints with the PlayStation version was that it was nearly impossible to line up with any hostages or items close enough to winch them up. The N64 version has a helpful shadow that makes lining up the winch extremely easy. This alone makes the N64 version infinitely better than the PlayStation version. Nuclear Strike features pretty good sound, though most of it consists of simple weapons fire and explosions. There is, however, some speech in the game, which is usually played after you've completed an objective. This speech is well done. The game takes advantage of the expansion pak, letting you run in a higher resolution. The game only looks slightly more pixelated without the expansion, and it runs at a playable frame rate regardless. The varied mission design and fast action of Nuclear Strike make it a worthwhile shooter, even if the game it was based on is more than two years old. Some players may find that the enemies don't aim well enough, making the game a little too easy, but it's a fun experience regardless. Just start out playing it on the hard difficulty to ensure you get your money's worth.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

All of the wrestlers have the moves and abilities of their real-world counterparts. Once you have the perfect wrestler, you can battle in seven different game modes: Challenge, Career, King of the Ring, Versus, Tag Team, Cage Match, and Training. Are you tough enough to challenge all of the wrestlers in the WWF? Play WWF ATTITUDE and find out.', 'While WWF Attitude is one of the most anticipated games around on the console systems, everyone seemingly forgot that Acclaim was also doing a Game Boy Color (and only Game Boy Color - the game won\'t play on older GBs) version. However, that may very well be because this game is easily forgettable, offering little to no challenge and very little variance between its characters.  The game\'s high point has to be the modes, which range from your typical one-on-one contests and quests (including career mode and king-of-the-ring contests) to tag team matches and cage matches. There\'s also a training room, where you can practice strategy and test your moves against a dummy opponent, but the game is so simplistic that you needn\'t spend more than five to ten minutes getting a feel for the game.  While the game is extremely simple to pick up and master, it still manages to be a better game than most of Acclaim\'s previous WWF titles for the Game Boy, offering a wider selection of wrestlers and a much, much better graphical presentation. The game\'s also got most of the wrestlers\' finishing moves in there, though unlike the moves in the console versions of Attitude, here you just grapple your opponent and hit select and A at the same time. The game also really lacks any kind of pre- or post-match information. You\'re given a simple vs. screen before every match, and after every match in career mode you\'re spit back out to the ranking ladder, where your password is given. A simple ""Your winner is..."" screen really would have gone a long way here. Also, the game repeats the same music track endlessly throughout its title screens and matches. You\'ll definitely want to save some battery life (not to mention your ears) by turning the volume all the way down.  A link-cable multiplayer option really could have saved WWF Attitude. As a single-player game, it really doesn\'t offer much in the way of longevity. The AI is prone to far too many not-so-devious tricks and fails to put up a decent fight on even the hardest difficulty setting. It\'s better than the wrestling games to come before it, but it still doesn\'t quite get the job done. <i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The game tried to resurrect the Final Fight-style game by providing scads of bad guys you could beat by simply pounding on the punch button until everyone was dead. To put it bluntly, the first Fighting Force was not a good game. Fighting Force 2 takes the same basic beat-'em-up ethic and melds it with a pinch of Lara Croftian camera work and a smidgen of Metal Gear-esque espionage. The resulting game is better than the original, but it still comes off as an incredibly dull piece of software. The game sends you on several different missions, but your objective never really matters. You just plod through level after level, beating up anyone in your path and breaking all sorts of enemy equipment along the way. Just about anything you see can be destroyed if you hit it enough times. That's right, your character has the ability to make soda machines explode using only his bare fists. Heck, even an office chair will explode if you kick it hard enough. This is incredibly silly, especially when guns and health pickups start flying out of the copy machine you just stabbed with your knife. This is also just about the only cool element in the entire game. The enemies are painfully easy to defeat, especially given the copious amount of weapons you'll find along the way. Anything you can make explode could potentially contain another weapon for your inventory. Weapons include pistols (which our hero holds sideways like the true gangsta he is), a shotgun, knives, grenades, sledgehammers, pipes, and axes. The inventory is controlled by holding down a button and scrolling through your items until you find one you like - it's not a perfect scheme, but it works well enough. OK, the gameplay is weak and generic. The sound is occasionally sketchy. The controls are a little too touchy. But at least the game is fairly pleasing to the eye. Though there are occasionally some clipping problems and some bad seams here and there, the game generally looks pretty good. The textures are nice and crisp, and the animation is fluid. The behind-the-back camera works well, though it has lots of problems in small rooms. There's really nothing exciting about Fighting Force 2. The ease of gameplay makes it feel less like a game and more like an exercise. So you'll just wander around kicking everything in sight until sheer boredom forces you to turn the game off - which, depending on your tolerance level, will be anywhere from ten minutes to three hours. Yes, this game is better than the original Fighting Force - but that's really not saying much. Fighting Force 2 would make a decent rental, if only to laugh at the exploding office chairs, but not much else.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Cutthroats: Terror on the High Seas - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Sealed CD plus printed manual packaged in zip-lock bag. No box. Fast professional shipping.', 'Veteran gamers with fond memories of Sid Meier\'s Pirates! probably feel inclined to jump at every chance to lead a band of pirates on a ruthless quest for wealth and glory. But their high hopes will probably be dashed when they get their hands on this latest strategy game from the developers of Gangsters. While Cutthroats covers all the bases when it comes to the world of 17th-century piracy, in the end it feels more like an accounting class than a life of swashbuckling and freebooting. <P> You play as a pirate captain, starting with a single ship in the Caribbean between 1635 and 1700; the date you select determines how difficult the game will be. You get to read about the current events involving all the major seagoing powers of the time, but unfortunately this information is presented in the tiniest of print - a characteristic carried over from the manual, which is a Reader\'s Digest-sized book with a minuscule typeface. Straining to read the light-black type on a gray background is painful, and it takes over 150 pages (excluding history, designer notes, and glossary) to explain what\'s involved in being a successful pirate. Why all the wordage? Because Cutthroats\' interface - a mind-boggling array of icons on nearly every screen - isn\'t the least bit intuitive. <P> Before heading out on your first voyage, it\'s a good idea to head into town and recruit a few more crewmen, pick up a couple of extra cannons, and perhaps pay a visit to the governor to try to get on a good footing with him. Once that\'s done, it\'s time to set sail, but unfortunately what should be the most exciting part of any pirate game - attacking ships and pillaging towns - is where Cutthroats is least satisfying. <P> You can order the crewmen in the crow\'s nest to notify you when enemy ships approach, and when that happens, you can switch to an overhead view looking directly down on your ship. Once there, you\'ll eventually learn how many ships you\'ve encountered and, if you get close enough, what flags the ships are flying and what types of vessels they are. The problem is that there\'s no way to jump back to the strategic map immediately after you determine you don\'t want an encounter - only when the sighted ships get far enough away does that option become available. <P> The graphics for both sea- and land-based combat are laughably bad, like what you might expect from a Sega Genesis game from six years ago. What\'s more disappointing is the combat interface and ship behavior. You should be able to outrun and outmaneuver a ""battleship"" (a term that wasn\'t even used in the 17th century) with your sloop. But should an unfriendly ""battleship"" spot you, you can pretty much count on being hunted down - even if it takes 10 or 15 minutes of real time for the enemy to finally close and engage (why isn\'t there an ""accelerate time"" feature?). There\'s also no display of wind direction in the battle view, so the only way to determine wind direction is by steering until you find which way you\'re going the fastest. <P> Battles are drab and boring, but at least you\'ve got a nice variety of options: You can choose the type of shot (round, chain, grapeshot) or whether you want to fire muskets only, to grapple and board, or even ram your opponent. But these again are all represented with tiny icons called up by right mouse-clicks, and in the heat of battle you can easily get confused as you try to navigate and issue battle commands. At other times you\'ll see some truly strange happenings: Your ships might run aground and sink for no apparent reason, and hostile ships will get locked going round and round in circles. <P> Boarding enemy vessels ought to be a bloody affair, but in Cutthroats all you get for excitement is another miniature display of two guys about eight pixels tall fighting with swords, with numbers on the left and right showing how many men each side has left. Watching these events unfold is thoroughly boring, and the constant chatter of your commanders (""We\'ll send \'em to Davy Jones\' locker!"") doesn\'t help things one bit. There\'s no real reason to expect a complicated land-combat component when you\'ve got so few men to deal with, but there\'s also no excuse for the pathetic character graphics. <P> Cutthroats\' most interesting aspect is its economic model. After successful raids, you can head to friendly ports and exchange your booty for cash, then use your earnings to buy stuff for your crew (rum and food are high priorities), buy more ammunition, recruit new commanders and crewmen, bribe officials, and generally work the market. By exchanging information with ships you meet, you can find places where your cargo is in demand and make even more money. The interface for all this is on the complicated side, but once you get into it, it\'s actually pretty engrossing, and at least the graphics here are utilitarian if not actually impressive. <P> If you\'re into micromanagement and can stand simplified combat and poor graphics, Cutthroats should provide you with enough to keep you happy for a while. But if you\'re looking for a game that re-creates the drama and violence of 17th-century pirating, you won\'t find it here.<I>--Stephen Poole</I> <P> --<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Blood 2: The Chosen - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The original Blood won numerous fans, despite the fact that it was a 2D shooter released nearly a year after Quake made 3D environments standard. The clever level design and wisecracking antihero, Caleb, made up for the fact that the game was a technical throwback. Now, just over a year after the original hit stores, Monolith Productions has released a sequel. Based on Monolith\'s own LithTech engine, Blood II: The Chosen features some strong technical elements. The engine provides solid graphics (better than Quake II, not as good as Unreal), decent control, and great animation. But Blood II lacks some of the innovation of the original; the horror-theme is less pronounced, and the level design doesn\'t stray far from the average. <P> Blood II is excellent in several respects. Most of the weapons look and sound great, with the most notable example being the shotgun, which looks menacing and sounds even more so. The howitzer is also noteworthy, while the submachine gun looks bland, though it sounds good. On the low end of the spectrum is the Die Bug Die, a powerful insect repellent that neither looks nor sounds like it should be one of the more powerful weapons. There is a wide variety of weapons, and because you can only hold ten at a time, you must occasionally discard some. It\'s a nice feature, and one that lets you tailor your arsenal to your liking. <P> The animations are another high point in Blood II. Enemies move smoothly and look great. They die in a variety of ways, and you\'ll undoubtedly be struck the first time you see a human writhing on the ground after a grievous gut wound. On the downside, Blood II\'s artificial intelligence leaves something to be desired. Enemies usually won\'t attack until you come right into their line of sight and occasionally won\'t respond when attacked. The AI is better than in the first release of Shogo: Mobile Armor Division, Monolith\'s other LithTech-based shooter, but it\'s still nowhere near the level of Half-Life\'s believable enemy behavior. <P> Blood II looks impressive. The levels feature diverse appearances and spectacular colored lighting. The textures are great, and areas such as a tenement building and a museum are amazingly detailed. The levels themselves are diverse as well. In the first chapter alone, you\'ll travel from an ornate museum to a huge science facility to the alleys of an ominious city street to a futuristic flying machine. The game sounds just as good, with funny wisecracks, great ambient sounds, and an appropriately dark, techno soundtrack. <P> The major problem with Blood II is its pacing. Despite how good the levels look, they are at times confusing, with a variety of similar-looking corridors. Blood II uses a very traditional level design philosophy, and the need to find keys and push buttons is abundant. The designers are self-consciously aware of this, including jokes such as a mission briefing that tells you to push some buttons and kill some things, and a huge glowing sign advertising ""silver key industries."" Still, making jokes about it doesn\'t really help. Worse, you\'ll often go back through levels you\'ve already been through, arriving at any number of dead ends until you find the new path that has opened since your last visit. And while Blood II offers a variety of weapons and enemies, they are unevenly distributed, giving way to long stretches of the game in which you face the same group of monsters with the same group of weapons. <P> Blood II is by no means bad. In single-player, it is on par with Quake II, but lacking the innovation of Jedi Knight or Half-Life. Multiplayer with the LithTech engine still suffers from some of Shogo\'s latency problems, but the wide variety of weapons should make for some good deathmatching when Monolith gets those problems fixed. It\'s hard not to feel that Blood II is a step back in light of Half-Life; there\'s little sense of urgency, drama, or excitement. But it\'s hard to fault Blood II for not doing anything new; it sets out to be a traditional shooter and does a good, if not great, job. <i>--Ron Dulin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

PhotoDeluxe\'s interface looks more like a Web browser or a Macromedia Director interface than a Mac app. The program takes over your screen, adding its own background and putting up a series of buttons and tabs. These are designed to walk you through specific tasks (say, making a greeting card out of a family photo), instead of letting you work in a free-form environment with a bunch of tools and a palette. Adobe spent a lot of time analyzing what consumers want from digital photos and how they go about getting it. The company adjusted PhotoDeluxe to reflect what it learned. <P>The five buttons on the left side of the screen - Get Photo, Special Effects, Cards & More, Internet, and Send - appear in the order in which you most likely will need them. First get a photo, then touch it up, make something with it, and send it (either through the Internet or to the hard drive). Once you become accustomed to working in this fashion, the interface makes a lot of sense, but it\'s a tough transition for dyed-in-the-wool Adobe Photoshop users. Then again, PhotoDeluxe does not purport to replace Photoshop. <P>PhotoDeluxe 2.0 doesn\'t tie you to choosing between guided activities and free-form work, as PhotoDeluxe 1.0 did. Instead, clicking on a button brings up some tabs that contain tools arranged in a step-by-step order, without mandating that order. The addition of the Advanced button lets you access some of the more familiar (and potent) Photoshop tools. There is some serious power here - Adobe uses lots of Photoshop code in PhotoDeluxe. <P>PhotoDeluxe 2.0\'s great new features include red-eye removal; a Clone tool (for duplicating parts of an image); editable, rotatable, and sizable text; and several photo manipulation tools. These features, especially the Clone tool addition, make PhotoDeluxe 2.0 much richer than version 1.0. Of course, some other additions, such as image management, aren\'t so great. PhotoDeluxe uses the EasyPhoto Organizer, which catalogs files in galleries. The problem is that the gallery files included with PhotoDeluxe point to images on the PhotoDeluxe CD, so unless the CD is in the drive, the sample photos and clip art are not accessible. <P>Another downside, PhotoDeluxe takes up a lot of hard disk space. A minimal install occupies more than 70MB of space, and that does not include the photo galleries included with the program. Also, it takes some time to get used to opening and saving files using galleries. <P>PhotoDeluxe is not Photoshop. Repeat this mantra if you are a Photoshop user picking up PhotoDeluxe 2.0. It will be a frustrating experience. If, however, you\'re new to digital images and simply want to play around with pictures, PhotoDeluxe will suffice, especially for the $49 price tag. - David Reynolds <P> <B>Good News:</B> Easy photo manipulation. Includes Photoshop tools. Good step-by-step procedures. Great power for the price. <P><B>Bad News:</B> Interface is a real departure from the Mac standard.

Yoda Stories,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Game Boy Color', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Grab your lightsaber, young Jedi, and get ready for <i>Star Wars</i> adventuring in <i>Yoda Stories</i>. Assume the role of Luke Skywalker as he trains with Yoda to become a Jedi Knight. Harness the Force and travel across the galaxy to collect devices and weapons, and battle fearsome enemies. Yoda will guide you through 10 levels and many puzzle-based missions where you will meet exotic aliens, explore maps, and deal the Galactic Empire one crippling blow after another.', 'The annals of history are thick with lackluster Star Wars games. Although exceptional releases such as Dark Forces, Force Commander, and Jedi Knight serve as examples of positive gaming experiences, the majority of Star Wars titles better resemble the thud you hear when someone\'s on the receiving end of a Mike Tyson uppercut. Given this history, two possibilities exist for THQ\'s Game Boy Color release of Yoda Stories. It could either be a satisfying work of art or a festering pile of human waste. Approximately ten seconds into the game, the phrase ""work of art"" leaps to mind. Groovy caricatures of Yoda and Luke get the story off on the right foot, while initial glances at the top-down action-RPG levels give one the hope of a Zelda-like experience. Unfortunately, one second after providing Luke with forward momentum, the game\'s similarities to a dung heap become clear. Instead of animating smoothly, Luke progresses one square at a time, interacting with objects and enemies from eight possible directions. But Luke can only face in four directions! Because of this, pushing boxes or other objects is a chore, since Luke has a tendency to walk around anything he touches. Furthermore, battling Stormtroopers or sand people is nigh impossible, mostly due to the fact that they tend to circle around Luke as you wildly flail a poorly executed lightsabre. Yoda Stories is reminiscent of a Tiger LCD game, and each of its 15 levels plays just as bad, if not worse, than one of those $5 castaways. Though the storyline flows fairly well, getting through it is a major pain, as Luke\'s entire mission is to wander hinter and yon, gathering objects that can be traded for more objects, all in an effort to act out various aspects of the Star Wars myth. Repetition is quick to set in, enemies are lacking in variety, and about the only bright spot to the gameplay is that the difficulty level is low. As if the poor control and lackluster gameplay weren\'t enough, the game delivers a visual experience akin to that of a Viewmaster toy. In fact, it\'s quite possible that a Viewmaster could deliver better animation and visuals than Yoda Stories. Though still images give the impression that the game will look decent, the truth is that the lack of colors, the animation, and the severe sprite repetition serve as an all-out affront to one\'s senses. Luke animates with only two or three frames per movement, nonplayer characters with even less, and backgrounds are as stagnant as Mexican well water. Speaking of backgrounds, though the game offers a plethora of locations, each one is rendered from a minimal stock of four templates. Admittedly, they\'re drawn acceptably, but one or two screen\'s worth of locales, and you\'ll be begging to be put down from constant feelings of deja vu. There aren\'t even any cutscenes to reward the diligent player who completes each level. Even Nintendo\'s Game &amp; Watch series, which Yoda Stories resembles, has cutscenes and picture galleries! Further deepening the torture, the game\'s audio simply begs to be silenced. Weapon and interaction sounds are decent, but the major lack of variety quickly makes them an unwelcome occurrence. Similarly, the game\'s background music is appropriate, but since a new one doesn\'t kick in until you reach a later level, gut-wrenching repetition sets in quickly. You can only listen to the first 20 seconds of the Star Wars theme just so much. It\'s an understatement to say that not since Kickle Cubicle has sound in a video game been so blah and uninspiring. Sadly, there is no reason for anyone to play through Yoda Stories. The storyline is one that Star Wars fans already know; the gameplay is below that of Quest for Camelot; and better graphics and sound exist in 20-year-old Colecovision games. Furthermore, the game\'s password save system requires you to reach the end of a level before it offers you the ability to rejoin the quest, almost forcing a person to play the game. If THQ, Torus, and Lucasfilm are lucky, people will forget this stinker quickly. Yoda Stories is quite possibly the worst Star Wars video game ever produced.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Mission Impossible,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['PlayStation ~ Mission Impossible', ""The PlayStation version is a direct port of last year's N64 game with minor improvements, such as dramatic lighting effects, speech, and a quick-save feature. While these enhancements certainly make the game better than its N64 counterpart, M:I simply wasn't that great to begin with and it now feels dated in comparison to more recent spy games such as Syphon Filter, Metal Gear Solid, or even Tomorrow Never Dies. The storyline of the game loosely follows that of the original movie. A mole has infiltrated the IMF team and framed you, agent Ethan Hunt. Now you must recover the NOC list (a document that lists all the IMF operatives working undercover around the world) to lure the mole into the open so he can clear his name. To do so, you'll visit various locations that you'll recognize from the movie such as the CIA headquarters in Langley VA, where Tom Cruise hung from a rope to access the world's most secure computer. You get to do this and many other things seen in the movie, as well as embark on completely new missions. Some are fun and challenging, such as the one where you get to use a sniper rifle to take out the bad guys as they try to attack one of your team members. But levels like these are few and far between, and the majority are just plain boring.  The missions are basically broken up into two parts. One portion will have you running around the level collecting and using objects while avoiding enemy detection. The later parts are straightforward action levels where you have to do things like shoot all the bad guys you come across, jump over dangerous toxic goo, and blow up targets. For instance, on the embassy-party level, you must assume the identity of a specific guest. You have to knock him out first, but you can't just walk up and smack him or it will blow your cover. So you have to lure him away by putting nausea powder in his drink, forcing him to run to the restroom where you can knock him out unseen and then use your face maker to assume his identity. Once you've taken his appearance, making it past the guards is a breeze. There are other instances where the interaction between your character and the characters in the game is subtle but smart. For example, when you are in a place where a gun would be inappropriate, like a hospital, the characters in the hospital start screaming that you have a gun, thus causing a big stir, and security is dispatched to come and pick you up.  The visuals and camera angles in Mission Impossible are competent. All of the action is seen from a camera angle behind and above Ethan when you're in open areas. When you're in close quarters, the camera angle changes to a behind-the-back view, and if you need to see something or use the targeting crosshairs to place a careful shot, you can hit your gun button that makes Ethan transparent, letting you see through him. It's hard to miss with the Mission: Impossible theme and accompanying spy tunes, so the soundtrack is good, but the sound effects are only fair. Some sounds are quite familiar and surely have appeared in other games. The inclusion of speech in the PlayStation version of Mission Impossible is a definite plus, although more because it saves you the pain of reading lengthy text bits (as was the case in the original version) than because of its quality of acting. The accents the actors use for the Russian characters in the game are downright comical. One really helpful tool that has been added to the PlayStation version of Mission Impossible is its quick-save feature, which lets you save your progress in a level at any point without the need of a memory card. This makes the game so much easier, because you can start from where you last saved in a level so you don't have to start the whole mission over again. It trims down on a lot of frustration. Overall, Mission Impossible for the PlayStation isn't a bad game, and it's certainly better than its N64 counterpart, but compared with more recent spy games for the PlayStation, it just doesn't stand up. Even if you really enjoy the genre and have already played Syphon Filter, Metal Gear Solid, and Tomorrow Never Dies, you should still consider renting Mission Impossible before buying.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

Croc 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['This game introduces Croc as a crusading crocodile who must rescue his friends, the Gobbos, from the evil villain Baron Dante. Baron Dante has taken over the Gobbo Valley and is turning all good creatures to evil with his magical powers. With amazing graphics and animation, including moves such as swimming, swinging, and flying, you can explore with Croc in more than 250 individual game areas on 45 levels.', ""Originally released for the PlayStation, Croc 2 is the sequel to a generally forgettable 3D platform game from 1997. As could be expected, the developers at Argonaut have improved virtually every aspect of the original Croc for the sequel: The levels are larger, many new subgames have been included, and the visuals are more complex and colorful. Unfortunately, as was the case when the original Croc was released, similar games such as Spyro the Dragon 2 and Rayman 2 have already set the current standard for excellence in the genre. And in comparison with those games, Croc 2 is a competently executed but uninspired also-ran. <P> Croc 2 adheres to the 3D platform structure introduced by Super Mario 64. You guide a cute character through a series of connected hub worlds, each containing a number of areas and tasks that must be completed to advance to the next world. Each level contains optional items that can be collected to unlock secret areas and power-ups. To accomplish these goals, Croc can jump, butt-stomp, swim, climb, and ride various vehicles such as the old genre standby, the mine cart, and six others, including a giant snowball. <P> In the absence of any great innovation, Croc 2 needs to get by on its production values. The graphics and sound are good but not especially memorable. Croc 2 is 3D accelerated and supports all the latest visual gewgaws such as transparencies and lighting effects. Aside from some glaringly misaligned textures, there's really nothing to complain about. The design is adequate to convey an air of generic cartoon whimsy yet never really makes the game come to life in any kind of satisfying or surprising way. From the lava world to the ice world, you've seen all of Croc 2's sights many times before in other games. <P> Thanks to awkward controls, traversing Croc 2's unimaginatively eccentric environments is more trouble than it should be. Two different control schemes are available, but neither one is particularly successful. The first method lets you move Croc forward and backward and rotate him left and right by pressing the respective direction on the keyboard or joystick. Unless you tap quickly, the right and left turns end in a step forward, which can be disastrous in a tight situation or while attempting to line up a precise jump. The second method simply lets you turn and move Croc toward whatever direction you press. In this mode, there's no backpedaling. You have to press a separate key to do a 180-degree turn. Both control schemes are overly sensitive and take a long and often frustrating amount of time to master. Some of the early levels have timed tasks, and trying to learn the controls under the pressure of a time limit is often more maddening than fun. <P> Croc 2's developer, Argonaut Software, hasn't solved the camera problems that plague this type of game. The camera is often set too close to the main character and isn't always pointed at an angle suited to moving Croc from one place to another. At some points in the game, generally whenever you're forced to make precise jumps in a tight corridor, it's almost impossible to complete the maneuvers without missing. The camera also lags behind you when you turn, which makes it overly difficult to quickly perform a sequence of jumps at right angles to each other. The game supports a free-look in the form of a pair of binoculars. Oddly, while it overlays a binocular cutout on the screen, nothing is actually magnified. Instead, there's simply less visible area, and you can only focus in a 180-degree arc around Croc. A more standard free-look would have been a better idea. <P> Croc 2 does include one unique option called omniplay, which lets you split the controls between two joysticks. For instance, one person can control the camera and jumping while another controls everything else. It's a good way to share the game experience with kids. <P> By the halfway point of Croc 2, you'll have learned to tolerate the controls, circumvent the camera, and make Croc do your bidding, more or less. The entire package is blandly professional enough and provides enough consistent gameplay to avoid outright dismissal, but it clearly lacks the imaginative spark necessary to make playing it a memorable experience. <BR>--<I>Erik Wolpaw</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc.

There are 10 scenes or levels to get Buzz through, each with its own obstacles and power sources. Although the game play essentially comes down to the relatively brainless activity of trying to earn points by flying through coins, batteries and air blasts, there\'s also a fair amount of novelty built in. In one scene, Buzz rides Bullseye the Horse to hop aboard a plane. In another scene, Buzz goes up an elevator to get to Al\'s apartment. You won\'t find any violence or worrisome content- Buzz only uses his laser gun to slow down Rex and other critters- and while testers struggled at times, on the whole, they were enthusiastic.<br /><b>Teaches: </b>game play, logic <br /><b>Age Range: </b>5-up Copyright  2000 Children\'s Software Revue -- <i><a href=""https://secure.tradenet.net/childrenssoftware/csroffer.html"">From Children\'s Software Revue -- ""Subscribe Now!""</a></i><br /><br />Toy Story 2 follows the film of the same name. After Woody is kidnapped by a greedy toy collector, Buzz Lightyear and his friends set out to rescue him in a side-scrolling platformer that takes them from Andy\'s bedroom to Al\'s apartment to an airport and back to home sweet home. Because Woody is incapacitated during most of the movie (and in the game), Buzz Lightyear has to do all the work. You can only control Buzz - but that\'s not necessarily a bad thing, given that he can shoot lasers out of his wrists and ""fall with style."" The gameplay is pretty simplistic, with Buzz running and jumping from left to right and climbing beds, bookshelves, airport chairs, and the like while collecting keys, batteries, and power-ups as he races across town to rescue Woody. Like in the Pixar film, Buzz is extremely well drawn: His jumping and climbing animations are very fluid and smooth. Many of the other toys in the game weren\'t given the same care, as they simply walk back and forth relentlessly, waiting for a zap from your laser to put them out of their misery. The background graphics (consisting mostly of posters and other toy memorabilia) occasionally blend too well with the foreground graphics, leading you to wonder if they can be interacted with. The sound and music are standard Game Boy fare: nothing fancy, but nothing wrong either. Where the game suffers is in its control scheme. If the designers had done their homework and played the original Super Mario Bros. game they would have realized that it\'s never a good idea to make the jump button the same as the run button. When B is tapped Buzz jumps; when it is held down, he runs; when it\'s held down without the directional cross he jumps repeatedly. This leads to stuttering animations when you\'re trying to negotiate tight platforms, and it forbids any Mario-esque long-distance hurdles that require timing and technique.

Released in this inopportune era, Test Drive 6 will have a hard time competing, especially given Gran Turismo 2\'s looming shadow. TD6 does offer a host of features, including the requisite single-player mode, tournament-style races, and extras such as cop chases, but, in the end, there are many other titles that offer similar modes, executed much more successfully.  TD6\'s single-player mode belies the illusion of depth. While the arcade-style gameplay lets you easily become a competent driver, it undermines the game\'s more ""serious"" customization/simulation aspects. The analog controls are the only way to go with this one game, the left stick functioning to steer, the right to accelerate and to brake. The intuitive nature of this scheme multiplies the ""arcade"" feel a thousandfold, making turns at obscene speeds amusingly easy. During powerslides, very little speed is compromised, making it relatively simple to speed through even the most convoluted courses.  The single-player mode is broken down into single races, tournament races, challenges, and cop chases. The single and tournament races pit racers against five other cars in their class, of which there are four. To advance up the automotive food chain, you must win races to score enough cash to buy rides in a higher class. Before each single and tournament race, you must put cash down in a pot, which each computer racer will match; the three drivers in the winner\'s circle divvy upthe sum, each share relative to the order they placed. The challenges have you race through a predetermined course, and rewards are earned if the race is completed  withina set time. The challenges can be played again and again, with the reward being paid each time the previous record is broken.  The single-player cop chases are harshly limited; you can only play as the cop, whose job it is to hound around the racecourses and bust the racers to get ticket money. Cash earned by ticketing is transferred to your account, where it can be used to purchase new vehicles or upgrade existing ones. The actual courses consist of either standard autocross or closed-circuit racing. Obstacles are littered around the cityscapes, and mundane traffic is your worst enemy. Race into the opposite lane under an overpass, and you\'ll run into a veritable wall of oncoming traffic; stay in the proper lane, and you\'ll be gridlocked by Sunday drivers. It\'s relatively easy to maneuver around bystanders most of the time, but, especially at intersections, things can get pretty cramped. The AI for the civvy cars seems rather haphazardly scripted. You will often see them ramming into each other at intersections or stuck in the middle of the road, idling next to some obstacle. The cops also rampage throughout the courses. Throughout many courses, police units will put forth a halfhearted attempt at impeding your progress by standing in the way of a busy thoroughfare - lights flashing and sirens blaring. Many courses also feature semibranching  paths and shortcuts, which let you gain a quick edge on the other racers, if used well.  As far as graphics go, TD6 is merely adequate. Most of the vehicles effectively resemble their physical counterparts, but few effects are used that\'ll make you look twice. The frame rate is passable, except during busy thoroughfares and intersections, where things get a mite choppy. The textures used are rather bland and muted, nothing positive or negative to chime about. The lighting effects used during night courses seem almost like an afterthought, as they appear to integrate poorly with the rest of the environment.  Infogrames has apparently decided to go with the ""street cred soundtrack for a car game"" convention, including cuts from artists like q-burns abstract message, Eve 6, and Lunatic Calm. Fear Factory\'s cover of Cars borders on blasphemous. The tracks are looped during play, making some of them get old faster than they should.  In the end, TD6 should be treated as a light snack. With Gran Turismo 2 on the horizon, it\'s daft to invest in any other racing game in the near future. TD6\'s mock-serious approach to arcade-style racing should warrant nothing more than a rental; to humor its illusion of depth would mean a sizable investment of time for a truly shallow return.<i>--Miguel Lopez</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

Ballistic: Playstation 1,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Puzzle Players Unite! Ballistic is the exciting new action puzzle game everyone\'s been talking about! It\'s simple to play and offers endless hours of fun. Your goal is to keep the balls from reaching the center gate. rotate the launcher and shoot the balls into a constantly growing sting of balls. Matching three-of-a-kind creates a ""chain reaction"" and makes them disappear. Combine multiple chains for even more points! From Gamefaqs.com', ""The puzzle game is truly a unique genre. To make a good puzzle game you don't necessarily need all the elements other games need. A good puzzle game may not require amazing graphics or sound, as long as the basic idea that drives the puzzle is a good one. Ballistic is a perfect example of this truth, with an original and interesting puzzle mechanic resting behind overly simple graphics and music. It's easy to tell that Ballistic was probably inspired by Bust-A-Move, as the gameplay revolves around you shooting variously colored balls at other balls of the same color to eliminate them from the puzzle. Where the game differs is in the actual presentation. Instead of just being in a standard puzzle-gaming pit, your cannon sits at the center of a spiral, with a series of balls slowly moving toward you. Once the balls reach the center of the spiral, they blow up your turret, and your game is over. As in most puzzle games, the key to preventing your doom is to start long chains and therefore eliminate large numbers of balls at once. You'll also get the help of various power-ups, such as the bomb piece (which eliminates one color of balls completely) and the snail piece (which slows down the rate that the string moves toward the center). But there are also things to deter you, such as covered parts of the spiral that inhibit shots, as well as tornadoes that deflect balls. There are two modes you can choose from - the stage mode and the panic mode. Panic mode puts you up against an unlimited string of balls with a meter that increases the level of difficulty as you progress. The stage mode puts you up against a limited string in different stages. Some stages have power-ups, some have variously shaped spirals, and some even have two different spirals, each with a separate string. If you'd like some competitive challenge, you can play in the two-player mode or even in the link mode. The two-player is a simplified version of the panic mode - the game ends when one player loses. To call the graphics simple would be an understatement. There aren't a lot of objects in this game, and about the only thing that changes are the colors of the balls and the backgrounds. Aside from that, get used to seeing the turret, the spiral, and a whole lot of colored spheres. The various items you'll encounter are all in the form of self-explanatory icons. The clock briefly halts the spiral, and the treasure chests contain power-ups. The sound is pretty bad. The effects are really simple - a slight shooting noise when you shoot a ball and a breaking noise when you eliminate a series. One of the cooler effects is a sound similar to a rotary phone whirring when you make two separate parts of the spiral backtrack into each other. The music is all the same - cheesy elevator tunes that get crazy and hectic when the spiral gets close to the center. Unfortunately, once you reach the spot where the string is on the edge of being too close to the center of the spiral, the soundtrack will switch back and forth between the normal music and the excited music as you eliminate sets. This gets extremely annoying and makes the temptation to turn off the music very great. Playing the game is about as simple as it gets. Move the controller up and down to aim the cannon then hit any of the four buttons to shoot a ball. The cannon has a cool dotted line to help you align your aim, as a miss will plant another ball in your string. Such simplistic control really lends itself to the gameplay, making it a game anyone can pick up and start playing. However, the game's interface is also extremely simplistic, making it almost tedious. After you end any of the modes you'll have to go back to the press-start screen and then proceed back to the mode you want. An interfacethat was more user-friendly could have helped this game a whole lot. Despite the simplistic nature of the game and sheer mediocrity of many of the game elements, Ballistic is still a fairly fun puzzle game with a refreshingly new premise. While the gameplay may get a little boring at times, it's still fairly solid, and it lends itself well to people who aren't necessarily fans of the puzzle genre.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

For a lesser challenge, you can play against 64 imaginary players, all with their own imaginary play styles, imaginary biographies, imaginary ratings, and imaginary mug shots. Any single-player chess game is only as good as its AI, and fortunately, Chessmaster II's is solid. While I thought I was an exceptional chess player, this game showed me that I wasn't nearly as good as I had once believed. <P>Chessmaster focuses on making you a better chess player. It comes with more than ten FMVs that explain strategy - from each piece and its significance, to complex moves such as castling or en passant. In addition to this, there's on-the-fly strategy, giving you advice on how to respond to scenarios. The game is filled with actual attacking and defending strategies, so you can know exactly how to operate a Queen's Gambit or run a King's Indian Attack.  <P>The graphics are nice enough. If you don't like the way things look you can change the graphical details, from board color to set type. The game has more than fifteen different chess sets, most of which are 3D. Unfortunately, some of them are difficult to make out, and overall the graphics have a really grainy look to them. You can also change the angle of the board if things get confusing. The soundtrack reminded me of listening to the new-age channel on cable radio, as it's filled with nonintrusive instrumentals that could be described as uplifting. If you're not partial to your track, you can change it. And while the God-like voice calls the move, I wished it would also tell you when a known strategy was being played, instead of just listing it in text. <P>Chess is a game best played against a live opponent. It's doubtful that a computer will ever be able to simulate all the nuances of playing against a living, breathing being. However, if you can't find anyone to play or you wish to practice, Chessmaster is definitely a viable substitute. With tons of customization options and a system that focuses on learning, Chessmaster is the clear choice for people who wish to experience chess on their PlayStation. --Ben Stahl <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Urban Chaos,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""In the closing days of 1999, a rampant crime wave has come to grip Union  City. As either streetwise rookie cop D'arci Stern or vigilante Roper McIntyre,  you must counteract the crazed millennium cult that wishes to fulfill  Nostradamus's prediction for Armageddon. To defeat the cult, you'll have to  complete 30 missions--but how you complete those missions is up to you. There  are numerous ways to complete your goal through all of the levels."", 'In <i>Urban  Chaos</i>, you\'ll utilize a variety of gaming experiences to complete these  missions. Your character can ride the subway, commandeer taxis, and even jump  between rooftops. In your effort to uncover the truth, you can also use  aggressive tactics to pry suspects for information. The soundtrack to this  third-person crime fighter is provided, featuring electronica recording stars  Photek and Asian Dub Foundation, among others. <i>Urban Chaos</i> supports the  separately sold <a href=""exec/obidos/ASIN/B00002DHEU/${0}"">memory card</a>, so  you won\'t have to save all of Union City at one sitting.', 'Urban Chaos started life on the PC, as an ambitious action game that really brought something new to the Final Fight-esque beat-\'em-up genre - mostly by tossing in a behind-the-back camera and giving the game more of a free-roaming attitude than a ""go here, beat this guy up"" mentality. But while the game worked very well on the PC - a platform devoid of all things punching and kicking - whoever was in charge of the PlayStation version forgot to port the fun over to the Sony console. Urban Chaos takes place in Union City. You, as D\'arci Stern, rookie cop, must first work through a few training missions, which detail things like how to fight and how to control a vehicle. Then it\'s off to the city streets. In each level, you\'re given a few main objectives to accomplish. In one, you must arrest at least one mugger and return an abandoned vehicle to the station. In another, you have to find a way to get a suicidal man down from a building (and no, pushing him off isn\'t a valid way). Secondary, optional objectives will occasionally pop up as well, asking you to find a stolen police car or find a murderer. From a premise and design standpoint, Urban Chaos sounds like a winner. But there are many, many factors working against the game. For starters, the graphics are horrible. The character models are incredibly blocky, almost every texture in the game is ugly and warped, and the draw-in distance is about 25 feet in front of you, ensuring that you\'ll never be able to get a clear view of any action until you\'re right on top of it. The sound is decent. The game features lots of speech that typically works well. The control is decent, though it may be a bit too loose for some players to get a handle on, and the fighting could have been handled much better. Also, the game tries to use action-specific music. Normally, the game is silent, except for the sounds of the streets. But when you start running, a little loop starts playing. It\'s a nice concept - too bad the loop is almost too short to count as actual music and gets annoying after only a few seconds. The PC version of Urban Chaos really had a lot going for it, and at its core, it was already a very console-style game. However, Eidos simply chose the wrong console, as the PlayStation version of Urban Chaos is ugly and almost completely unplayable. If you\'ve got a PC capable of playing the original version, check it out, and try to forget that the PlayStation version even exists.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

Demolition Racer,,['1 or 2 Players'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>Demolition Racer</i> is the perfect antidote for ""civilized""  racing games. If shaving seconds off your lap times in games like  <i>Gran Turismo 2</i> is just too darn frustrating, then <i>Demolition  Racer</i> serves up a heaping helping of catharsis. The object of this  game is not only to win the race, but to destroy the other racecars on  the way to victory.', ""Unlike the weapons-oriented auto combat games, such as <i>Vigilante  8</i> and <i>Twisted Metal</i>, your only weapon here is that physics  formula you learned in high school: force equals mass times  acceleration. And what a wonderfully practical application of that  formula <i>Demolition Racer</i> provides. Being the first at the finish  line doesn't guarantee a win, because the final score comes from a  formula that multiplies your race ranking with damage points that are  inflicted on other cars. And the crashes don't seem canned: cars twist,  roll, and spin, catching fire here and losing panels there."", ""The sheer irresponsibility of the game makes it exciting at first.  After more play, players will appreciate the track design, the car  physics, the paint shop, and the seemingly endless variety of gameplay  modes. If you've grown tired of racing games, <i>Demolition Racer</i>  is just what the doctor ordered. <i>--Jeff Young</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b>', '<b>Cons:</b>', '', ""I've been a fan of demolition derbies since I was a small child. Let's face it: Watching cars crash into each other is just plain fun, and it really seems like a natural topic for a video game. While several games have claimed to be destruction-derby games, they're really just racing games with a different scoring model and visible car damage."", ""Games like Destruction Derby and Destruction Derby 2 placed far too much emphasis on causing the opposing cars to spin. It was the only real way to score any points, and it pretty much sucked the fun out of the game. Head-on collisions just damaged your car way too much and had little or no payoff. So you aimed for the fenders of the other cars. Demolition Racer uses a slightly more realistic scoring system. So you'll earn points for most collisions, as well as specialty scores for setting a car on fire, knocking a car out of the race, and landing on other cars. However, the scoring detection is a bit off. You really need to make hits with the front (or back, if you're going in reverse) of your car. Controlled fishtails that smack your opponents with the rear fender of your car are worthless. Also, the game seems to miss a lot of hits, especially in multicar pileups, robbing you of potential points. Your car's damage is rendered on a simple meter that goes from 100 down to zero. While certain hits may do more damage to your vehicle, area-specific damage doesn't really occur."", ""Much like its brethren, Demolition Racer is broken up into two main types of events. You'll find the meat of the game on actual racetracks, where you'll battle it out for three laps against fifteen other cars. Winning these races requires a delicate balance of speed and brutality. You must damage other cars to score, but you must also finish near the top of the pack, because the earlier you finish, the greater your score is multiplied. The other races are arena battles, which are won solely on how much damage you can cause to the rest of the cars. There are a few variants on these two basic race types - such as chicken mode, the chase, and suicide."", 'The control in Demolition Racer is smoother and cleaner than that of previous derby games. The Dual Shock controller works extremely well here - with the left stick used for steering and the right for accelerating and braking. Since the car only has two real options (forward and reverse), this is one of the few instances where using the right stick for both gas and brake works really well.', ""Graphically, Demolition Racer does a lot of things right. It's got a very smooth frame rate, and the car models look nice, take damage well, and have lots of nice fire and smoke effects. But all this graphical sheen comes at a cost. Because of clipping problems on a couple levels, you'll see cars and sections of track through walls. A wider camera option would have been nice in the arena levels, since when you take shots from the side, you're frequently just bouncing around without seeing what is actually hitting you. Bands like Fear Factory and Cirrus populate the soundtrack, and the game does a decent job of providing collision and engine noises."", ""If you've played Destruction Derby, you've played Demolition Racer. While DR is a better game, it would have been nice to see a more realistic scoring system that took things like radiator shots and driver's side-door hits (a big no-no in real derbies) into account. It's a solid, fun game, but it lacks any real originality. --Jeff Gerstmann <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Fighter Maker,,['PS1'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""There have been countless fighting games over the years, some technical, some fantastic, but none have ever offered you the option to create your own moves. With Fighter Maker, you're put into the developer's seat and given complete control over how your character fights. While, in concept, this is a novel idea, Fighter Maker struggles with serious design flaws that prevent the game from reaching its potential. <P>Fighter Maker could be described as having two different parts. There's the fighting aspect of the game and the design aspect of the game. Those of you who don't want to deal with the tedious character creation process can simply jump into the horribly bland fighting game, at least for the entire six levels that it offers before you've beaten the game. There are no hidden characters, no end boss, and you only fight a fraction of your available characters before the game is over. The edit mode lets you tweak every aspect of your fighter, such as stance, attacks, victory dance, and throws. Once you've tweaked your character to your liking, you can try the moves out in a test session. If that works out well for you, you can set the logic behind the character; in other words, you can determine how a computer-controlled version of your character will react, percentage-wise, in response to his opponent's current activity. <P>The edit mode suffers from some serious problems, turning a seemingly simple control scheme into a nightmare. It creates motions with a series of frames, all of which you must edit one by one. While you're editing a frame, you can move each joint of your character's body on three different axes. Unfortunately, once you've moved a body part, it turns into an overly simple wire-frame version, which makes it all too easy to lose track of exactly which direction the body part actually faces. Accidentally making your character's head face the wrong way or the backs of their knees point forward only adds to the frustration. In addition, you can only copy and paste one frame at a time instead of being able to copy or move a series of frames. This makes character turnarounds or running throws almost not worth creating. Throws are especially time consuming, as you must edit not only your character's movements, but your opponent's as well. Unfortunately, both bodies don't appear on the edit screen at the same time, so you must constantly switch back and forth to ensure that everything lines up between characters. Also, while you are at liberty to create fantastic, unreal attacks, you can't create projectile attacks. <P>The phonebook-sized manual is bland and too vague in all the essential areas. It boasts that creating a move is as simple as making a beginning frame and an end frame, and that the game will generate all the in-between. While this is for the most part true, the computer isn't exactly good at filling in the missing frames, and as such, all the motions created this way end up looking unnatural, and in some cases, they look completely impossible. So you're forced to spend a tiring amount of time generating all the frames essential to creating your move. And once it's done - I assure you - it won't look as good as you'd hoped. <P>The graphics are plain and unappealing. Aside from Skullomania of Street Fighter EX fame, or a character that looks very much like Starman from Pro Wrestling on the NES, the characters look generic and are without any real personality. What's worse is that you're forced to choose from the unexciting premade cast, instead of creating a fully custom look to your character. Not much can be said for the backgrounds, as they're mostly barren, plain, and unimaginative. The character-select screen is boring, the loading screen is pitifully lame, and the menu selection screens follow suit. Fighter Maker becomes a better game when you put it on mute. The sound is humdrum - you hear music only during fighting sequences, while the sound offers an annoying frequency of cheesy effects. <P>Neither mode is good enough to stand on its own. The edit mode is confusing, frustrating, and in the end, self-defeating, while the fighting mode is lackluster, boring, and laughably short. The game comes with a distinct fighting style for each fighter, which can be loaded from the CD and modified in the edit mode. Most of the moves are lifted directly from one of the Tekken games, with a few pleasant exceptions. The ironic part is that there are so many moves already in the game that unless you know some exotic fighting style or have a crazy imagination, the move you'd want to create is already included in the game in some form. <P>Surely developers don't create fighting games using a PlayStation controller, and Fighter Maker successfully drives that point home. The joy achieved from creating a nice-looking kick is short lived once you realize the countless hours of mundane tweaking you spent creating it. And while the ability to create tailored movements is certainly appealing, in application it's exceedingly difficult and is sure to frustrate you to the point that you'll never want to toy with the edit mode again. And, once you've lost the desire to tweak your character, the below-average fighting mode certainly won't keep you playing. --Ben Stahl <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Railroad Tycoon II,,['System Requirements: An IBM PC or compatible Pentium 133 MHz (or faster) with: 16 MB RAM; a 4x CD-ROM drive; 220 MB free hard drive space; a DirectX compatible video card; and Windows 95 / 98 / ME.'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""More than just some Lionel train spinning around inside your TV, <I>Railroad Tycoon 2</I> is an accurate simulation of the history and ruthless capitalism of the railroad industry. Play as one of more than 40 magnates in 18 realistic campaigns that take place between the dawn of the locomotive and tomorrow's sleek bullet trains. You'll buy land, lay track, hire managers, and, most of all, keep your trains on time. Keep an eye on the region's economy, or your competition may just come and eat your lunch."", ""Railroad Tycoon II gives you the responsibility of running your own railroad and charges you with the task of turning a tiny company into a powerful empire. Although it is a somewhat simplified version of its PC brother, the objective of the PlayStation version can be just as daunting. Not only must you worry about laying track, managing stations, hauling cargo, and keeping your trains running, but you must also keep an eye on the stock market and maintain the country's economy. All of this translates into one immersive experience, as Railroad Tycoon II successfully re-creates the burdened feeling the owners of actual railroads must have felt. There are three game modes - a campaign mode, which places you in a preset scenario and gives you certain objectives to complete within an established time limit; a scenario mode, which lets you pick a map, a date, and a difficulty level then simply lets you build a railroad; and a sandbox mode, where you're given an unlimited supply of resources so you can build the railroad of your dreams without having to worry about profits or reality. But the true flexibility of Railroad Tycoon II comes with the different configurations for each mode - the campaign mode lets you decide what advantage your company starts with, and the scenario mode lets you set several different variables - from profit multiplier, to economic model, to AI difficulty. In addition, while the towns and landmasses of the maps never change, different plants and town demands are randomized in the scenario mode, keeping you from playing the same game twice.  Unfortunately, Railroad Tycoon II doesn't let you save in the middle of your game - the save function is missing from the scenario game, and the campaign mode only saves information on the campaigns you've completed. This makes truly getting into Railroad Tycoon II a time-consuming process, as you must set aside plenty of time to play or risk leaving your PlayStation on for extended periods of time. Most of the game progresses in the actual map window - this is where you can see your railroad's layout and watch your trains move from one station to the next. Lining the sides of the map window are different submenus, where you can manage other areas of your railroad - from purchasing trains, to assigning routes and cargo, to upgrading stations and playing with the stock market. All of these screens have buttons that lead into each other, making moving through screens and managing several different aspects quick and easy. Once you've made your run through the different menus you can return to the map window to watch your empire grow. While the PlayStation's controller usually doesn't lend itself to a game so dependent on a cursor, Railroad Tycoon II overcomes this problem by making great use of the analog control. You use the analog function to move the cursor exactly as a mouse would, while the D-pad is used to quickly move between different options. In addition, Railroad Tycoon II is full of controller shortcuts. You can move between options with lightning speed once you're used to the shortcuts. All of this makes Railroad Tycoon II's detailed menu system extremely bearable. Railroad Tycoon II takes place in actual global locations, including the British Isles, Korea, and the Midwestern United States. Each map is realistically detailed, giving Railroad Tycoon II a refreshingly realistic feel to it. In addition, inventions and scientific progress happen according to real-life dates. New engines are introduced into the game in exactly the same year they were in real history, events occur on their actual dates, and managers who apply to your railroad are actual historic figures, each with advantages and disadvantages that are based on that person's historic accomplishments.  While graphics may not be all that important in a game like this, Railroad Tycoon II still sports some fairly nice ones. The various buildings and plants have their own distinctive look, and once you learn which building produces what, it's easy to tell what cargo should go where. In addition, your trains look different, depending on the engine and the kind of cargo you're running. This makes managing cargo that much easier, as you can easily identify what needs to be shipped by looking at the cars instead of the cargo names. Instead, it's the sound that disappoints in this game. While the game features a nice bluegrass tune over the main menus, the actual gameplay is devoid of any background music, leaving you to go slowly insane listening to the chug-a-lug sounds of your trains and the cash register noise whenever they deliver to a station. Solid gameplay, numerous options, and attention to detail make Railroad Tycoon II an excellent simulation. While the premise of running a virtual railroad might not be as exciting as other sim games, Railroad Tycoon II keeps things interesting with a complex game mechanic that hides behind a simple layout. While the lack of a save feature could have made this game that much more bearable, Railroad Tycoon II still lets the child inside you build the railroad of your dreams while the adult inside you keeps it running.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

K-1 Revenge,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['K-1 Revenge packs more graphic power, more fighters, and more features than the original K-1, but is it enough? Fans of the first K-1 are sure to think so, but for all intents and purposes, this is the same game all over again.  <P>K-1 Revenge features five modes of play: single-player mode, versus mode, eight-player tournament mode, team-battle mode, and a training mode. The training mode wasn\'t in the first K-1, and is simply a chance to try out your techniques. There is also a new AI feature that lets you tweak each fighter in a number of categories. These categories range from overall defensive and offense options to individual kick-and-punch options of regularity and intensity. Each fighter still has his own specialty; Stan the Man can throw wicked left and right hooks, Sam Greco\'s roundhouse is a lethal weapon, and Andy Hug has an axe kick that can dislocate most shoulders. In addition to the eight fighters in the first game, seven more have been added for a total of 15 real fighters. Three more secret fighters can be unlocked if your skills are good enough. <P>The controls are as simple as they were in the first game: The D-pad moves your fighter toward and away from your opponent, the shoulder buttons sidestep, while the buttons on the face of the controller execute punches, kicks, and special attacks. If you press up or down on the D-pad while pressing an attack button you\'ll vary the height and/or type of attack. The game, as you might imagine, consists of punching and kicking your opponent until his energy is depleted. In the course of this simple goal, you can fill up your opponents knockdown meter by landing several combos. Once his knockdown meter is full he crumbles to the mat. The knockdown meter makes the game fun, because when you see that your opponent is in trouble you can press the attack and try to score a knockdown or even possibly a knockout. <P>Graphically, K-1 Revenge looks ten times better than its predecessor, with smoother animation and cleaner, more defined, polygons. The faces of the characters look just like the real fighters. K-1 Revenge does something graphically that the first K-1 doesn\'t. The fighters leave afterimages, or tracers, behind them as they move backward or sidestep. I can only imagine the designers used this graphic technique to give the illusion that the fighters are moving at incredible speeds; it doesn\'t, though.  <P>On the audio end, K-1 Revenge has some pretty good music. The music at the title screen, for instance, sounds suspiciously like the Van Halen classic ""Running With the Devil."" The music played during the bouts perfectly matches the fast-paced action of the fights. <P>If you have ever seen a kickboxing or boxing match on TV, you know what real punches sounds like. It\'s baffling to me why the designers of K-1 wouldn\'t just use the actual sound of a real punch instead of the usual fighting-game sound effects. Although the punches don\'t sound real, the sound effect of the fighters hitting the canvas is awesome; it really sounds like someone smashing into a mat. <P>Overall, K-1 Revenge is a solid kickboxing game, but K-1 is a kickboxing game - it has no fireballs, dragon punches, or hardly any special techniques, for that matter. In comparison with other PlayStation fighters it may seem boring. Compared with something more conventional like Knockout Kings, the game lacks some of the strategic finesse but has more of an arcade/fighting game feel. In the end, unless you\'re really into kickboxing, this sequel falls squarely into the rent-me bin, just as its predecessor does, due to the game\'s brevity and lack of depth. --Ryan MacDonald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Despite several attempts by game developers to prove otherwise, the PlayStation controller doesn't do well in place of a mouse. That, combined with the PlayStation hardware's limitations, may be why such games as Broken Sword II are not commonplace on Sony's machine. Even though point-and-click adventure games have been around for years on the PC, the PlayStation has been fairly devoid of them. And while the original Broken Sword was held back by its difficult interface and almost unbearable loading times, the sequel makes point-and-click adventures seem almost doable on the PlayStation. But though the loading times have been trimmed and the interface has been fixed, it's still the PlayStation's limitations, not the compelling storyline or the game's quirky sense of humor, that keep Broken Sword from achieving its potential. Once again you're walking in the shoes of George Stobbard, the jack-of-all-trades American who saved the world in the first Broken Sword game. Nico, Stobbard's prissy French girlfriend, has been kidnapped, and it's up to you to help him escape from a burning house and track down the girl's abductors. But more importantly, you must figure out exactly what's going on. Indeed, this story is about more than just girlfriends and poisonous spiders - you'll run into CIA agents, cocaine lords, power-hungry dictators, mysterious scientists, Mayan artifacts, fallen priests, powerful shamans, and other oddball characters who are all extremely good at muddling the plot. Like all good mysteries, once you think you've got a good handle on exactly what's going on, the game yanks your theories out from under you and tosses you back to square one. Are you tracking down a cocaine empire in the hopes of turning it into the authorities, or are you trying to stop a maniacal Mayan priest from resurrecting the god of chaos and evil from his spiritual prison? Whatever your goal, you'll do plenty of traveling. The game starts in Paris, moves around France a bit, then it's off to Mexico, the Caribbean, London, and back again. Not only does this variety give you a great change of scenery every few hours, but it also lets the game introduce distinctly different characters. Instead of spending all your in-game time as Stobbard, there are parts of the game where you assume the role of Nico herself. This makes the game more interesting, as Nico has an entirely different way of dealing with people and situations. Because of her striking cartoony curves, men are more apt to help Nico, but she has a more difficult time doing physical tasks. Stobbard, however, hasn't changed a whole lot since he had his fun in the original Broken Sword. He's still a quirky, cynical bastard with an aspiring MacGyver-like talent that lets him do remarkable things with everyday items. While there are tons of items and puzzles in Broken Sword II, you won't find yourself stuck in any scenario for any lengthy amount of time. If you can't figure something out, it usually means you must go talk to everyone you've met recently all over again, as they'll offer new bits of information they conveniently forgot before. This makes the gameplay almost tedious, because you spend plenty of time listening to people ramble and significantly less time figuring out how to do things such as start a fire with a bank statement and stone figure. Still, there are plenty of creative things to do with all the common items you stumble across in the game, and people looking for at least one or two challenging puzzles will find them. Like its predecessor, the graphics in Broken Sword II are all hand drawn. The graphical style and attention to detail gives Broken Sword II a feel similar to Don Bluth's laser-disc games like Dragon's Lair and Space Ace. But because the environments are actually interactive, the graphics simply don't look as crisp as they would have had thisgame been on laser disc. Details such as faces are rather smudged and difficult to make out, and sometimes the game looks like the screen has been squished into a different size than originally intended. There's also a lot of pixelation around the edges of objects that can easily confuse you as to exactly what it is you're looking at. Still, the backgrounds are well detailed and creative, and the graphical style is a refreshing break from the recent uprising of polygons.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

F1 World Grand Prix 1999,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""F1 World Grand Prix is the second VideoSystem title to bear the name. The first was released a little over a year ago for the N64 and was a solid simulation of F1 racing. Unfortunately, F1 World Grand Prix on the PlayStation suffers from many problems that its N64 counterpart didn't. The largest offense is an inconsistent frame rate that drops when too many cars appear on the screen at once, lowering the overall experience well past the point of being acceptable. The one plus the game has over its competitors is that it has tons of different options and features, letting you set up everything from the cars' performance to specific situations on the track. The game features real teams and drivers, as well as the actual courses from the 1999 F1 racing season. The number of different settings and racing options is truly staggering.  Controlling the cars takes some time to get a handle on. Since the game's frame rate and overall speed slows down when too many cars appear on the screen at once, it's hard to consistently steer the car with the appropriate force when you are playing the game with an analog controller. Modifying your car's various settings, such as wing angles, tires, and gearbox ratios, drastically changes the vehicle's performance. Fans of F1 games who appreciate the subtleties of F1 tweaking will surely enjoy the vast options that F1 World Grand Prix provides. However, fans who just want a visceral racing experience that doesn't require any knowledge of car physics will find the game's control to be a mystery. Visually, F1 World Grand Prix looks a little washed out. The car models are accurate, as are the tracks. Unfortunately, as mentioned before, the game's frame rate takes a dip when too many cars are on the screen. This slowdown hampers your efforts and often leaves you wondering exactly what happened, especially when a collision occurs and your car is left disabled.  In the audio department, the game does a decent job of representing the sounds of an actual track. The cars' high-pitched engine sounds scream in the key of annoyance, and the tires squeal as you slide off the track and bang into the wall.  In the end, F1 World Grand Prix's inconsistent frame rate prevents the game from being playable. While one certainly can appreciate all of the simulation options that the game has to offer; the gameplay and graphics simply don't back it up, and what results is a total mess.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Independence Day,,"['1 or 2 Players', 'Rated; Kids to Adults - Mild Violence']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Got a few minutes to save the world? Based on the hit movie <I>Independence Day</I>, this  PlayStation game puts you on a mission to rescue Earth from total destruction. With more than 13 levels of  gameplay, <I>ID4</I> from Fox Interactive lets you fly and dogfight your fighter jet over several  endangered cities and regions, including New York, Las Vegas, Tokyo, Moscow, the Grand Canyon, and  the highly-classified Area 51.', 'For each level, you will be given clear and concise mission goals. Once these basic objectives are complete,  you will then move on to engage the alien destroyers that hover precariously above each city. Destroy the  aliens before entering into a final confrontation with the alien mothership.', 'Prepare for battle by building up a fleet of defenders from a selection of 10 fighter jets, which include the  FA-18 Hornet, Su-27 Flanker, and A-10 Thunderbolt. Saving the world on your own is rewarding, but you  can also go head-to-head with your friends for some dogfight dueling in this game\'s split-screen mode. This  game also supports the (separately sold) <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000205YB/${0}"">Nyko Sony  Play Link Cable</a> for full-screen two-player combat. <I>--Sal Barcia</I>', 'I automatically cringe when I hear about a game based on a television or movie license. Inevitably the game disappoints (excluding, of course, Die Hard Trilogy and the Star Trek: The Next Generation pinball machine). Sadly, Fox Interactive\'s Independence Day does nothing to alleviate my cringing.. Rather, it falls in line with the ""great box, nice FMV, mediocre game"" model we\'ve seen so many times before. <P>Independence Day features over a dozen missions that parallel the plot of the movie. This means you\'ll engage the alien menace everywhere from Tokyo and the Grand Canyon to the inside of the alien\'s Mothership. You begin by flying a heavily armed F/A 18 Hornet and upgrade to a new, more powerful, aircraft when you come across power-ups. These bonus vehicles include ten different fighter planes and an alien fighter ship. However, each only lasts until you crash or get shot down. And no matter which craft you pilot, each mission is easily navigated, mostly because every encounter is task-oriented. <P>Your objectives are fairly straightforward. Unfortunately though, each new challenge is roughly the same as the previous ones. In the first mission you are out to destroy the ""force field generators."" Your third mission is to destroy the ""satellite uplinks."" In both cases you fly around, use your radar to locate your targets, lock on, and destroy them with your heat seeking missiles. Each new level brings a sense of deja vu that can make the Eiffel Tower level feel the same as the Grand Canyon. And surprisingly - and most disappointingly - the last level is the easiest in the game. <P>ID4, the game, also features a head-to-head mode that\'s playable via split-screen or linked play. This offers a break from the one-player monotony - that is if you have two PlayStations and two televisions side by side. Independence Day isn\'t a total waste of time; rather, it\'s a so-so game. The full motion video is pretty cool and it\'s neat to hear Will Smith\'s voice. But if that\'s what you\'re after, rent the movie. --Ed Robertson <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Unfortunately, <i>Bass Hunter 64</i> is not one of them.

Thousand Arms,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Game disc only in generic DVD case. No Manual. Disc has light to moderate scratches that do not affect playability. All of our games are tested before being placed into inventory.', 'Thousand Arms is the story of Meis Triumph, scion of the venerable Triumph clan - overlords of the town of Kant and spirit blacksmiths for seven generations. One day, the dark acolytes attack the slumbering village, and Meis is thrown out of his ancestral home. Barely reaching the capital city, Boyzby, he meets Sodina, a young girl whose brother, Jyabil, happens to be a master spirit blacksmith. Jyabil takes Meis as an apprentice, but the Dark Acolytes have their sights set on Boyzby as well... thus, the story unfolds.', ""Thousand Arms is an RPG, and it's got all the standard trappings of one - if you've played any game in the genre, Thousand Arms should be immediately accessible. Red Company, the developer, has been at this for years, spawning many immensely popular titles - Sega's Sakura Wars, for example - that unfortunately haven't been released in the United States. The company's expertise shows; nothing seems awkward or out of place, and it all flows."", ""What makes Thousand Arms unique is the master system, in which you use your powers as a spirit blacksmith to reforge your party's weapons, adding power and spells to them. Where do you draw this mystical power from? Being a spirit blacksmith is tough; in addition to the master points you use to reshape the metal, you'll need the support of a girl to achieve your results. That's where the dating elements of this game come in."", 'Now, dating games have not historically been well received in the US. That\'s not exactly true; they\'ve never really had the opportunity. Talk to a random sampling of people and you\'ll either hear derisive snickers or fanatical devotion. Either extreme is pretty silly - dating scenes might sound like the last refuge of the socially inept, but they\'re just a lighthearted aside to the game\'s main thrust: the tried-and-true RPG quest. They offer a welcome breather from saving the world. The format is this: Sodina, or whoever, will pose a question to Meis, and you must pick one of two options as an answer. Obviously, the aim is to please her. If the date goes well, your intimacy factor grows by a point, and your blacksmithing ability is thereby increased as well. In addition to normal ""dates,"" you can play minigames that boost your statistics with a girl. Sodina\'s cooking attack basically plays like that old Simon smack-the-colored-lights game. Additionally, each town has a shop in which you can buy presents for girls, although the best presents are hidden in deep corners of dungeons.', ""The graphics are simply excellent. Everything is polygonal, except for your characters, which are sprites. This holds true in the battles, as well. The level of artistry is quite high - the houses in the towns are littered with sundry items and decoration, and the texture maps are both detailed and varied. Your town/dungeon sprites are small, superdeformed, and generally humorous, but in battle you will be treated to full-size characters that look as though they stepped out of an anime cel. There's also a smattering of high-quality FMV, which is a mixture of computer-generated backgrounds and anime characters."", ""The game has a very humorous presentation and loads of cel artwork - any time a scene with any importance is about to happen, the camera swings around to a close-up shot of the characters in fully hand-drawn anime style. There is also a lot of extremely well-done voice acting in the game - Sodina and Meis, especially, are full of emotion, and they carry the weight of their lines extremely well. The dating scenes are extremely amusing, and a lot of it has to do with Sodina's reactions, which may vary from infatuation to disgust; it's always quite obvious how she feels."", 'One of the most important aspects of an RPG is the battle system; after all, you\'re going to be spending a lot of time with it. Thousand Arms\' battles will feel familiar, but they are a little bizarre. It\'s easiest to compare them to other games: They have elements from Namco\'s LMB system (the Tales series) in that your characters are all flat anime characters on a 3D background. They\'re like Square\'s ATB system (Final Fantasy) because a real-time gauge governs the timing of attacks, and there\'s no action element. The strangest thing has to be that the front character (in both enemy and player parties) is the only one who can make any kind of offensive move, be it a physical attack or a spell. The only thing back-row characters can do is cast help spells and use items. Occasionally, they\'ll cheer you or taunt the enemies, marginally affecting stats. This might be the only game where those ""spell in a bottle"" items are extremely useful.', ""The game has a strong anime aesthetic - sometimes cute, sometimes wacky, and definitely attractive. The enemies are downright absurd and generally worth a laugh. The dialogue is too, though as is true of the genre, high drama can cut in at any moment. Atlus definitely has a great game on its hands here - the combination of solid RPG questing, graphics, dialogue, dubbing, and ambiance really push this game over the edge from standard to special. Game-playing anime fans will get a big kick out of it, and it's the first real example of a decent dating simulation in the US. Any RPG fans who like amusing situations, animated (in both senses of the word) characters, and challenging gameplay will enjoy this title. Fans of Lunar, especially, should check this one out. Because RPGs aren't that rare anymore, good ones stand out that much more. Hopefully, Thousand Arms won't be swept under in the fourth-quarter flood. --Christian Nutt <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Nascar Challenge,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Game Boy Color', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""NASCAR Challenge is a dull racing game that doesn't have much going for it. Aside from the list of licensed drivers, there is very little to make you want to play this title. There are only three tracks to choose from, one car, one musical score that is played relentlessly unless disabled, and a screen that is so monotonous it could be used in hypnotherapy. The cartridge comes with its own rumble pak attached, but the only time you'll be feeling it shake is if you touch another car... which, actually, can be quite often. The main problem with this game is that the track is just too narrow. There is almost no room to pass other cars, and the slightest collision will leave you spinning out like a top as the rest of the competition sails by. Delicate tapping of the gas pedal can give you room to maneuver around your opponents, but for some reason your car suffers from extreme deceleration when moving at anything less than top speed, so if you brake to avoid rear-ending a car in front of you that car will suddenly be miles ahead of you down the track. Only half of the screen is used in NASCAR Challenge: The top half simply has a fixed background with trees, houses, and clouds that glide by horizontally. Only the bottom half of the screen has any relevance to the game, making it resemble old 8-bit titles that filled up much of the screen with static information to give the appearance that there was more to the game than there actually was while also giving the processor more time to do its job. Players can't choose the number of laps to race in the competitive mode, and the default setting (six) is much too long for a racer since there is little to do other than occasionally take a few tight turns and avoid cars. The fact that half of the screen is fixed doesn't help, and watching the small amount of action there is doesn't justify giving this game more than a brief look.<i>--Doug Trueman</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Warhammer: Rites of War - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Based on the award-winning <i>Panzer General 2</i> game system, this turn-based strategy game is easy to play but filled with deep strategies that are a challenge to master. Substantially upgraded from its famous predecessor, <i>Rites of War</i> has units that are twice as large and are animated when they move, attack, and die. And when it comes to battle, you won't be alone--cooperative and head-to-head multiplayer support will inspire you to hone your survival skills."", ""Of all the computer games inspired by Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 tabletop science-fiction wargame, Rites of War is the first to place the fanatical Imperium of Man in a peripheral role. Suddenly the space marines are the enemy, and the game centers on the proud and mighty Eldar, a fallen race still clinging to life thanks to remarkable technology and limitless courage. Fans of the source material will no doubt appreciate the opportunity posed by Rites of War to take on the Imperium with the Eldar's alien weapons and will be further pleased to learn that they'll face the Tyranid as well, who haven't shown their ugly faces on the computer screen since Space Hulk. Together, these three races are a fascinating bunch, so much so that they clearly influenced their counterparts in Blizzard's wildly popular real-time strategy game Starcraft. Even so, they still can't save Rites of War from feeling like the typical and underwhelming turn-based strategy game that it is."", ""The Eldar may be a mysterious race indeed, but what's especially mysterious about Rites of War is why its system requirements are so steep. The fact is, Rites of War looks like a very old game, largely because it runs on the two-year-old Panzer General II graphics engine, which arguably didn't even look that great for its time. Yet while mediocre graphics are acceptable in the turn-based strategy genre, poor performance is not. You'd think smooth, fast gameplay would be the least a developer could offer, when having to work with an old graphics engine. But you can expect sluggish performance from Rites of War even if you exceed its preposterously high minimum requirements."", ""If you can get it running, you'll find that Rites of War plays more like a wargame and not so much like its source material. Most missions have you moving around 15 units one by one over a hex-based map in an effort to defeat your enemies or claim their territory. The majority of these units can only attack adjacent hexes, at which point the game compares unit stats for initiative, strength, toughness, and so forth to resolve the combat. You'll need a variety of units to succeed; tactical units are useful in any situation but are vulnerable to artillery. Artillery can soften up most any target from long range, although assault units can easily destroy them or most anything else if they can get close enough. Devastator units are especially important, and while slow, their powerful attacks can provide cover fire for their allies. Scouts can see far ahead and attack without fear of retaliation, catching their foes by surprise. You'll also deploy aerial units, war machines, and psykers with their devastating psychic powers. True to its source, Rites of War feels well balanced, and all three of its sides play differently yet are similarly powerful. It's an interesting and effective variation on the Warhammer 40,000 rules, although its combat is regrettably far less visceral than the preceding Warhammer 40,000 strategy games Chaos Gate and Final Liberation."", ""Part of the reason is Rites of War just doesn't look or sound very good. Though the game is colorful, and its maps are fairly detailed and cleanly rendered, the unit graphics themselves look sloppy and animate so poorly that you'll wonder whether it's your computer rather than the game that's at fault. If you're very familiar with the pewter Warhammer 40,000 miniatures that the six-dozen-odd units in Rites of War are taken from, then you'll be able to distinguish the game's renderings of a Howling Banshee Exarch from a Dire Avenger without too much trouble. But if you aren't so experienced with the source material, the game's units will utterly fail to convey the detail and charisma that helped make the tabletop wargame so popular. The units aren't shown to scale, either - a fact that will put your ability to suspend disbelief to a serious test. Even behemoths such as the Tyranid Carnifex are reduced to the size of everything else. Consequently, the battles in Rites of War are abstracted so much that you'll need to work hard to convince yourself that some important battle is raging, even more so than you would playing the original game on a table with metal figurines."", ""Rites of War includes a linear campaign of two dozen missions, each of whose scenarios are introduced through a rather strikingly well-acted speech from your commanding officer, the Farseer. Unfortunately, aside from the Farseer's impassioned diatribes against the Eldar's enemies, the campaign is otherwise fairly straightforward, with few twists within the missions themselves and little cohesion between missions. The real incentive to keep playing is that your units gain experience as they fight, becoming noticeably more powerful as they do so. Most Eldar units are promoted to Exarch status once they become sufficiently experienced, turning the once-vulnerable warriors into seemingly invincible warlords."", ""While the experience system is mostly well implemented, it does have certain problems. For one thing, Exarch units are so astonishingly powerful that a lot of the game's strategy is lost once you've amassed a few of them. All but the deadliest artillery fire and most vicious melee attacks are completely shrugged aside, and an Exarch's wounds can be instantly healed by resting for a turn. You'll quickly realize how overpowered these units are and thus why many of the later missions in the game enforce a turn limit, demanding that you accomplish your goal hastily. Furthermore, once your units have attained maximum experience, all of a sudden you've lost that incentive to keep on going with them. And, provided you can keep them alive, your units will max out about two-thirds of the way through the game, making the last portion seem stale. Meanwhile, purchasing new units at this late stage in the campaign is pointless since they'll be nothing more than fodder to the experienced enemy, and will perish long before they gain any experience of their own."", ""Even in spite of these concerns, the Rites of War campaign is fairly enjoyable, with enough variety between missions and enough challenge within them to keep you interested. Since you're limited by the number of units you can deploy in each mission, and invariably not all of your units will survive the course of the campaign, there's even some incentive to play the campaign a second time to try things differently and maybe at a higher difficulty setting. Otherwise, you can play around a dozen stand-alone scenarios against the computer or against up to three other people, and Rites of War also includes an editor that lets you modify starting and victory conditions and such, without actually letting you modify the physical appearance of the available maps. And because the game contains dozens of Eldar, Imperial, and Tyranid units, Rites of War can keep you busy for a good while."", ""As you play, you'll realize that the ultimate purpose of translating Warhammer 40,000 to the computer is at least twofold: The first is to eliminate the time-consuming hassle of physically playing a tabletop wargame. And the second purpose, far more difficult to accomplish, is to express the fiction more vividly through the computer game medium than is feasible on a kitchen table. Rites of War fails in this respect, which is unfortunate since its setup is so inspiring. And because the tabletop game's context is so rich, and because, at its heart, Rites of War proves to be fairly enjoyable if you can get past all its many rough edges, the game finally comes across as a missed opportunity to show off Warhammer 40,000 in all its glory. <i>--Greg Kasavin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Juggernaut - Playstation 1,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Freeway veterans know the kiss of death: a slow-moving car in the passing lane. When boxed in, speedy drivers are forced to suffer slowly behind these traffic-jam instigators. That frustrating feeling of moving slow and being powerless to do anything about it encapsulates the experience of playing through Juggernaut, a point-and-click puzzle adventure that, to paraphrase Austin Powers, puts the ""ger"" in meager gameplay, baby. <P>This three-CD game starts with a fairly unconventional plot: A girlfriend possessed by an evil spirit needs the player to warp into her twisted soul to save her. However, the gameplay is strictly cookie cutter: Move, gather items, then use intellect and/or items to solve puzzles that will ultimately rid the evil from the player\'s gal pal. <P>The main problem with this first-person point-and-click game is that there\'s not much to point and click at. Game screens have only one or two items to select, at most - a drawer or an object - and the rest is eye candy. Gameplay would\'ve been more exciting if players could interact with the game screens and explore them in greater detail. That shortfall in both detail and animation makes players feel as though they\'re walking from one painted game screen to another, which dulls the excitement level immensely. Compounding the dullness are transition FMV screens that shuttle players from one screen to the next. These slow the game\'s pace to boredom-inducing levels. <P>That\'s not the only complaint. Frankly, most puzzles are too easy. A few ask youto memorize and repeat sound or visual patterns - those aren\'t too bad. Worse are the mindless puzzles that get ""solved"" after you visit different areas randomly. For example, a character will give you a password only after you have visited a nearby area twice. You\'re only going to solve that puzzle after wandering from screen to screen - hardly the definition of challenging fun. <P>In addition, many of the puzzles are made difficult not by being challenging intellectually, but by the fact that you must backtrack repeatedly to solve them. For instance, in the mansion stage, you must switch between small and large bodies to explore different areas. Every time you have to make a body switch to solve a puzzle, you must run back to the nearest switching station. This task gets tedious after time, especially if the switching stations are far away. <P>Juggernaut lacks the presentation savvy found in other video games. Most conversations are text-only, with sparse audio effects for background music and sound effects - painfully vanilla for a three-disc game. Despite extensive full-motion video sequences, the prerendered screens seem more suited to a first-generation title. <P>This game has a few redeeming qualities that should be noted. The idea of using different ""bodies"" to explore the game\'s mansion stage is indeed unique for a puzzle game - meaning that you need a certain body type to enter a given area of the mansion. The game\'s surreal plot, while convoluted and often hard to follow, makes for unique exploration stages, such as one where you surf the Internet in the year 2250, or another where you visit a village where all the murdered residents lack their eyeballs.... now if that\'s not the definition of a convoluted plot, what is? Finally, the game\'s storyline does get better once the second disc is popped in, but the puzzles remain woefully unchallenging. <P>Juggernaut\'s slow-paced gameplay and bare-bones interactivity make for a lackluster game - one that only patient puzzle fanatics could embrace. For the rest, switch lanes and pass this title up. --Nelson Taruc <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Team Losi RC Racer,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Team Losi RC Racer is a 3D racing game that puts you in control of RC cars. Unfortunately, it's not the 3D RC Pro-Am that many had been hoping for. Instead, RC Racer is plagued with problems in just about every category. You're still better off with your 8-bit copy of RC Pro-Am"", ""The interface for selecting levels to race is done in a Mario 64-like fashion. You drive your car around in a 3D environment and pick a level portal that transports your car to the course you choose. While it worked perfectly for Mario, there's really no need for such an intricate and confusing method for a racing game. After you complete a handful of tracks you drive around trying to find portals that you haven't already entered."", 'Once you start a race, you go up against four other computer-controlled RC cars. If you end up in any position other than first, you must race the level all over again. Once you place first in all of the tracks within a section, a new area opens up with more tracks and new cars. Eventually you end up with a total of 15 courses and 16 cars.', ""The racing here is hardly about how tight you take turns but instead is all about making it through the correct order of the colored gates. If you hit three gates in the correct sequence, your car gets brief power-ups, like freezing time for a moment, speed bursts, and a little shield thing that makes other cars lose control when they touch you. The game is fairly easy; all you have to do is go for the gates and win. The only time you really fall behind is when you get turned around after rolling and can't tell at first what direction you're facing."", ""The control is really good if you're using a Dual Shock pad since it performs just like a real RC car controller. The left analog stick lets you steer the car, while the other controls your speed. Unfortunately, if you only have a regular controller, the control is horrible. You are constantly pressing left and right on the D-pad to try to keep the car moving in a forward direction."", ""Visually, Team Losi is pretty rough around the edges. The camera view is the typical behind-the-car driving-game view. Unfortunately, the camera view bounces a lot when the car hops over bumps in the course. This constant camera motion not only makes it hard to keep track of your car's position in the environment, but also strains your eyes after a while. As if that's not bad enough, some of the tracks in the game suffer from horrendous pop-up, letting you watch the track fill in right before your eyes. This is quite annoying since you can't see what's coming up in front of you. This problem is compounded by the game's uneven frame rate that drops quite significantly when all the cars appear onscreen. The music is kind of funky, not bad funky, just kind of generic funky. The sound effects are believable enough although kind of annoying - which also describes the game as a whole."", 'Overall, Team Losi RC Racer is a below-average racing game, regardless of the RC car gimmick and license.

Carrier,,['fight flesh eating monsters; must navigate an aircraft carrier; two playable characters; on screen map; large number of weapons'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"['Disc(s) only. Ships in generic case. Disc(s) are professoinally cleaned. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', 'In Carrier, Jaleco\'s Resident Evil-style adventure, you play as one of two government agents who\'ve been sent to investigate what\'s happened to an aircraft carrier that\'s lost communication with the mainland. The situation is bad, of course, and it involves an ancient organism that has taken control of the ship and turned most of the crew into hideous kill-crazy mutants. Your goal (as either the big-faced Jack Ingles or the strangely named Jessifer Manning) is to discover what happened, save any survivors, and destroy the menace before the carrier arrives into port. Unfortunately, it seems like for every positive aspect of Carrier, there are one or two drawbacks. The graphics, for example, carry many nice little touches. If you walk through a puddle of blood, you\'ll leave bloody tracks for a few steps, and dispatched enemies dissolve into a wonderfully gruesome puddle. At the same time, the game\'s many explosions come off as half-hearted fizzles, and when water appears, it\'ll take you a moment to recognize what it is. Likewise, the rendered backgrounds look very sharp, full of metal walkways and machines that have a believable shine to them. But if those environments are populated with a lot of objects or growths, and most are, the frame rate slows to a crawl. (In fact, boss fights routinely drop you down to a slow-motion jog.) The monster designs are also fairly inventive, full of zombies that sprout sharpened ribs from their chests and split-headed mutants that try to bite you with what was once their faces. But if two attack you at the same time, the second will... walk through you. Similarly, the music and sound effects have some great moments that help build tension, but there are many instances where a scream or song sounds so inappropriate as to jar you out of the mood as well. The voice-overs have much the same feel as those in Resident Evil 2. That is, some are completely normal but every now and again there\'s the odd ""Don\'t shoot! I\'m a human!"" The control is - for the most part - good though. You\'ll get spoiled by not having to hit a button to climb stairs and using the analog pad to move has you run as a default, two elements where Carrier exceeds the current genre standard, Resident Evil: Code Veronica. The overall feel is much like that of Resident Evil actually, with a few slight changes. Instead of an auto-aiming feature, Carrier provides a target to show you if you\'ve lined up your weapon\'s sight with a mutant\'s chest or head. The aiming system works well except when you\'re being attacked by a creature that\'s crawling along on the floor. You might have your gun trained down at an ankle biter, but if it sinks its teeth into you, your aim will default to straight ahead, and it\'s likely that you\'ll get bitten again before you can target it again properly. The recent addition to the Resident Evil line of a 180-degree spin move also appears in Carrier, but it\'s so easy to perform here that you\'ll often end up doing it accidentally. One major difference between the Resident Evil series and Carrier is that there\'s a rudimentary first-person mode within Carrier\'s main game. Early into the title, you gain special goggles that you can use to detect infection in those around you, scan rooms for objects, and see through blocked areas. But their main advantage is that they let you see beyond the normally visible screen. A common problem in survival-horror games is that having fixed camera angles within the environments keeps you from seeing if there are creatures just out of sight in the room with you. In Carrier, you can use the goggles to look around from a first-person perspective, eliminating any possible surprises. Another nice touch is the map system, which - once you\'ve gained the map data for a level - shows which areas you haven\'t accessed yet and sometimes highlights rooms you have to return to. Carrier does take longer than many games in the genre to complete, but that\'s mainly because there\'s a lot of ground to cover, and much of your time is spent backtracking. The map system saves you from having to wonder where you\'re supposed to go, though you\'ll still have to run around a lot, as keys and security controls are rarely found near the areas they unlock. For example, when playing as Jessifer, you\'ll use the security computer to open a door on a lower deck. An elevator is fairly close, but it is located near a section that\'s blocked off from the door you want to go through. Instead, you must travel to a catwalk that is close to the security computer, but because of a broken door sensor, you have to run all the way around the entire deck to get to it. And instances like that aren\'t rare. On the positive side, there are two characters to play as, as in most of the Resident Evil games, though Jessifer\'s scenario (the second) is much shorter than Jack\'s.  There are several minor points of contention too, such as bombs sometimes vanish if you\'re interrupted during a countdown and the fact that some enemies are so slow that the only way they can get you is if you stop to shoot them. These are not major problems in and of themselves, but along with the slowdown and the constant backtracking, they do add up. In the end, Carrier isn\'t an awful game, and it really does manage to grow on you after a while, but it definitely has problems. It\'s worth buying if you\'re an absolute survival-horror nut, but otherwise you might want to look into picking it up as a rental.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

NHL Championship 2000 - PlayStation,,['1-8 Players'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""The people over at Fox interactive know hockey, and it shows in how well NHL Championship 2000 looks, plays, and feels. The physics are so realistic that a lot of video-game hockey fans may actually be turned off by it. NHL Championship 2000's gameplay is more realistic than that of any hockey game out there, which can be viewed as good or bad, depending on your tastes. If you're a fan of the fast-paced, responsive control of Electronic Arts' NHL 2000, you may find the realistic momentum-based physics of NHL 2000 to be unresponsive. But if you're a purist of the sport, and you realize that players can't really start, stop, and turn instantly, you might be able to appreciate the more true-to-life physics of NHL Championship 2000. The game's options and features are in tune with the game's true-to-life gameplay. NHL Championship 2000 includes all the players and teams from the NHL, as well as 18 international teams. The game has several modes of play, including exhibition, season, playoffs, championship, and a world tournament. Of course, all of the arenas and little extras - like different team jerseys - are in the game, along with a create-a-player mode. It should be noted that one feature NHL Championship 2000 doesn't skimp on is statistical tracking. Compared with NHL 2000 or Face Off 2000, NHL Championship 2000 has several more stat categories.    The AI is probably the best of any of the hockey games on the PlayStation, but that's not to say it's flawless. The three levels of difficulty are dramatically different, letting you really set the game to match your skills. Whatever setting you pick will seem refreshing - actually, tiring is more like it, since every computer player on the ice is constantly working you to get the puck when you have it, or setting up for a shot when it has possession of the puck. When you bump the difficulty setting up, the whole game gets meaner and more aggressive. It also plays much smarter. The management controls for team strategy are not only in-depth, but it is also designed well enough to let you easily select what type of game plan you want to run. There are a few problems that are somewhat annoying, but they don't really take away from the game. For instance, the computer gets called for offsides more than it really should. You may want to disable the offsides rule to remedy this.  The graphics in NHL Championship 2000 are just about on par with everything else on the market. The animations of the players gliding down the ice, shooting, fighting, and making saves are quite good. The players are fairly detailed, and all the team logos and jerseys look authentic. The walls around the rink are adorned with advertisements, and the glass will break if you get slammed, or if you slam somebody into it hard enough. You can view all the action on the ice from six camera angles, all of which are quite good. In addition, you can zoom in and out from each angle to accommodate your taste.  The play-by-play and pregame announcing by Fox Sports announcers John Davidson and Kenny Albert is really great. The rest of the sound gets the job done, though the drone of the crowd sounds weak in comparison with the noise of the crowd in other games. In the end, whether NHL Championship 2000 is the game for you depends on whether or not you're looking for a realistic hockey simulation. EA's faster, more responsive NHL 2000 is the obvious choice if you're looking for a faster, more hectic hockey game.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Dragon Seeds,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['The virtual-pet craze is now officially in full swing. First it was Bandai\'s Digimons and Nintendo\'s Pokemons. Then came the Tamagotchis and all their sassy ways. Eventually, Tecmo decided to take a crack at it and came away with the surprisingly good Monster Rancher, a game that gets better with every play. Of course, with all this success, it became apparent that kids like to breed monsters in the comfort of their own homes without all the mess of a real pet. Consequently, here comes Jaleco (makers of Speed Racer, Tetris Plus, and, err, Punky Skunk) with its offering to the ever-growing canon of virtual monsters. The game is called Dragonseeds. <P>Dragonseeds is basically the same thing as Monster Rancher, in theme at least, if not actual execution. The problem is that it\'s not nearly as good. The gimmick here is that Dragonseeds reads whatever memory saves you have on the memory card inserted into the PlayStation. From this data the game generates a monster that you will then raise and take into battle. Now as far as the monsters are concerned, they\'re actually pretty cool. They\'re rendered in full 3D, and there\'s a large variety of them as well. They all look really solid, and the graphics are brightly colored and well designed. Considering that everyone probably has a different set of saves on his memory card, there\'ll be a lot of different monsters floating around out there.  <P>Another problem is that the game is really kind of pointless. All the towns and townspeople are represented by a simple screen with flat 2D sprites that don\'t animate very much. You go from location to location and ""interact"" with the people who will, among other things, help you generate monsters, train them, sell you items, and give you advice. When you\'re not doing these tedious tasks, you\'ll be in the arena pitting your creations against others. The thing that ruins the game is the rock-scissors-paper nature of the battles. While something like this works well with Pokemon games, it doesn\'t succeed here. After all, what\'s the point of buying the best items for your monster and raising its levels so diligently if the success of your battle is based more on luck than anything else? It is precisely this flaw that keeps Dragonseeds from being better than just OK. The unfortunate thing is that this is the whole draw of the game, isn\'t it - to create cool monsters and engage in strategic battles, hoping that your monster is fit to be king. <P>When compared with a game as deep and personable as Monster Rancher, Dragonseeds pales in comparison. Though it may provide some respite while the world waits for Monster Rancher 2, it\'s hardly an acceptable substitute. Fans of this kind of game may want to rent it, just to see what their memory cards bring them. Everyone else may just want to stay away. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Tail Concerto: Playstation 1,,"['9 levels with detailed 3D rendered graphics, variety of weapons, items, and upgrades, variety of animated cut-scenes and interactive characters']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Tail Concerto is an action-adventure platforming game featuring three-dimensional characters and environments. Players control the character Waffle, who pilots a semi-humanoid mecha called the ""Police Robo"" with the ability to run, jump, climb on ledges, and hover in mid-air for brief periods.', 'After bouncing between Activision and a few other US publishers, Tail Concerto has finally been released in the US. Originally developed by toy mega-marketer Bandai, Tail Concerto represents a shockingly uncharacteristic attention to originality and production value. A delightful, light 3D platformer perfect for gamers of all ages, Tail Concerto doesn\'t quite live up to its potential, but it is enjoyable all the same. <P>Tail Concerto takes place in the fantasy world of Prairie, a floating archipelago inhabited by bipedal, anthropomorphized dogs and cats. Racial strife is rampant - the cats of the world, lacking government representation, feel oppressed by the dogs who rule over Prairie. Three feline sisters, Alicia, Flare, and Stare recruit a small army of adorable kittens and form the Black Cats Gang, a radical military organization designed to help the cats split away and form their own nation. Influenced by the nefarious Fool, they seek five legendary crystals, which they believe can create a nation for them. Unbeknownst to the three sisters, the crystals are actually the key to resurrecting the Iron Giant, an apocalyptic robot whose enormous pieces are embedded throughout Prairie\'s islands. Enter Waffle, a work-a-day cop with a floppy-armed robotic suit. Having foiled the Black Cat Gang\'s first attacks, Waffle gets the unfortunate assignment of locking up the three sisters, as well as apprehending any minions encountered along the way. <P>As cliche as much of Tail Concerto\'s story is, its gameplay is surprisingly fresh for a 3D platformer. Waffle\'s suit is equipped with a bubble gun, a teleport device, and the aforementioned floppy arms. The bubble gun will can damage any enemy vehicles, as well as temporarily immobilize any fleeing kittens. After grabbing the cats, Waffle tosses them into the teleporter on his back, instantaneously whisking them away to prison. On a more sadistic note, Waffle can also pick up pieces of furniture in people\'s houses and smash them against walls, serving no real purpose in the game. More useful, especially on the bosses, is the ability to pick up and lob back the bombs that the enemies generally attack with. Waffle\'s suit can also perform a majority of the other 3D platformer basics, such as climb and move hand-over-hand while hanging. In one stage, Waffle can equip his suit with a jetpack, fly about a huge debris field, and hop from island to island, occasionally pausing to let his jets cool. Even though Tail Concerto is primarily an action game, a number of little quests, spoken dialogue, and anime cutscenes are liberally scattered throughout the game to move the story forward and keep the game from becoming mindless. <P>Prairie is a beautifully envisioned 3D world, complete with forests, floating reefs of island debris, and huge mechanical fortresses. Virtually every surface is textured, and each environment is alive with animation and detail. Tail Concerto\'s 3D engine is speedy enough, but it has a high rate of polygon dropout and sorting errors. The game\'s camera intelligently pans most of the time, but it has trouble in some tight places. During action scenes, you can adjust the camera\'s position relative to Waffle, allowing for some minor control. Limited as it may be, the standard viewpoint is sufficient almost all the time, with the extra camera angles just helping out in a few situations. The game\'s excellent anime sequences, fluidly animated and lushly colored, also show an impressive level of effort. Tail Concerto\'s music is not as grand as the game\'s title might imply, however. The peaceful and subdued score is fairly hummable, but it does not stand out enough to warrant any special mention. On an unfortunate note, Bandai of Japan deemed the beautiful J-Pop intro song of the Japanese version to be ""for Japan only,"" and replaced it in the US version with a rather weak orchestral piece. The game\'s sound effects are clear and effective, using voice often to tell the game\'s story and add personality to the boss encounters. Atlus\' text and voice adaptation is very well done overall, truly giving the player the feeling of an interactive cartoon. <P>Tail Concerto\'s only real flaw is its length. Experienced players will breeze through the game in less than five hours, almost never having to push the limits of their gaming prowess. The game feels as though it could\'ve been a lot more. For example, the jetpack stage is practically only a bonus stage, but it could\'ve been used as a training session for a real jetpack action scene. Instead, the jetpack is nothing more than a gimmick for one minor quest. With gaping holes of opportunity like that, some players are bound to feel a tinge of dissatisfaction after completing the game. <P>Bandai has an excellent starting point for a series on its hands. Tail Concerto\'s furry world and gameplay basics could create an exceptional game when fleshed out beyond their current state. Even in its current state, however, Tail Concerto is definitely worth a look - games this pleasant and light don\'t come along that often, and they are a welcome change from the norm. --Peter Bartholow <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

ANTZ is giant-sized fun for everyone!"", 'Whether we\'re talking about a major console title or a Game Boy game, it\'s unfortunately all too common for a licensed product to become some feeble effort to use an identifiable name or character in familiar situations to bring in a large amount of cash, with little payoff for the player. And the Game Boy tends to be somewhat of a lint trap for such games, as it\'s an easy (and inexpensive) platform to develop for. Dreamworks Interactives\' animated film Antz inspired the same-named GBC game. It\'s generally a pretty typical Game Boy platform game: You jump, crawl, swing, shoot, and stomp things. The game gives you a singular task at the beginning of each level, so as to give the appearance of being mission-driven, but the end goal is usually there waiting for you, provided you simply make it through all the preliminary 2D platform-game trappings earlier in the round. What\'s redeeming about this game, though, is that new ideas and challenges are introduced early. In the first level, for example, you\'re already swinging from one hook to the next, avoiding sharp objects below. You don\'t just swing from one as a trial, before encountering the spikes later on. You also figure out how to shoot blocks from the ceiling to form a walkway, all within the first few seconds of play. This may still sound remedial, but rest assured, far too may GB platformers wait until halfway through the game before pulling the better rabbits out of their hats. While the order of the day is pretty much lots of hoisting and jumping and stacking Antz so you can climb over them and out of the room, the later levels provide some pretty funny ""from the eyes of the insect world"" tasks that involve escaping ridiculous situations and taking on other creatures in the plentiful bug universe. Essentially, the game controls well, and it\'s moderately enjoyable and varied. Perhaps the largest gripe is another common one in this type of game: If you die, you go back to the beginning of the level. But that\'s what ten-second continue options are for. If you liked the movie, Infogrames wants you to believe you\'ll want to relive the experience with this game. But in all actuality, the movie and the game really have little in common, so base your judgement on gameplay rather than on the fact that it\'s a licensed movie product. Antz on the GBC is another platform game that will amuse those who find the genre enjoyable in small scale 8-bit.<i>--Lauren Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

If you were to substitute all references to ""catz"" with ""dogz"" and change minor details like replacing ""yarn"" with ""stick,"" you would end up with exactly what Saffire has produced. That being said, Dogz is a virtual-pet-type game for the Game Boy. After a visit to the pound, you can choose a dog from one of three different types (mutt, Scottish terrier, Chihuahua) then move it to a virtual playpen, where you must take care of it. You can name your dog, brush it, spray it for fleas, throw it a bone or stick, and feed it as much as you\'d like. Your dog has a list of stats (happiness, health, affection, and so on), which you must maintain to keep it as a pet. If one of these bars falls into the red for too long your dog will defect to someone else\'s virtual pen. Naturally, you can alleviate these negative emotions with care appropriate for your pooch (pet it to raise its affection for you, feed it if it\'s hungry, etc.), but, sadly, the interactivity with your cyberdog ends there. Your dog\'s stats change very slowly over time, so there\'s really nothing to do other than to turn your Game Boy on, watch your dog run around the screen, and wonder why you\'re wasting your time with this title. It\'s not a game in the truest sense of the word; instead, it\'s more like an exercise in philosophy: Why did this title get made? Will people really play it? Will schoolchildren care about it when they could be playing Pokemon instead? What else could I be doing with my time?

Nectaris: Military Madness,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""A pure strategy game is a rare thing these days. While strategy/RPGs have become a popular mainstay in the 32-bit era, a title that harkens back to the glory days of strategy such as Nectaris is welcome indeed. Nectaris is a descendent of the TurboGrafx-16 game known as Military Madness in the US, the game that practically began the 16-bit glory days of strategy. After getting over the game's nostalgic value, some will be disappointed that the game hasn't evolved a bit since its 1989 debut."", ""Being a pure strategy game, Military Madness drops all pretenses and heads straight for the point, after introducing the token back story. The evil Xenon empire has enslaved the Moon, and it's up to an upstart commander, you, to take back the planetoid through pure eradication. To free the besieged piece of rock, you are given control of a handful of futuristic military units and plunked down on the lunar surface to eliminate the enemy forces by either taking control of their base or destroying all of their units. Each unit has its own movement, attack, and defense advantages and disadvantages from which most of the game's strategy is derived. Secondary strategic interplay comes from the moon's varied terrain, which directly affects the vehicles' mobility and defensive ratings. Additionally, factories give you access to additional units and the ability to repair your weakened forces. Abandoning needless detail, Nectaris is surprisingly easy to pick up and play."", ""Gameplay is turn-based, letting you move all of your units before giving control to your opponent. Units are moved around the honeycombed map with two-buttoned ease. When engaging the enemy, the view changes from the staid overhead map to a more dynamic 3D representation of the battle, in which each battalion's eight units duke it out in a by-the-numbers duel. You can enhance your odds by surrounding the enemy, attacking adjacent to a friendly unit, or situating yourself on more defensive terrain. The game's AI remains almost identical to the original's, leaving it somewhat challenging at times but often predictable. However, with over 100 levels, the game will definitely keep you on your mental toes for some time. One of the game's best features is the inclusion of a two-player mode. The multiplayer game is played exactly like the single-player game, just with a hopefully less-predictable opponent. To sweeten the deal, Nectaris includes a map editor to allow you to create your own pockmarked playing fields once you grow tired of those included with the game. As fans of the original will see, nothing has changed here. The units, save a few name changes, are exactly the same as before, and the only real difference is that of new maps to battle on. Some will laud this; some will be upset that the game hasn't changed a lick since 1989."", 'Graphically, Nectaris is dated. While the game\'s maps do look better than the original\'s, there still is very little new or different about the graphics. The most noticeable graphical change, of course, is the polygonal representations of the battles. These seem largely to be a design afterthought, as they tend to draw out combat far longer than the ""line-up-and-shoot"" method of yore. Additionally, they\'re quite dated for today\'s PlayStation graphics, using almost no animation or effects. The game\'s sound is also fairly dated but in a less detracting way. For a wargame, the music is surprisingly soothing, adding a contradictory sense of relaxation to the ensuing carnage. Sound effects are stale, but what else can you do with a game that\'s naturally limited to explosions and assorted vehicular noises?', ""Nostalgia's in, and it's cool that a new generation will get a chance to play one of the seminal strategy games of the 16-bit era. Despite its dated graphics and identical gameplay, Nectaris is a solid game nonetheless and worth a look from those interested in some mellow blasting or for those that haven't played the first game. With Nectaris out, all we need now is an update of Herzog Zwei. --Peter Bartholow <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

This cumbersome interface is evident throughout the program, making it also hard to work with the planner and diary.<P>The calendar is the best component, letting you double click on a date for direct access to the corresponding journal entry, for instance. The writing space found in the journal is too limited for long-winded writers, and the same seven questions (e.g., ""Pick a line from a song that best describes your day"") appear for every journal entry. Testers never did figure out how to get the planner to work, and we couldn\'t find a way to import or export info from other files containing names and addresses.

Monster Truck Madness,,['19 licensed monster trucks. 10 tracks. 5 playing modes including 2 modes for 4 players. Variety of power-ups. Weather and lighting conditions change.'],[],{},"[""Imagine sitting in the driver's seat of the meanest, baddest, mega-sized trucks on the road. A round up of 20 different world-renowned monster trucks and 10 huge tracks, each with a special theme, keep things interesting. Weather conditions and daylight are under your control, and the challenging play control mimics actual driving conditions using a real-world physics model."", 'Playing Monster Truck Madness 64 is like driving a lemon: You really want to get somewhere with it, but something\'s sure to break down along the way. After checking under this game\'s hood, it\'s easy to pinpoint the problems: frustrating control, questionable gameplay, and subpar graphics and features. Despite some fairly creative extras, this title screams for six more months in the tune-up shop before hitting the streets. Monster Truck Madness is essentially an arcade off-road racing game. However, instead of rally cars, the game employs 20 huge trucks with balloon tires. The trucks compete on fictional tracks littered with weapons to pick up, such as oil slicks and missiles. Placing first on a track unlocks additional tracks (up to ten total, depending on the difficulty level). The tracks are designed with plenty of jumps and hills, which makes for some fairly rough-and-tumble racing. <P>At least, that\'s what you would expect - until you pick up the controller. For those who\'ve enjoyed off-road arcade racers such as Sega Rally Championship, this game hardly measures up to those standards. A key factor in off-road games is the ability to powerslide: After braking into a turn to point sideways, you can feather the acceleration button to keep your speed as you slide through. One would figure that with heavier trucks and bigger tires, this would be possible to some extent. Sadly, the game\'s control can\'t mimic that ""feel"" accurately. When you brake into a turn to initiate a powerslide, the truck stops abruptly rather than sliding in the mud - it won\'t carry your momentum. However, if you merely try to turn early and feather the acceleration through a turn, the truck becomes an ice skate and you overshoot the turn. The physics between the two scenarios don\'t match up - stop on mud one way, but slide the other - which makes powersliding difficult. Instead, you wind up driving slowly through turns, which lets computer trucks catch up. <P>Compounding that control problem is questionable gameplay. When trucks jostle for position, it\'s easy to get caught sideways. That\'s the kiss of death, because a broadside collision can send you literally flying off the track. However, the same doesn\'t apply to computer trucks: They merely block you from moving ahead. In addition, when collisions cause your truck to tip over, the animation occurs in excruciatingly slow motion, which gives extra time for computer trucks to rush ahead. The same goes if you run down a slope, as the truck tips over at the same slow-motion speed whether you hit it at five or 50 miles per hour. The game doesn\'t even have the decency to face you forward again after a flip - you have to do it yourself. Plus, the computer seems to relish nudging you into obstacles that stop trucks dead in their tracks, such as pillars or checkpoints, which can easily knock you out of contention. <P>Presumably, the power-ups are the key to even the odds stacked against you. Problem is, half the power-ups help opponents more than they hurt them. Turbos and superjump power-ups often send you off track or force you to flip over. A force-field power-up, intended to knock players off track, often sends them flying ahead of you rather than off to the side. Since you must race flawlessly to finish first (at the normal difficulty), one mistake means you\'re better off restarting the race than trying to finish - that gets lame very quickly. <P>Graphically, the game sports first-generation textures and graphics, which look drab and plain by today\'s standards - at least the game adds nice touches when it comes to weather effects, such as fog or snow. What hurts the game\'s looks more than the graphics is the game\'s speed. The speedometer may read 100-plus miles per hour, but the trucks move as if grannies are behind the wheels, so there\'s no ""rush"" because the trucks seem to move so slow. As for the sound, a grating announcer serves up inane, smart-ass comments that make you glad he can be turned off - and wish he could be run over by a truck. The background rock music and effects aren\'t anything special, either. <P>The laundry list of complaints continues with one sorely missing feature: no memory card support. Instead, you must type out tedious 8- to 17-character sequences that must be reentered every time you quit a game. <P>To its credit, the game sports some decent innovations. First off, the tracks are free roaming, so a truck can go off course any time to find a shortcut or a power-up. Second, the trucks in the game are based on famous real-life vehicles, such as Big Foot and Grave Digger - but despite this variety, all trucks seem to handle the same for the most part. Finally, the game has some fairly interesting multiplayer minigames, such as hockey, soccer, and a monster-truck variant of king of the hill. Unfortunately, one has to accept the game\'s control and gameplay flaws to enjoy them. <P>When one adds it all up, Monster Truck Madness winds up as barely playable and hardly fun. Gamers itchin\' for a monster-truck fix should save their cash until the real thing rolls into town. --Nelson Taruc <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

There are more than a dozen possible endings to the game, and while you may beat Silent Hill without a strong sense of the events you've lived through, you can finish Clock Tower II several times and still have absolutely no idea what had happened at all. And the interface and gameplay will keep you from wanting to continually go back and find out."", ""The game screams for Resident Evil-like control of your character, but you're left with the archaic point-and-click setup that's slow to acknowledge your commands, occasionally misconstrues them, and sometimes won't accept them for unexplained reasons. According to your character's response, your directional commands are often misinterpreted for another location in the room, something that can cause you to get killed if an assailant is chasing you. Events are often triggered only after you've significantly looked around, and then eventually the game lets you enter new rooms or open drawers in unrelated areas. It seems like an arbitrary way to solve puzzles, and one that doesn't force you to think, but to spend quantifiable time wandering around areas you've been before, pointing and clicking until you can go on. It's like being stuck on a Rubik's Cube, going into the next room, turning on the TV, and coming back later to find the cube solved. It makes sense that your other personality looks at the world differently and can access different areas, but many of the puzzles are simply counterintuitive."", 'The graphics in Clock Tower II are pure first-generation PlayStation. The character models are so aged-looking that they creak, and their movements are likewise clunky and wooden. The rooms are also sparsely decorated, and loading times rule the day. The music and sound effects are similarly poor, occurring only during tense moments. The translation is much like that found in the original Resident Evil, except without the charmingly camp moments. Instead of, ""You were almost a Jill sandwich"" or ""You, the master of unlocking,"" you get reactions to appliances like washers and refrigerators in the tone of, ""Wow, it\'s full."" A strange noise? ""What!"" A disembodied limb? ""Only a leg!"" And so on.', ""Clock Tower II isn't a good choice for those looking for a solid puzzle adventure or a compelling and scary game - it's neither smart, nor frightening, nor fun.

Series cocreator John Tobias reports that the gameplay should play out at about 50 percent fighting and 50 percent exploration/puzzle solving. The game will be seen from a third-person perspective with a camera described as being closer to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time than Tomb Raider. Specifically, it\'s one that will eventually move into place behind the character, while a controller button will also be dedicated to knocking it into place. Additionally, a look function will allow you to see out of the character\'s eyes so you can scan your environment for objects and clues. Currently, the fighting system is set so that three enemies can surround you at once, but the actual fighting will remain one-on-one until you knock a Kombatant away. Enemy targeting is being handled in such a way that if an opponent is in the general vicinity, you can initiate a spin attack that will turn you to face your foe, even if the enemy is approaching from behind.  <P>MK: SF is said to have a single ending, but will there will be multiple paths for each character to get there? ""The way we\'re handling that is that whenever they\'re on a mission, they split up or get separated,"" says Tobias. ""Sometimes they don\'t intentionally split up; something happens and they both have to go separate ways, and towards the end of the level they come back together. Depending upon who you play, what you do see, the enemies you face, and the story even to some extent will be different. You travel through the same levels but there are different paths [on each] and it will seem like a different game."" <P>As for other noteworthy facts, the story cinemas will be displayed using the in-game engine (a la Metal Gear Solid and the N64 version of Mortal Kombat 4) instead of through FMV, Kerri (Sonya) Hoskins and Rich (Kano) Divizio will be providing audio and motion capture for the title, and fluid character animations have been promised. <P>Finally, the question that begs to be asked is: Why isn\'t the game being called Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Special Forces, in line with the previous Mortal Kombat side story, Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero? ""We left the Mythologies off the title simply because the title was getting way too long,"" Tobias remarks, laughing. ""We tried to slim it down to get the point across so that the fans know what the game is about without having a whole mouth full of alphabet to spew out.""  <P>With that in mind, videogames.com editors tried an early  version of the game at E3 this year, where the game was officially unveiled. Here\'s what Jeff Greeson thought: <P>Combining elements of role-playing and puzzle solving, MK: Special Forces offers a new platform for the Mortal Kombat series, while retaining the intense fighting action that fans have to come expect. The game offers a Tomb Raider style of play along with the fighting style of Mortal Kombat 4. Midway wants to keep both the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation versions of the game similar to each other, opting to go with real-time animated sequences, in opposed to full motion video. The textures on the Nintendo 64 seemed smoother, while the PlayStation offered superior audio. <P>The first level in the game places your character in realistic environments in order to familiarize new players with the surrounding environments. The level requires your character to run around and find keys to open doors and elevators in order to complete your mission objective. While running around the level, you receive messages from other Special Forces members informing you with clues and new objectives. As you get further into the game, the missions become more elaborate and the environments become more surreal. Depending on which player your choose and how events unfold during that level, the story\'s path can change dramatically, providing the game with extensive replay value. <P>Your character can perform special fighting moves, like Sonya\'s patented handstand leg grab, by holding down one of the shoulder buttons while pressing one of the standard punch or kick buttons. In addition to standard hand to hand fighting, you can equip your character with 9mm pistols, machine guns and other weapons from an inventory system. Also, the controls offer a targeting button that switches your character\'s focus towards another opponent if multiple enemies approach you. Finally, there is a camera button that changes the camera view to right behind your character, incase the camera gets placed in an awkward angle. <P>Videogames.com\'s reviews editor, Jeff Gerstmann also tried out the game: While not my favorite Mortal Kombat characters, Jax and Sonya definitely make a great team. Special Forces puts them into a game that, at this point, could be described as Tomb Raider meets Fighting Force. The gameplay and fighting system mostly consists of pounding on the punch and kick buttons, though there\'s some jumping around and gunplay thrown in for good measure. The camera is a little iffy at this point, but it\'s nothing that can\'t be fixed. The game looks really nice and runs at a pretty good framerate.  --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Chopper Attack,,['Nintendo 64 game'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"[""The basic formula of helicopter games has always been to blow up stuff, rescue hostages, and try not to get blown up in the process. It's worked since the days of Choplifter, and it still applies today. Chopper Attack follows this description to the letter, playing a bit like Soviet Strike with Blast Corps-style graphics. <P>Seta developed Wild Choppers as an action/shooter that allows you to pilot one of eight attack choppers. Each chopper has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it is a good idea to try them all out to see which one suits your playing style. As you play, you earn money to buy various missiles and bombs to help eradicate enemy forces throughout the missions. The missions range from blowing up everything in the area to guarding a jumbo jet as it flies through enemy air space. Each area is filled with scores of hostile aircraft, terrorizing tanks, and artillery that try to blow you out of the sky. Some levels are huge wide-open spaces that let you roam freely from one target to the next, while other areas have you deep within a narrow canyon, and you are forced to go through scores of enemy divisions. On some missions there are giant bosses such as giant planes, helicopters, and hovercrafts.  <P>The controls in Chopper Attack are a little touchy at first, but once you get the hang of it, they're actually quite nice. To move and aim the helicopter, use the analog stick. The buttons are used to fire weapons and to strafe. Any music that annoys you is a bad thing. The music was rocking at first, but after a week I was much happier with the sound off. The explosions and all of the other sound effects are great, and when using the rumble pack they really give you the panicky sensation of being shot at.  <P>The only other problem with the game is that I felt kind of boxed in at times because I couldn't control my elevation. Your chopper is set at a constant elevation, unless you go up the side of a mountain, in which case your chopper just goes up the side of it. This would be a bigger issue if the game were a little more sim-based, but it is still a little disappointing. <P>Chopper Attack is a fair N64 game. It's fast, fun, and pretty exciting. It is, however, a short game, so you may just want to rent the game and finish it rather than picking up your own copy. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

World Driver Championship,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<I>World Driver: Championship</I> balances possibly the best graphics ever seen in an auto racing game for the Nintendo 64 with some of the toughest gameplay in its genre. This is a game for the committed auto racing video game enthusiast, requiring enormous concentration, dedication, and lots of patience. In other words, those with a short attention span or a tendency to get frustrated may want to steer clear.', 'Four traditional modes of play are offered: quick race, training, championship, and two-player. In championship mode, players join a team, choose one of the initially few available cars, and then compete in 10 track events. Ranking in the top of the pack earns career points, opening new events and allowing players to upgrade cars and even switch to more experienced teams.', 'This is one tough game, focusing on realism from nearly every aspect. The first few accessible cars are very difficult to handle, and one spinout or crash can end all chances of finishing out of last place. Very frustrating, but also very compelling, as practice finds one learning subtleties that soon find racers bumper-to-bumper with the lead pack. The cars handle quite realistically and, with practice, skidding perfectly into turns around city blocks becomes an art form.', ""The graphics reign supreme, leaving players stunned even before they discover the letterboxed, high-resolution mode. One downside is that with so much realism in the game, bumping off walls without incurring car damage is not quite right. We'd love to see a simulation option that fully takes advantage of the even greater realism this game's powerful engine could offer. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", ""<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Challenging gameplay keeps getting better--for those with patience</li> <li>Superior graphics</li> <li>In-depth championship mode</li> <li>Nice replay feature with multiple camera angles</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Massive learning curve; difficult to progress</li> <li>Car damage nonexistent and collisions too arcade-like</li> <li>The track sure is a lonely place when you're well behind the pack</li> </ul>"", ""World Driver Championship is yet another racing game from Boss Game Studios, the company that brought you Top Gear Rally. WDC is a racing game that features exceptional graphics - some are calling it Gran Turismo for the N64. While this comparison may be true in the graphics department, the rest of the game can only be called mediocre. <P>World Driver has four modes of play: quick race, championship, versus, and training. The game doesn't carry any official license for the cars or tracks, but that apparently didn't stop the designers from making cars that are identical in all but name to some very famous real cars. In all, there are more than thirty cars that you can unlock by progressing through the game, which has ten tracks in various locations around the world, such as Hawaii, New Zealand, and Rome. Each track has three variations and can be raced in either direction. Boss must be using the new math, because it claims that the game has more than 100 track experiences. While that may be true in the literal sense, the game really only has ten different types of tracks, with lots of very slight variations. As you compete and do better in the game, you'll get job offers from other teams that want to hire you as the driver. There are 15 teams in all that you can drive for, each of which has different cars that all perform differently. Some cars have better handling and acceleration, while others may have higher top speeds. Even though the cars have strengths in different areas, they all suffer from one major control problem. Every car controls as if it's on an icy stretch of road. For example, just about every time you come around a corner, the back end of your car slides out from underneath it. At times it gets a little ridiculous, like when you're racing a track that has three turns in a row. Your car starts sliding into the first turn, and then, if you just point it in the right direction it magically slides around the rest of the turns. This type of slippery car physics makes the gameplay a little unrealistic and frustrating, mostly because you're always riding the brake or slamming into a wall. If you're a fan of Ridge Racer-style physics, this is, of course, a good thing. <P>Graphically, World Driver Championship is quite beautiful. All the cars and tracks look very convincing. The game has normal and hi-res letterbox modes that don't require the expansion pak. In either mode, the game has a very crisp, clean look to it. As most N64 racing-game fans know, racing games on the N64 usually suffer from one of two things: pop-up or fog. World Driver, however, is one of the system's first racing games to have a minimal amount of each. This was accomplished by using strategically designed tracks that help hide the track building pretty well. These cleverly designed tracks also allow the game to have up to eight vehicles onscreen at one time, although when this happens the otherwise constant frame rate does falter. <P>The music in the game is of the glam-rock type - lots of cheesy repetitive guitar licks and lots of bass and snare drums clashing over and over again. I'll take a plain, nondescript techno beat over an annoyingly repetitive rock ditty any day. The one good thing about the music is that it can be turned off. When off, you can here all the authentic engine sounds - that is, when you listen carefully over the constantly squealing tires. <P>In the end, World Driver Championship is an average racing game with exceptional graphics. The game's incredible visuals give you a sense of realism for a little while, but the second your car starts to do an excessive slide around a turn, it kind of falls apart. The game also never really gives you the sensation of the speed at which your car is traveling, even later in the game when you have cars that can really move. The speedometer tells you that you're doing 120 MPH, but it feels more like you're going 60. While World Driver isn't a bad game, it is a questionable buy. It's definitely worth renting. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Rampart,,['For the Game Boy Color'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Game Boy Color', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<I>Rampart</I> is an arcade classic that, unfortunately, doesn't come across well on the Game Boy Color. The object of the game is to take over castles by encasing them with circular walls. You will also need to defend your possessions by firing cannons at invaders. Each combat phase is followed by a rebuilding phase. As you catch more castles, you are able to accumulate more cannons to help you better fend off the ever-increasing foes.

Army Men - GameBoy Color,,"['One player only', 'overhead perspective', 'more than 20 missions', 'variety of environments', 'wide array of weapons']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Game Boy Color', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Childhood imagination and real-world environments combine to bring to life tactical combat action in <i>Army Men</i>. Command Sarge and his troops in a battle against the Tan Army--sneak behind enemy lines, rescue POWs, secure enemy war plans, and eliminate Tan adversaries across varied terrain. Pick up a variety of destructive weapons and drive high-powered military vehicles to complete your mission objectives. Enlist now!', 'Were you to peer into the toy chests of American children circa 1970 or 1980, you were apt to find huge collections of green plastic soldiers. Colloquially known as ""army men,"" these plastic soldiers didn\'t articulate, they had no accessories, and they kept their valiant poses as if one wavering moment could bring an opposing army down on top of them. Knowing that nostalgia and competitive instincts never die, the 3DO company has resurrected the phenomenon for today\'s audiences with its Army Men series of games, which now includes a Game Boy Color release. Though it requires a stretch of the imagination, Army Men puts you in control of Sarge, the Green army\'s elite warrior of virtue. As orders come down, you\'ll be asked to traverse two huge areas and 28 unique missions, all from a top-down Zelda-reminiscent perspective. Unfortunately, the Tan army is well equipped, and you\'re vastly outnumbered, but a wide array of weapons and power-ups are available to help even the score. Whether you choose to make do with your trusty rifle, move up to the destructive bazooka, or play a game of catch with grenades, the game\'s seven unique armaments make blowing up plastic soldiers almost as fun as when you were a kid. Though Sarge\'s sluggish response takes time to get used to, the airtight control found in the weapons system redeems this minor flaw. While it can be murder to adjust to a proper angle for targeting an enemy, shots leap out of the muzzle with a tap of the A button and strike their mark with satisfying accuracy. Additionally, switching between weapons is as easy as tapping the B button, providing instant access to whatever devastation you choose to unleash. If you were ever a fan of run and shoot games like Ikari Warriors or Commando, the gameplay is going to seem comfortably familiar. In addition to that, the story is entertaining as well. Bringing out all the fatty-boom-batty fake war action, the game\'s visuals are a mixture of detailed terrain, expressive characters, and bone-crunchingly vicious explosions. Sarge runs along as if he were painstakingly rotoscoped, enemies patrol with nerve-wracking patience and vehicles move about in a realistically weighty fashion. If anything negative is to be said for Army Men\'s graphics, it\'s that too few colors were used to express them. There\'s also a distinct point at which sprite repetition becomes a fatigue-inducing factor, but this aspect is tempered by quick levels and intelligent use of the password feature. Though no one is going to call Army Men\'s visuals perfect, what you see is more than sufficiently rendered, while the gameplay and engrossing quest help further minimize the graphical flaws. More so than the visuals, Army Men\'s sound quality is deceptively good. Digitized sounds flesh out Sarge\'s character and help pull gamers into the game, while weapon sounds, explosions, and other requisite effects perform their jobs adequately, never sounding tinny or garbled. At first listen, even the background music is excellent. After a few minutes though, the illusion of perfection falls apart. There\'s only one music track during the entire game - one! That\'s a solitary single track if you\'re keeping count. Other than this single glaring flaw, nothing else about Army Men\'s audio is disappointing. Unfortunately, it\'s hard to overlook something you\'ll hear constantly during the few hours or so it takes to beat the game. Taken as a whole, Army Men is an enjoyable game that delivers the pleasingly nostalgic experience of plastic-soldier warfare. While it has a variety of minor flaws, nothing really derails the game\'s overall experience, and the plot is certainly worth investing a few hours in. But the unfortunate lack of secrets, combined with already repetitious gameplay though, does decrease the game\'s overall replay value. But even given this, Army Men is a darn fine game that delivers much pleasure while it lasts.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

This time around, Midway has packaged up a bunch of mid-\'80s Atari games. Atari Collection 2 contains Paperboy, Roadblasters, Crystal Castles, Marble Madness, Millipede, and Gauntlet. <P>While many of the games are identical emulations, meaning they use the same code as the original arcade versions, Gauntlet and Paperboy are ports, meaning the original coin-op code was converted over. The ports are pretty good, although there are a few spots where you can notice the difference. Gauntlet supports the multitap, so four players can play. Analog control is supported in Paperboy, Roadblasters, Crystal Castles, and Marble Madness. It works reasonably well, but is a bit too touchy at times. Crystal Castles and Marble Madness simply demand a trackball - no other controller will do. <P>The graphics are what you\'d expect from games of that era, but everything looks more than a little fuzzy. Paperboy is the fuzziest of the bunch, and also has some weird contrast problems going on. The sound is about the same, but there is some weirdness here, too. Gauntlet occasionally forgets to make the key pickup noise, and the character-specific speech, ""Warrior...now has...extra shot power,"" is even slower than normal. <P>Without trackballs, Marble Madness and Crystal Castles aren\'t much fun. Without a steering wheel, Roadblasters suffers. Without the crazy handlebars, Paperboy isn\'t nearly as good. Gauntlet and Millipede control reasonably well, but Gauntlet just seems strange and doesn\'t hold up as well as I thought it would. <P>And that\'s perhaps the largest problem with this collection. The games just don\'t hold up as well to the tests of time as the previous collections. There\'s just something eerily wrong with the games, like all the fun got sucked out, and blurry, poor-controlling husks were all that remained. Get it for Gauntlet, if you\'re a fan. Otherwise, you\'re still better off tracking down the arcade versions of these games. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Mortal Kombat 4,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Game Boy Color', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""While all four of the Mortal Kombat games have been released on Nintendo's portable platform, none of them have been terribly faithful re-creations of the arcade games on which they are based. I mean, let's face it: It's hard to take all those digitized graphics and toss them onto the Game Boy. Tossing the 3D environment of the fourth game would be nearly impossible. So MK4 on the GB is a strictly 2D affair. Many of the original game's characters have been stripped out, and the move count has been greatly reduced. Much like the other MK games on the Game Boy, the controls aren't very responsive. Special moves are a chore to pull off. The game's fatalities are done a bit differently than the fatalities in the previous games. When you perform the move, the game cuts away to a short, grainy animation, presumably digitized from the arcade version. It's a nice, quirky touch that brings a little charm to an otherwise uneventful game. People looking for portable fighting-game action would do well to wait for Street Fighter Alpha, a much more responsive fighting game.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Assault: Retribution,,['FANTASTIC GAME'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['What does one have to do to get a good game of Contra around here? Midway\'s Assault: Retribution is a poor excuse for an action game, falling into innumerable design pitfalls that were supposed to have been filled long ago. <P>Konami\'s taken a lot of flak for the two Contra rip-offs its American office licensed to Hungarian developer Appaloosa. Assault: Retribution is just as miserable, if not more so, and doesn\'t even have the ""Hey, this isn\'t Contra!"" disappointment factor to amplify the game\'s flaws. You select one of two characters at the beginning of the game, each of which has four different guns at his disposal, gained by picking up the weapon power-up icons in the game. You have 100 hit points and a bank of energy to power your weapons. In addition to weapon power-ups, you can collect up to three orbiting weapon upgrades for each of your guns, weapon batteries, medical kits, and some kind of electric-spasm smart bomb equivalent. If your weapon battery or life bars are full, you can actually store a battery or medical kit for later use, an uncharacteristic bit of innovation. The gameplay is virtually identical to the two Contra games on the PlayStation: You blast everything from a mostly overhead point of view in a full 3D world. You can also angle your gun up or down using the controller\'s right shoulder buttons, but this is rarely required and more trouble than it\'s worth the rest of the time. A la Crash Bandicoot, Assault has a few forced-scroll levels in it, among them a Chain Reaction-inspired ""outrun the nuclear blast on foot"" scene and a generic hoverbike scenario. Unlike the PlayStation\'s Contra games, Assault includes two-player simultaneous play, an effort that could have been laudable had it been executed better. <P>While the basics may sound playable enough, Assault\'s problems are almost too many to list in this review. Like virtually every other 3D game that\'s tried to accomplish this sort of thing, shooting and judging distances in Assault are more difficult than they should be. A number of bosses seem to rely on this flaw, annoyingly hiding their weak spots from you. Due to the game\'s problems with aiming and the like, the developers have made it virtually impossible to die at the hands of the game\'s enemies on the default difficulty level. Regardless of how many enemies are on the screen, you shouldn\'t need to use any kind of strategy at all - running into the enemies while holding the fire button seems to work fine a majority of the time. As a result, annoying artifacts of the game\'s poor design manifest as the game\'s difficulty level increases- annoying jumps and poor control or camera issues will represent a majority of the players\' deaths. Without these, just about anyone could complete Assault: Retribution in his first sitting. While cool-sounding on paper, the game\'s weapon system is flawed and annoying. After depleting a battery, you automatically switch to your primary weapon. While this saves one of the better weapons from certain death should you die, the lack of energy to power the weapon cripples you. The only way to rectify this situation is to run around and dodge enemies as best the current camera angle will allow while you wait for the battery to recharge. Finally, Assault gets a few brownie points for its two-player simultaneous gameplay. However, the game\'s technology seriously gets in the way in this case - the game can\'t handle two players without massive frame rate loss. A single player is likely to get farther than the team, as aiming and movement are much easier when the game\'s running at normal speed. Remember all of those places in Contra where you\'d kill your friends, accidentally or otherwise, because the screen wouldn\'t scroll without you? They\'re back, and more annoying than ever - to prevent this from happening, the players need to be close to each other at all times. <P>Aesthetically, Assault is a mess. While the game\'s locales are constantly changing in style and appearance, they still fail to look good most of the time. The game\'s textures and geometry are chunky and unappealing, all while operating under a less-than-acceptable frame rate for this type of game. From the color palette to the models themselves, Assault looks like a first-generation PlayStation game. The game\'s music is over-synthed Euro-popish techno drivel, with the one redeeming factor of decently masking the game\'s extremely repetitive grunts and alien shrieks. <P>Lots of bad games are made every year, but not all of them get inexplicably picked up by generally well-respected publishers. Midway obviously dropped the ball when negotiating for this title - here\'s to hoping it learns from its mistake. --Peter Bartholow <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

PERFECT &amp; CLEAN.', ""The original Army Men was a decent game, though it didn't quite live up to many gamers' expectations. Awkward controls, dated graphics, and (on some missions) surprisingly difficult objectives detracted from the unquestionable allure of pitting those little plastic guys against one another. With Army Men II, 3DO seems to have corrected a number of the original game's issues. The problem is, Army Men II fails to cash in on its solid premise and ends up feeling more like a version 1.1 release than a full-fledged sequel."", 'As the game begins, a beautifully rendered scene sets the stage for the action: Green troops stumble across a pan-dimensional teleporter that transports them to a strange world (ours). Tan troops follow them through the portal, and a firefight breaks out on a kitchen countertop far, far away. If only the game continued on like this...', 'After an all-too-brief opening mission in which you must guide your troops past roaches and electric stovetops, you all get teleported back to the world of Army Men - where you will find yourself for most of the game. Every once in a while, you\'ll get another mission back in our world, but these pop up far too infrequently. Worse yet, not a single one of the maps from the ""real world"" missions is available during multiplayer games. What 3DO was thinking here, I honestly cannot fathom.', ""Gameplay is essentially the same as in the original game. Again, you command Sarge, a hard-nosed soldier who can not only handle every weapon known to man but also drive any manner of military vehicle (including PT Boats). You view the action from a top-down perspective and guide Sarge using the keyboard and/or the mouse. The default keys take some getting used to, but you can remap them. Mouse control is sufficient most of the time, but it's not as intuitive as what you'd find in a good real-time strategy game. In case you're wondering, your troops follow your lead around the map unless you select and assign them specific orders."", 'You can also order specific units or groups of units to attack, defend, hold position, or rally around you. Additionally, you can now save your game at any point during a mission, which is nice because some of the missions have several stages. Perhaps the best new feature, however, is the addition of experience ratings for your troops. Each solider under your command gets a little more proficient with each mission he survives. In other words, it is in your best interests to keep these boys alive for as long as possible.', 'Other new things to look out for: The game now offers a few new weapons, including the super-cool magnifying glass, an M80 (woo hoo!), and an aerosol can that can be used with lighters to do lots of wonderful damage. Sarge also gets to tote around a sniper rifle, which is perhaps the best weapon in the game.', 'Army Men II seems quite a bit more forgiving than the original, with well-stepped difficulty levels that let players of any skill level move through the game. Most missions are well designed, with interesting (and often familiar) objectives and settings. There are a handful of missions that seem to have just one too many objectives - you know, the type that just never seem to end - but the rest are well thought-out and fairly challenging.', ""Of course, the horrendous pathfinding adds considerably to the challenge. Your units simply can't find their way out of a foxhole, which means that you must guide them around the maps using baby-step destination points (click a little ahead, click just a little farther ahead, and so on). This proves to be extremely aggravating, especially on missions where time is a factor. Also, the pathfinding is at its absolute worst when controlling the PT Boat. Not only can the AI not find a simple path through the water (the wide-open water, mind you) but the game keeps jerking the camera angle back to center on the boat, even when I wanted to scan around for hostiles."", 'The soundtrack deserves mention. The music is a collection of classical pieces that at times fits the situation and at others seems terribly out of place. The cutscenes, on the other hand, are fantastic and for the most part funny (especially the scene that plays when you fail a mission).', ""Multiplayer support is strong, letting up to four players compete over IPX or TCP/IP connections. Head-to-head play over serial and modem links is also supported. Army Men II provides a good skirmish mode - one in which you can actually beat the computer - and also lets you fill in empty slots in a multiplayer game with AI opponents. The setup screen for multiplayer games is slick, but the selection of maps for these games is pretty weak. Where's that cool kitchen countertop map?"", ""Overall, Army Men II is fun, but it's just not all that it could be (apologies for the weak Army joke...). Let's hope 3DO will patch the AI and the pathfinding and make some of those real-world maps available for multiplayer games. Until then, you'll probably only really like this one if you're already a big fan of the original. <i>--Michael E. Ryan</i> <br /><i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Die Hard Trilogy 2,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Vegas, baby, Vegas! Action game fans will want to gamble on the latest action-packed  installment of the popular <i>Die Hard</i> series. While the Amazon.com editorial team has not yet had a  chance to fully review the much-hyped <i>Die Hard Trilogy 2: Viva Las Vegas</i>, we're intrigued by Fox  Interactive's promise of varied gameplay and fast-action fun. <i>Die Hard Trilogy 2: Viva Las Vegas</i>  aims to please with diverse game segments that test your driving, shooting, or action-adventure gaming  skills."", ""<I>Die Hard Trilogy 2: Viva Las Vegas</I> also boasts enemies that respond intelligently to your  aim-and-fire assault. Enemies retaliate carefully against attacks instead of walking carelessly into your  gunfire. They also pursue and attack aggressively, rather than randomly. We're hoping that <I>Die Hard  Trilogy 2: Viva Las Vegas</I> is worth the gamble."", 'Die Hard Trilogy 2 only seems like an incredibly strange name for a game until you stop to think about how obvious it is for a developer to want to make a sequel to one of the best titles to have appeared on the PlayStation. In it, you\'re once again placed in the shoes of Bruce Willis\' same-named film character John McClane as he takes on another group of ""terrorists from another country."" How can the same thing happen to the same guy four times? Bad luck or sequelitis, you decide.  As the original was, DHT2 is three games in one: a third-person shooter, a gun game, and an ""extreme driving game."" This time, however, you can play through each of these sections separately or through a story mode, which strings them along in an order somewhat resembling a plot. In other words, you can play a gun level and then go to a driving level before coming back to another gun level. The third-person levels follow McClane as he blasts his way through criminal hordes using machine guns, shotguns, and stun guns, saving the occasional hostage along the way. These stages are very similar to the third-person levels from the first Die Hard Trilogy, even if they aren\'t nearly as long or difficult. They even look much like those stages, albeit strained through n-Space\'s Duke Nukem: Time to Kill engine, and you view them from a perspective slightly closer to the ground.  The gun-game stage runs along the same lines as before. You\'re transported through various environments on rails like those of an amusement-park ride, and you must shoot terrorists who pop out at you while at the same time avoid firing on innocents who happen to get in the way. Instances where enemies appear on opposite ends of the screen at once are much more rare in this version, and you seem to have more time to shoot before being shot. Graphically, it\'s a more cluttered redux of the similar section from the last game. Since the original came out more than three years ago, it looks somewhat dated, although not enough to overly impinge on the gameplay. This stage supports the Konami light gun well, while the GunCon peripheral doesn\'t seem quite as accurate as it does in Namco\'s own titles.  The least appealing section of Die Hard Trilogy 2 is the driving stage, in which you race around town smashing into enemy cars and running over bombs. Though the stage isn\'t awful, the car doesn\'t handle as tightly as it should, and the entire experience is simply not that much fun to play. If you\'re working through the story mode, you\'ll look forward to finishing the driving levels so you can get back to the other stages, which can be fairly entertaining at times. The level of difficulty is toned down a notch from the first DHT in all three sections, yet the game is still fairly challenging. Sure, it\'s got some knocks against it. The graphics aren\'t exactly first rate, the soundtrack is made up of that metallic sort of canned techno that turns people off to electronic music, and the voice-acting calls to mind amateur impersonation night at the local improv. But it somehow retains a certain degree of playable charm.  While it doesn\'t stack up well when compared with the original game, Die Hard Trilogy 2 does manage to outclass recent like-minded titles like EA\'s Tomorrow Never Dies, and it provides a nice fix for those who own PlayStation light guns. It may be a better rental than a purchase, but those not expecting a lot out of the game may find themselves pleasantly surprised.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

R/C Stunt Copter,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Now anyone with a PlayStation can dive into the hobby of  radio-controlled helicopter flying without the enormous financial cost or the  risk of crashing as you learn to fly. <I>R/C Stunt Copter</I>, believe  it or not, is an absolutely enthralling and entertaining game.', ""Wisely, the game integrates a training mode as a must-play starter  course before advancing to the mission-based aerial challenges.  However, don't expect to snooze your way through the missions: the  dynamic vocal host spouts out plenty of snide and witty remarks to keep  gamers on their toes. Also, excellent carnival-like music accompanies  each bit of the game, including menu screens, training levels, and  various gaming segments. Extremely touchy controls emulate the real  thing, while the game provides words of encouragement to help you  master dangerous stunts such as loops, rolls, and even inverted flight.  With rich gameplay and helpful flying tips, this game achieves the rare  feat of teaching while it entertains. A must-own! <i>--Jeff  Young</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b><br> <ul> <li>Outstanding presentation makes for a mix of learning and fun <li>Superb physics model and controls give the feeling of really  controlling a tiny copter <li>Extremely challenging levels will keep players coming back for more </ul>', '<b>Cons:</b><br> <ul> <li>The concentration required may be too frustrating for younger  players </ul>', 'Shiny\'s RC Stunt Copter is an inexpensive alternative to the particularly pricey and incredibly fragile device known as the radio-controlled copter. The learning curve for controlling both the real-life and virtual copters is very steep, but the latter provides an endless supply of replacements at no additional cost, as well as an extended tutorial.  Your instruction begins with ten stages, where you learn how to land your copter, sharp shoot, and other basic functions, all of which you\'ll learn on a ship with training skids that keep you from crashing. The better you do in the training levels, the more copters you open up for the single-player game. The rookie copter is the machine you use during the training levels (complete with an auto leveling function). The next level\'s pilot ship doesn\'t have the auto level but does have the training skids, and the captain class doesn\'t have the training skids or the auto level. The ace has the stunt-ride feature, which enables you to fly the copter upside down.  The single-player game comprises six levels made up of five stages each. The stages test your skills in the areas of hovering, shooting, landing, slalom, and targeting (playing through structures), with each consecutive stage being more difficult than the last. For instance, the slalom stage in the first level requires you to fly back and forth through two goal posts in a football field, while in a later slalom challenge you must navigate above or below a series of hurdles. Likewise, in an earlier landing stage, you\'ll have to set down on three consecutive landing pads. Eventually, you\'ll have to accomplish this while the pads are moving.  Playing through using the rookie copter will prepare you well to fly pilot class, while the captain class (in which you must perform complex stunts as well as fulfill each stage\'s general requirements) will take some time to master and the ace class, even more. So the single-player game is essentially one long training experience for flying this impossibly delicate machine. In the two-player mode, you and your opponents face the same challenges of the single-player game. In a nice break from the norm, the noncompeting player can try to make his opponent crash by placing a large polygonal hand on the screen, blocking his opponent\'s view. The extended learning curve severely limits the number of people you can get to play against you in this mode, but once a few are prepped and up to speed, RC Stunt Copter is one of the best drinking games since Virgin Interactive\'s never-released fighter Thrill Kill.  And since drinking games usually have a humorous tie-in, it only makes sense that the game is peppered with smart-alecky lines delivered from a male narrator (who, oddly enough, sometimes sounds like the hippie teacher from Beavis & Butt-Head). These lines are often funny, and they\'re bearable because they\'re not repeated too often. The sheer number of unique comments is actually very impressive. Unlike in most sports games that have ""color commentary,"" there are so many lines in RC Stunt you can play it for hours without hearing all of them. The music is pretty sparse, but the other sound effects get the job done.  Graphically, the game is slightly above average, with a camera that does what it should most of the time - it sticks behind the copter until you get close to the stage\'s visual boundaries. At that point, the camera changes so that you are either facing your own ship head-on or viewing it from the side, which is very disorienting though true to the real-life experience. Going beyond the camera\'s capabilities, the controls in RC are fantastic. You\'ll be amazed with some of the stunts you can pull off after spending a lot of time with the game. There\'s a lot of value in the single-player mode because the control is so good. (we\'re talking about the analog controller here, folks). Also, the two-player competition makes up for the fact that you\'re repeating the same levels with different copters. Altogether, RC is a genre-bending title that\'s well worth checking out.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

So the arrival of Monaco Grand Prix begs the question: Why does the world need another F-1 simulation? The answers is a simple: Why not? The game has superb graphics, strong control, and an attention to realism that racing gearheads will appreciate. It's hard for any F-1 game - this one included - to stand apart from the pack, since most games are bound by the conventions of the sport. It boasts 16 world tracks built to-scale, including Monaco, and every singleone looks unique, picture-perfect, and impressive. The silky frame rate helps hide barely noticeable instances of pop-up. Several racing camera views look cheesy, since the car fronts look like 2D cutouts, yet other views (such as the in-car view that shows the steering wheel, cockpit, and hands) look so sweet you may lose teeth. Added effects, such as the rain splashing off tires and lens flares add to the realism. But the game's realism gains most of its points in the racing modes, car modification, and physics. In addition to championship racing, this game has all the expected modes: arcade and simulation settings, practice and qualifying runs, a time attack, and a two-player split-screen duel. A unique bonus is a career mode, in which you take a driver through different teams to win a championship. Messing with the nine car-modification options is painless: A box shows the direct effects of each change on your car's performance, so you don't need to know the sport too deeply. The effects of car changes, which hint at the high quality of the game's physics model, make a marked difference on the track. You must treat your car gently and race smartly, as one mistake can end a race - this makes for nerve-racking, intense gameplay.

It will be fairly realistic, provide great gameplay, and work reasonably well out of the box. Until then, we'll have to settle for SSI's Panzer Commander, the latest in a somewhat disappointing group of tank sims released this year. <P> Parts of Panzer Commander are quite well done. The variety of vehicles is excellent, with more than 20 driveable tanks from Germany, Russia, the United States, and Britain and 28 support vehicles. The terrain modeling is the best of the current crop of tank sims. <P> There are ten scenarios for each nationality and six campaigns - three German and three Russian. The game also offers Direct3D acceleration, a powerful scenario editor, and excellent multiplayer support for up to six players over networks and the Internet. Panzer Commander can be immersive and fun if your expectations for realism aren't too high and you can learn to tolerate its frustrating flaws. <P> While the armored vehicles themselves look good and are modeled with a reasonable degree of accuracy, gameplay revolves around scripted scenarios with time limits. This alone could be enough to turn away many hard-core sim players. In addition, infantry is represented by static emplacements and fortifications. Although artillery and air support is included, you have no control over it. <P> Panzer Commander puts you in the role of tank platoon commander. You do battle from the commander's, gunner's, and driver's stations of your tank. By design, the units under your direct command are limited to the tanks in your platoon. While this is a more realistic approach, it's taken to the ridiculous extreme of providing you with minimal information and control prior to and during battle. <P> You can't view a detailed map of the terrain, and you're usually given no idea whether support units will be involved in the mission or how they'll be deployed and used. This makes it impossible to conduct advance planning or to coordinate your platoon's actions with friendly units. In many missions, combat begins with your tank under fire. If it's knocked out, the battle is over, which means that you often have to replay a scenario several times just to get an idea of what to expect and then develop an effective strategy. <P> The greatest flaw in the game is the inadequate pathfinding AI. Far too often, it causes vehicles to become stuck in impassable terrain or get hung up on obstacles. During campaigns, this can result in battles where your tank does most of the fighting alone. Other problems include friendly-fire casualties, direct fire through solid objects, and a few nonfunctional keyboard commands. Fortunately, SSI is working on a patch to address many of these issues. <P> The game largely succeeds in capturing the feel of tank-against-tank combat from a World War II perspective. Some will find its scope too limiting, the gameplay too unrealistic, the lack of control too annoying, and the bugs too frustrating. However, if you're looking for a not-too-serious tank sim that enables you to experience World War II armored combat, Panzer Commander could be the ticket.<i>--Patrick C.

Game cartridge is in good condition but may show normal signs of age such as minor scratches, discoloration, or debris in creases. All games are tested before being put into our inventory.', 'California Speed might sound like the new trendy drug of choice for Hollywood\'s swanky celebs, but it\'s merely Midway\'s translation of the arcade racing game from Atari Games. Still, ""drug"" might not be a too-far-off description for this game: Although it gets you juiced up with psychedelic, tripped-out track designs, its shallow gameplay and dated graphics quickly bring you back down to a catatonic stupor. Those of you addicted to simple arcade racers may still feel a ""rush,"" but for the rest, this game\'s a bad trip. <P>Clearly, the game\'s lone bright spot is its wild, colorful, over-the-top track designs. Whether driving up the Golden Gate Bridge, through shopping malls, or into UFOs, the tracks break from the plain-Jane race tracks very effectively. The tracks are also littered with pop-culture references (such as the Intel commercial drive-through in Silicon Valley), and scenic landmarks, such as the Hollywood sign and Pebble Beach. The game\'s connections to California will be most amusing to those of you who live in or have visited the areas featured in the tracks; if you are one of those people, this game\'s almost worth renting just to take the California Speed tour. The track layouts themselves contain a handful of secret shortcuts, which are easy to find by racing in practice mode. <P>Since this game is, at its roots, a fast arcade racer, it\'s ridiculously easy to learn. There\'s a brake button (rarely used), accelerator button (always used), and gear shift buttons (can be used, but doing so doesn\'t offer any advantage). Although the various cars available handle differently, the basic arcade driving maxim is in full effect: Don\'t hit stuff, and stay fast. It makes for mindless, shallow gameplay that\'s fun at first, but boredom-inducing in large doses. To combat that malady, the game offers an incentive to play on. The game offers a series of cups to compete in, and beating each cup unlocks a new track or secret car. <P>The problem with California Speed is that those same eleven tracks have to be raced over and over again to unlock these extras. The tracks\' novelty value quickly wears thin, leaving you with an uninspiring series of races. Since the computer AI doesn\'t offer any semblance of intelligent racing opponents (all they do is go fast, like you), there isn\'t much driving strategy to employ other than using the too-few shortcuts - additional branching paths may have given the tracks more replay value. And while the car designs (such as the golf cart) are extremely wacky, the default cars handle similarly enough so that the overalldriving experience gets monotonous, regardless of selection. <P>The Nintendo 64\'s limitations prevent an exact duplication of the game\'s arcade-level graphics, so the resulting visuals look just barely above average. While eye-catching in the days of the original San Francisco Rush, this game\'s graphics are on the verge of becoming dated. The animation, when driving fast, does get a little choppy, but it\'s not enough to hamper gameplay speed, which remains brisk at all times. As for the cheesy, bland audio tracks, there\'s thankfully an option to shut them off. <P>If you worship the looks and gameplay style of Midway\'s Rush series, this game just makes the grade. But if you think arcade racers are as burned-out as a Hollywood has-been, or as shallow as a bubbly bimbo from Los Angeles, California Speed offers very little to change your mind. --Nelson Taruc <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Psychic Force 2012,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"['Disc(s) only. Ships in generic case. Disc(s) are professoinally cleaned. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', 'Psychic Force 2012, a victim of limited appeal, will be missed by many but revered by the few that take a chance and import it. To those few, it represents what a niche fighting game should strive to achieve - extremely bizarre play mechanics, a steep learning curve, and highly stylized anime art. <P>In this game, you take the role of a ""psychiccer"" - someone imbued with paranormal abilities, such as flight and telekinetic projection of energy and solid objects. Each fight takes place in a clear cube suspended in midair, and characters float around inside until they are knocked out, at which point they crash to the floor or are blasted out of the cube as it shatters with the force of the final blow. As you hover, float, and dash through the air, you can come in close for some traditional combo-based punch-and-kick action or remain distant and fire a volley of projectiles. At any rate, and at any distance, the action is fast and at times hard to perceive. A wave of energy coruscates and throbs across the screen; the combo counter ticks, and suddenly your character is smacked to the bottom of the cube. The computer is an especially merciless opponent in this game and can make it difficult to get a good grasp on the gameplay, which can initially make the game seem like a terrible button-mashing experience, even though it can be so much more. <P>You have a shared psy and life gauge. As your energy decreases, your psy increases - this is what gives you the power to execute supernatural moves. These moves drain the psy meter, which then must be charged. The special moves are mostly of the tap-tap variety found in other 3D fighting games, and control seriously benefits from an arcade joystick, which you reverse to a neutral position on the completion of each move to facilitate smooth transitions in the arena. This is a game that requires almost surgical precision, deadly quickness, and a keen eye. The extremely steep learning curve is off-putting; it\'s hard even to crack it and get into the deep gameplay, let alone ascend it without obscene amounts of practice. <P>The characters are extremely appealing. From Emilio, the androgynous and haughty seraph, to Might, this game\'s take on the spiky-haired anime hero we are all intimately familiar with - they all shine with personality throughout the game. The voice-acting, in Japanese, is superb, and the story mode really glows with personality. But unlike its predecessor for the PlayStation, this game totally lacks any animated sequences. There are ten characters playable initially, and three more hidden, all with their own distinct personalities. Unfortunately, these personalities have all been lifted from other anime (as the very theme of this game has been lifted from Clamp\'s X, down to the protective cube erected by the challenger), and you will definitely be familiar with them if you have any grounding in Japanese animation. That they are handled so expertly is what keeps them from fading easily from sight and mind.  <P>The graphics are competent and appealing, if not technically excellent. Being a direct port of the arcade version, which runs on Taito\'s Wolf hardware, the game is  far behind the capabilities of the Dreamcast. The models and backdrops are made of a higher number of polygons than you see on current systems, and the textures, especially, are much nicer, but other Dreamcast games are clearly more taxing to the hardware. As for the music, it\'s old -school as game music goes. Provided by Taito\'s Zuntata sound team, it sounds basically like a CD-ROM soundtrack circa 1991. It is appealing, if that\'s the kind of thing that you like; it\'s definitely got that video-game music feel to it. The whole game has that sense. It\'s a video game, and it never tries to be anything else. There is no illusion that you\'re entering an interactive world or fighting a battle for the good of mankind. This is a game with graphics and life meters and pulsating green energy. <P>What will make or break this game for you is really the original and unintuitive gameplay. It\'s truly unlike any other fighting game out there. Easily dismissed, this game needs time devoted to it before its qualities begin to shine. The first few times you play this game, your initial reaction may be to blow it off and never try it again, because of the insane difficulty and the bizarre game system. That being said, it really is worth a second or even third look, because there is depth here to plumb. --Christian Nutt <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Multiplayer mode supports up to eight players. There's no other game like it on the Mac."", '<B>Bad News:</B> Poor control. Low frame rates. Multiplayer mode is limited to LANs.', ""&copy;1999 MacAddict -- <i><a>From MacAddict  --  Subscribe now!</a></i><br /><br />The original Carmageddon was banned in Brazil for inspiring road rage. Well, if you're the sort to play a game and apply those skills you've just cultivated to your real-life routine, then not only should you not come anywhere near Carmageddon II, but you should probably just be locked up somewhere safe. However, if you're not adverse to a little lowbrow humor and a lot of violence and mayhem, you'll find plenty of action and still more fun in the visually refined sequel. <P> You'll need to be at least a little mean-spirited to truly appreciate them, but Carmageddon II's graphics look good by any standards. The three dozen-odd cars are meticulously detailed and wildly creative: You get to drive and destroy everything from a tricked-out '70s low-rider sporting front-mounted jackhammers, to a muscle car crossed with a World War II prop plane, to a dragster, to a dune buggy, and much more. They're not real cars, but they look real enough, especially when you smash them (or into them) and they crumple and crack in all the right places. Then again, the cars in Carmageddon always did look good, although the same couldn't be said for their targets, the lowly pedestrians who were mere 2D sprites in the first game and didn't look right against the 3D cars. But now the pedestrians, comprising a cornucopia of humans and wildlife, join their hunters in the third dimension, which unlocks a world of gory, new opportunities for the player. They'll come apart at the seams, go flying through the air, burst into blood and guts, and worse as you careen into them in every which way, earning money for each and every kill. Were it not for the rather plain-looking tracks and a frame rate that can falter even on high-end systems, Carmageddon II would look entirely excellent. <P> Of course it's tasteless. But if the country can embrace a foul-mouthed and foul-mannered prime-time cartoon show, then it's ready for Carmageddon II. Besides, it's a funny game. You'll pick up dozens of different power-ups that affect the innocent bystanders in absurdly hilarious ways: They'll explode when hit, pop and fly away, dance in place, stumble like drunks, have huge heads, turn huge altogether, turn tiny, turn fat, turn tall, turn skinny, turn completely immortal - you name it. And the carnage is set to the perfectly appropriate music of the quintessential heavy metal band Iron Maiden, as well as a few guitar-heavy instrumental pieces that, while they aren't Maiden, aren't bad. Unfortunately, the other sound effects in the game are only fair, as pedestrian screams and steel wrenching against steel all start to get repetitive fast. <P> In any event, you'll probably be too wrapped up in the game to be bothered. Like the first game, you don't need to follow too many rules. You can race around the track past a series of checkpoints through several laps and end a race, but you'll often find it easier (and a lot more fun) to total all the enemy cars vying to do the same. Either objective is made both challenging and enjoyable thanks to the wacky hyperrealistic physics model behind the game that has cars careening through the air and against buildings and one another at the slightest invitation. You'll find yourself in all sorts of incredible and ridiculous wrecks, often with those hapless pedestrians at the center. Thankfully, you can magically repair or recover your car at the touch of a button, and for a price. And because the collisions rarely force you into a frustrating situation, and the physics model is so open-ended, and there are so many silly power-ups, Carmageddon II ends up being entertaining for a long time. <P> That's not to say it never gets annoying; because of the linear race progression, you'll sometimes get stuck on a timed mission objective that you'll have to replay until you get it right. But the game isn't all that difficult, and a little perseverance should get you past any roadblocks, metaphorical or not. What you're left with, then, is a game that isn't serious at all but instead offers a fun and colorful, albeit predominantly red, environment to drive across, through, or over. Carmageddon II isn't the most ambitious game you'll ever play, but chances are it'll be one of the more enjoyable games you've tried lately.<i>--Greg Kasavin</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

FIFA 99 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Official soccer game with the FIFA seal of approval. Emphasis is on realistic sights and sounds.', 'EA Sports has produced some of the finest soccer games on any platform. Last year\'s two versions of the FIFA franchise came replete with more options, stunning graphics, and hours of gameplay than ever before. With terrific animations, dozens of special moves and in-game strategies, it begs the question: Is there room for improvement, aside from just keeping up with new hardware and processing speeds? Little, but there is some. EA tweaked the graphics, added commentary and celebrations, beefed up teammate AI, and ""smartened"" sideline control - making FIFA 99 a better choice for the neophyte, and an almost-essential upgrade for the die-hard soccer enthusiast.', ""All the moves you expect from an EA Sports FIFA title are here: flick passes, diving headers, slide tackles, and rainbow kicks. FIFA 99 adds new moves like directional chest-trapping to bring the ball down away from enemy players. You can fake the receipt of a pass. And draw fouls. And push the goalie down with the touch of a single button. It's now possible to volley an airborne ball directly to a teammate's head or feet. Shots on goal now include a chip shot and a poke shot to disarm the unsuspecting keeper. These aren't the same static goalies of last year's editions either. Instead of automatically grabbing and holding the ball every time, sometimes they kick the ball away, other times they fail to gain control and leave it in play, dangerously close to the goal. Plus, you can now have a hand in their control, and though this primarily means deciding when to pick up or drop the ball, it's now possible to charge enemy strikers. The threat of charging goalies makes offensive timing more of a critical issue."", ""Tactically, there's nothing new here. Still, EA deserves credit for showing that soccer is in fact a game of strategy. It was the first to implement a strategic component in the electronic soccer world - something that has existed in video (American) football gaming since the Atari 2600 days. The four plays from World Cup 98 return here: For the defense, an offside trap moves the defensive line forward to draw the enemy offsides. Offensive plays include an attack press to team up on defending ball carriers to force a mistake near the enemy goal and two breakaway plays. And as in previous versions of the game, three separate customizable formations are available on the fly. If you're willing to tire your team out fast, you can effectively have the bulk of your squad in your territory and enemy territory, by switching formation whenever the ball switches sides of the field."", 'All this strategy is further customizable with the various setup options. Control each formation\'s orientation, from defensive to attacking, as well as each individual player\'s attitude, from ""calm"" to ""nutter."" In addition, all the usual stat and cosmetic tweaks recur in this version, so you can still create strange races of bald, neck-beard-sporting, super-strikers that are all speed and no endurance. Nothing new over last year\'s edition, but filled with possibility nonetheless.', 'EA Sports has opted for a more realistic use of color this time around. Gone are last year\'s candy-coated primary and secondary colors and saturated look, in favor of lighter yet more subdued and browner hues. In general, the frame rate is better, and the overall visual effect is a smoother one, although (very rarely) a frame rate glitch occurs, and the game hiccups during a wide camera pan. Last year\'s angry goalie assault of the ""cameraman"" must have been a big hit with the kids, because dozens of new grandstanding and pouting animations have been added. Dancing wingbacks, obnoxious taunts, and goalie retaliations are great, but it\'s the mellow and abject goalie hanging his head after blowing the tying save that gets me every time. Speaking of color, commentary is tighter and more varied this time around with a larger script and, more importantly, improved response time. You don\'t have the old problem of commentators declaring ""He\'s just given the ball away,"" two seconds late, when you\'ve already recovered and scored.', ""The most significant improvement in this year's version is in the AI. On the enemy side, defenders mark tighter than ever before. For you Americans, that means they play man-to-man faster, rougher, and closer to the forwards. You might actually have to learn a few of those special moves this time around (at least half of them are fancy dribbles suited perfectly for this purpose). Teammate AI is also superior to previous attempts. Through-pass runs are easier to pull off, making for supersonic breakaways, but even basic strategy is more effective now: Send a wing back up the sideline and fire it into the box. Nine times out of ten, your man is there. Used to be you could get away with passing blindly, not because teammate AI was good, but because enemy marking wasn't so hot. There'd be time to chase the ball without losing your momentum. These improvements make FIFA 99 more of a game of skill that emphasizes passing and control over hotdogging."", 'One thing no previous soccer title has ever pulled off with any realism is sideline recoveries. In most games, whenever a player first arrives at a loose ball, the ball travels a few feet along the same vector as that of the player\'s approach. As a result, it\'s almost impossible to recover a loose ball at the sideline, since the CPU doesn\'t know that the ball is dangerously close to being out of bounds and that no real-life player would dumbly kick the ball forward and forfeit possession to a throw-in. This flaw is the reason why you always see electronic soccer players sprint up to the ball only to tap it out of bounds - it\'s not some desperate and ingenious defensive ploy; it\'s a weakness in the code. At first I was skeptical of EA Sports\' claim to have built new ""bounding logic"" to remedy the problem, but the surprising and subtle results make for greater realism at the all-important periphery of play.', ""Last year's double dose of FIFA titles was a little confusing for soccer fans. Releasing FIFA 99 so soon after is also confusing. Who would buy three games with nearly identical engines in just over a year (first-person shooters notwithstanding)? FIFA Road to World Cup 98 had more than one hundred more teams than the later World Cup 98, which in turn had a wider array of in-game tactics and plays, and FIFA 99 has more of each than either of its predecessors. EA Sports has made terrific, if sometimes subtle, improvements to AI and control, making it the obvious choice of the three.<i>--Josh Smith</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Test Drive 5 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Cruising along mountain roads in a '98 Dodge Viper or '69 Chevrolet Corvette remains a dream for most Americans. If you share that dream, you'll want to check out Accolade's <I>Test Drive 5</I>, the fifth title in the long-standing driving series."", ""Included in the package are 14 modern exotic and 14 vintage muscle cars for use on 18 tracks, accurately recreating some of the world's most exciting driving locales. Some of the other playable cars include the '98 Jaguar XKR, '71 Plymouth Barracuda, '67 Pontiac GTO, '98 Aston Martin Advantage, and the '68 Ford Mustang."", 'Various game styles round out <I>Test Drive 5</I>\'s decent racing offering. Drivers can compete in a single race or test skills across multiple leagues. <I>Test Drive 5</I> also offers a new ""cop chase"" mode where players assume the role of a police officer and attempt to pull over any speeding racers; there\'s also a split-screen mode for head-to-head racing competition. Along with extensive play modes, <I>Test Drive 5</I> also includes plenty of candy for the senses with realistic rain and snow effects, night driving, and a pumping soundtrack featuring Fear Factory and KMFDM. If you\'re dreaming of solid arcade-style racing action, <I>Test Drive 5</I> offers many sleepless hours of enjoyment. <I>--Doug Radcliffe</I>', 'In the world of computer games, a product lives or dies according to how well it compares with similar products. This is, of course, old news for any serious gamer. After all, you\'re not going to fork over $40 for one game when you get a much better one for the same amount, right? Case in point: Test Drive 5 from Accolade and Pitbull Syndicate. While the game is a decent arcade racer with great graphics, plenty of cars, and a ton of tracks, it simply falls short of its number one competitor - EA\'s Need for Speed III - in almost every conceivable way. <P> One of the few areas in which Test Drive 5 can claim superiority over Need for Speed III is in the sheer number of cars and tracks available. Test Drive 5 offers a total of 28 cars, which, as in Test Drive 4, represent an even mix of modern sports cars and classic muscle cars. This number is a bit deceiving, however, as seven of these cars are ""locked"" at the beginning of the game (a ""feature"" I\'ve always loathed in PC racing games) and are likely to stay that way for a great many players due to Test Drive 5\'s difficulty and physics oddities (more on that later). Furthermore, four of these 28 cars are simply police versions of the game\'s basic Chevy Camaro, TVR Cerbera, Dodge Charger, and Ford Mustang. On top of all this, several of the cars in Test Drive 5 aren\'t all that much fun to drive. Cars like the Nissan Skyline, Cerbera, and Aston Martin Vantage - though beautiful and exotic in the real world - are decidedly plain and unexciting in an arcade racer. Besides, it\'s virtually impossible to win a race against the computer in any one of these cars, so why include them at all? <P> Test Drive 5\'s graphics are certainly on par with Need for Speed III, though Accolade\'s title does not handle distance rendering quite as well. Some of the car models are a bit plain, but all in all the game looks fantastic, with eye-popping reflections on every car and an impressive attention to detail on each of the tracks. I actually preferred the track design in Test Drive 5, in fact, because each road course seemed to be more realistic than those in Need for Speed III. Alternate routes can be found on almost every track, so you don\'t have to follow the same old line every time you race. <P> The game flew along on a Pentium II 300 with dual Voodoo cards, even at a resolution of 1024x768, but oddly there\'s no real sensation of speed. Whether you\'re driving 80 or 175 miles per hour, the game looks and feels exactly the same. This is incredibly disappointing, especially when you think you\'re going fast and a computer-controlled cop sails past to give you a ticket. The whole point of a game like this is to feel that rush of driving a car you\'ll probably never own in situations you\'ll probably never experience (or at least, that you\'d be very unlikely to survive). <P> Poor engine sound effects further reduce the game\'s sense of immersion, as most cars sound exactly the same. The Shelby Cobra - easily the best of the basic cars in Test Drive 5 - sounds great, but every other car sounds pretty weak. To make matters worse, the game\'s music (which is generally quite good) drowns out the sound effects unless you turn it down to the lowest setting. <P> In spite of its many other flaws, poor gameplay is where Test Drive 5 drops from contender to also-ran status. Basic races are extremely difficult, even on the lame-o difficulty setting with arcade physics enabled. Computer-controlled cars always out-accelerate you unless you\'re driving a Cobra. It is far too easy to spin out of control, and you lose far too much ground to the computer when you do so. Also, while AI cars can send you spiraling off the course with the slightest brush (and always seem to do so near the finish line when you\'re in first place), you can hardly ever run your opponents off the track. What this means is that while you have to fight your way back into the race after losing control, the same is almost never true of the computer-controlled cars. So not only do they get the jump on you at the start, they also rarely lose any ground over the course of the race. Even worse, spinning out an AI car is the only way to issue tickets in the game\'s cop-chase mode. And as long as we\'re talking about cop chases, why on earth do you have to hold down the button to keep your siren going? Simply put, Test Drive 5\'s general gameplay - and the cop-chase mode in particular - can\'t hold a candle to Need for Speed III. <P> Test Drive 5 does offer a drag racing mode that you won\'t find in Need for Speed III, but this is little more than a ten-second speed burst that loses its appeal after about three runs. Drive the Cobra and you\'ll win most of the time anyway. <P> So while Test Drive 5 looks pretty good in a vacuum, it simply does not compare well with Need for Speed III. As with the previous version, the only real reason to choose this over EA\'s arcade racer is to get behind the wheel of muscle cars like the GTO and Hemi \'Cuda. Otherwise, Need for Speed III offers better gameplay, cooler cars, and a much better pursuit mode (for all you law enforcement types out there).<i>--Michael E.

Israeli Air Force - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['A flight simulator that puts you in the air with the elite flying unit of the Israeli Air Force, pitting you against enemies of Israeli freedom. <i>Israeli Air Force</i> enables you to fly multiple formations within the same mission and jump from flight to flight.', 'It\'s all well and good to keep flying modern fight combat sims from the side of the Americans, but let\'s face it: The Yanks haven\'t had a good, old-fashioned hot war in a long time. The Gulf wasn\'t as much a fighter pilot\'s war as it was a fighter pilot\'s shooting gallery. But the Israelis and their plucky air force are on the front lines all the time. Since the Six Day War in the 1960s, the IAF has been racking up hundreds of kills and putting some of the hottest combat planes through their paces. <P> Jane\'s Israeli Air Force takes on this untapped source. Developed by Pixel, IAF is the latest entry in Jane\'s ""soft sim"" line. Unlike the hyper-real and quite complex Longbow and F-15, which model single planes in great detail, IAF models seven fighters with less depth, much like ATF and Navy Fighters. The result is a good mix of planes and action, with better-than-average flight modeling for the upper-midrange sim market. <P> The seven planes in the IAF arsenal are the F-15C/D Falcon (known as the ""Baz"" to the IAF), the F-16D (two-seater), F4E Phantom II, F-4 2000 Phantom, Kfir C7 (a low-cost, Israeli-built fighter), Lavi ATF multirole fighter, and the Mirage III. The MiG-23 and MiG-29 are also available for flying in multiplayer mode and custom missions. The planes have unique cockpits and handling properties, but systems and functions work using the same basic key layout, much like the other games in this series. <P> Flight and weapons modeling are distinct for each plane, so that you feel the agility of the F-16 and the sophisticated power of the Lavi. The more advanced avionics controls and modeling that hard-core flight sim hacks expect are not to be found here, but this is not that type of simulation. Modeling is definitely a step above ATF and Navy Fighters, but still far short of F-15-level complexity, and that\'s just fine. This type of sim is intended for fun and playability, and it delivers both with a minimum of learning time and fuss. <P> There are plenty of opportunities to fly all of the IAF planes in the familiar Jane\'s array of gameplay options. Forty-two hard-scripted missions are offered individually or in six campaigns covering the Six Day War, Yom Kippur War, Lebanon War, and three hypothetical conflicts against Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. A set of eleven training missions, a quick-combat scramble option, and the standard Jane\'s mission creator round out the scenario offerings. Missions are heavy on dogfighting, but there are plenty of ground-strike opportunities as well, and most missions involve multiple wings where you can chose air dominance, ground attack, or both. Eight-person multiplayer is stable and smooth via modem, TCP/IP, and LAN, with player matching on Jane\'s Combatnet. <P> The problem with missions is that they can be tough and unforgiving. Briefings aren\'t always clear, and too often you\'re required to perform a precise series of tasks in order to succeed. Missions are either recorded as utter success or utter failure, and too many times missing one target means failure. This problem becomes more pronounced due to one of the game\'s most touted features: the ability to hop between cockpits and flights. The AI isn\'t all that sharp, and even though you can control wingmen, you can\'t rely upon them to successfully fulfill all the mission parameters. This means some missions have you leaping from one role to another in multiple replays in order to juggle all the requirements needed for complete success. In single-player mode, this simply becomes too much at times. <P> The graphics engine is effective at high altitudes, with terrain and structures looking fairly sharp. Elevation data has been used to create accurate terrain data, so that low-level flying enables you to use hills and canyons for masking. Unfortunately, the terrain breakup at these low altitudes is pretty pronounced, with a fair amount of pixelization. As usual in a Jane\'s product, however, object modeling is tops. <P> Despite some missions that require a little too much cockpit hopping, IAF plays quite well and provides the right mix of flying challenge and accessible gameplay. As a worthy successor to Navy Fighters and ATF, it provides a sweeping selection of planes and mission types for gamers looking for quick fun instead of painstaking realism.<i>--T.

Hexen 2 Mission Pack: Portal of Praevus - PC,,"['hexen', 'portal of praevus']","['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>', 'hexen', 'portal of praevus']",{},"['For those who liked <i>Hexen II</i> and wanted more of the same, <i>Portal of Praevus</i> offered 15 new single-player levels with a new storyline, new foes and an all-new character class, the Demoness.', ""The <i>Portal of Praevus</i> expansion pack includes 2 continents. The first is Blackmarsh (medieval Europe) you've seen in the original <i>Hexen II</i> as well, but this time it's winter and thus the look is somewhat different. The second, longer hub is Tulku (theoretically Tibetan, but it's been mixed with Indian and Chinese), featuring amazing new architecture and a cool weather effect, snowflakes. <blockquote><i>Note: This expansion pack requires the original version of <i>Hexen II</i> to play.</i></blockquote>"", 'When Hexen II hit the streets, it was generally hailed as the best-looking first-person action game ever to see the light of day. When it came to gameplay, however, most gamers fell into one of two groups: While some loved the new, pseudo-RPG title, others criticized the confusing hub-based level design and the many arcane puzzles. Hexen II Mission Pack: Portal of Praevus represents good news for both groups. Not only does this game offer better graphics than its predecessor, but it also provides better level design, more comprehensible puzzles, and much-improved gameplay. <P> In Portal of Praevus, the four heroes from Hexen II return to Eidolon\'s castle to investigate an unnatural winter that has fallen across the land. A fifth character - the Demoness, Eidolon\'s former minion - also comes to investigate this ill-omened phenomenon. You choose one of these five characters and the game begins with you leaping into a huge fissure to investigate the fortress that lies beneath Eidolon\'s castle. <P> The game features 15 new levels, split between two hubs: Blackmarsh (the subterranean castle) and Tibet. In general, the levels are very well designed and seem to be a tiny bit smaller (and more manageable) than their predecessors. The architecture and texture quality are quite spectacular, and you\'ll often find yourself gaping at the amazing detail of the rooms while archers pelt you with arrows. Raven indeed has a flair for intricate room design, and it has never been more apparent than in Portal of Praevus. Eerie crypts, majestic throne rooms, meditation chambers, and snow-covered courtyards highlight an impressive list of settings in this game. <P> What sets this game apart is not just the level design, but also the extra touches that accent each map. When you run down the corridor of a Tibetan temple - under the curving wood supports and past numerous candles - you really get the sense that you\'re immersed in the setting. Similarly, Raven has gone to great lengths to create intricate decorations for most maps, including a number of impressive statues, furniture, banners, and windows. One room near the end of the game has an amazing, highly polished reflective floor. While the Jedi Knight team may still have the edge in overall quality of level design, Raven has no equal when it comes to dressing up a scene and creating exquisitely detailed texture maps. <P> Raven also creates some amazing polygon creatures, as the new Yakmen illustrate. These Minotaur-like creatures are some of the best-looking first-person shooter enemies yet seen. They huff and puff and shoot little icicle shards at you. They also move like lighting and like to head-butt you into oblivion. When you kill them, they dramatically fall to their knees before giving up the ghost. The other creatures in the game include multitudinous archers, imps, golems, skull wizards, spiders (which are still a bit too powerful), and other familiar faces. The new Were-Tigers are much like their Jaguar cousins, only more powerful and harder to kill. <P> Unlike Hexen II, which used a confusing web of hubs and interconnecting levels, Praevus uses a much more easily navigable hub system. You\'ll never feel like you are miles from where you need to be, and you won\'t be constantly running back over previously covered ground (both of which were major problems in Hexen II). Doors to new levels are clearly marked, and doorways you aren\'t yet supposed to enter are clearly locked or inaccessible. This cleaned-up hub system helps keep the action moving in Praevus and helps eliminate the old nuisance of running through empty levels looking for that last hidden puzzle piece. <P> Even the puzzles themselves are a bit easier to handle in Praevus. For one thing, you\'ll actually find clues located throughout the levels. Plaques typically serve to point you in the right direction, but books and tablets also offer advice from time to time. Also, those items that do provide clues are easily recognizable, so you don\'t have to bash up every bookcase and crumbling wall just to solve a single puzzle. Even better, Praevus also includes an Objectives Menu, which maintains a running list of the quests you are currently trying to complete. What also helps with the puzzle-solving is that Praevus switches to a ""cinematic"" view when you complete certain tasks so that you can see what it is you\'ve done, such as which door just opened. <P> As far as the Demoness goes, she is a welcome addition to the core group of heroes. Like the other character classes, this red-skinned creature has two special abilities that develop as you move through the game. First, she can land safely when falling from a great height, which can be useful in several areas of the game. Second, she has the ability to convert energy attacks against her into mana that she can use for her own offensive tendencies. Also, the Demoness has some impressive weapons at her disposal, including the Acid Rune, Firestorm, and the mighty Tempest\'s Staff. <P> One slightly disappointing area of Praevus is the lack of new multiplayer maps. You can now add the Demoness to the mix on existing maps, but there aren\'t any new ones. Raven has stated, however, that several new Hexen II maps have been developed and indicated that they may simply be made available as free downloads from HexenWorld. <P> The game does have a few other quirks, which are relatively minor. For starters, Praevus still uses a few too many artifacts in its puzzles. The Objectives Menu helps you keep things organized, but when you start running into unique item after unique item (the bell of this, the incense of that, the staff of what\'s-his-name), the game starts to feel a bit ludicrous. It would have been a bit better to give the lesser artifacts generic names, which would have made them seem more like the mundane items they are and would have also kept the focus on the more crucial, plot-driving artifacts. <P> Also, there is one truly annoying new monster that simply throws off the game balance. These little, bloblike creatures appear in caverns, hop around like jumping beans, and spit fire at you. They are difficult to see, difficult to hit, and do an inordinate amount of damage when they attack. The game would have been better if these things were made either less powerful or easier to hit. <P> Finally, some strange system slowdowns were encountered when using the new Firestorm weapon. It seemed clear that this was the result of texture-swapping, but the fact that it happened repeatedly seemed odd, especially on a Pentium II/300 with 64MB RAM and a Diamond Monster 3D II card. However, after trying to isolate the problem, it seems as if the Voodoo2 card may have been at the heart of the problem, because the problem could not be duplicated on a slower machine equipped with an older Orchid Righteous 3D card. <P> With its many gameplay improvements and its impressive level design, Portal of Praevus glides easily into the upper echelon of first-person action games. This is clearly a must-have for Hexen II fans, and even critics of the original game should find the new features, creatures, levels, and weapons suitably impressive.<i>--Michael E.

Recoil - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>Recoil</i> is a technology game with an antitechnology thrust. You are contacted on your computer by three dissidents from the future, asking you to save the world from a sinister network of computers that have taken over. To do that, you must command the Battle Force Tank, a state-of-the-art vehicle with morphing capabilities the evil computer network has yet to master.', 'Westwood\'s Recoil doesn\'t do anything particularly new. Yet it does a number of things particularly well. But not for particularly long. <P> In your basic Terminator plotline, the future is ruled by The Network, with humans now obsolete and doomed to enslavement by the robo-computer-type totality. Except, of course, there\'s the Alliance of Dissidents, which is humanity\'s last hope. The Alliance has reached back in time to you, the player. Help me Obi Wan et al. <P> You\'re ""jacked in"" as it were to a hacked network tank (as in ""battle"" not ""think"" - a distinction that will become a theme in the game). Incredibly arty distorted cutscenes give you the lowdown on each mission, with three actors fighting to get in front of the (fish-eyed, black and white, super 8) camera amid distorted text, lots of 1\'s and 0\'s, duplicate images, etc. If you do really well, the resident hot chick will call you ""sport."" <P> From there on out, it\'s just you against several hundred bad guys per mission. You know, the whole ""drive around, get busted up, pick up health bonuses and power-ups"" paradigm. <P> At first glance, Recoil looks pretty awesome. It pretty much plays like a first-person shooter despite the more facile third-person view (both are available). The thing that makes Recoil good is that the movement of the tank itself and its gun turret work independently of each other. Separate controls are utilized for each. This gives you the capacity for more than simple 90-degree strafing. Since you can rotate the turret a full 360 degrees, and leave it in place, you always have your guns pointing in the right direction before navigating corners, rolling over the crests of hills, etc., allowing for a more tactically savvy game. It takes some serious getting used to, however. While on the surface it\'s just a more involved mouse look, beginners will tend to get all twisted around and backward and smash repeatedly into walls. Thankfully, there are two instant ""realign"" keys, to align the tank chassis with the turret and vice versa. <P> Exacerbating the tricky controls is the tank\'s sometimes-sluggish response. Control is tight enough, but the thing is, after all, a tank. It rotates real slowly. It accelerates OK, and its top speed is fast enough to let you catch air off many an embankment. It\'s the rotation of the turret itself that is so infuriating, which I suppose is realistic, but after years of being spoiled by mouse look speeds set to max, some players will find Recoil frustrating. <P> A cache of special weapons, power-ups, and vehicle modes becomes available as you progress through the six campaigns. Some of these are pretty amazing. The sonic burst cannon has a nice ""rippling reality field"" effect, totally transparent but with waves of time-space-distortion-type stuff. The laser saber creates a nice eerie hum right before it vaporizes your opponent. The arc saber\'s high voltage electrical attack, which is haphazard looking but deadly accurate in its capacity to target multiple opponents at once (and requires no aiming), proves that lightning actually strikes more than once. The real payoff is in the tether-guided weapons, however. Both the tether-guided missile and nuke, once launched, switch to a ""weapon\'s-eye"" view, so you can steer them through the air. Nice. That said, the box promises 18 different weapons systems, but a lot of these are just upgrades of earlier systems. <P> The multiple tank modes are more disappointing. The game offers four discrete modes of play that unlock over the course of the game: tracked (default), amphibious, hover, and sub. The first three add little more than new looks to your vehicle. The only effect on gameplay is to unlock new areas. Whether driving on, hovering above, or wading through terrain, handling remains nearly identical. It is with no sense of relief that your hovering tank traverses molten lava - you wouldn\'t have even bothered attempting to cross it prior to achieving the hover mode. Play is so is so linear in Recoil that the acquisition of a new tank mode is anticlimactic. As soon as it is unlocked, you simply know that the next mission will send you over the new terrain, yet play will remain essentially the same. <P> It would be terrific if, once you unlocked a new vehicle mode, you had the choice of using it strategically. You don\'t. Transforming from mode to mode is automatic and occurs whenever the terrain requires it. It would be great if you had some decisions to make, like deciding if it would be safer to crawl steadily up the side of the mountain, taking out the opposition a little at a time, or to fly straight up the side, exposing yourself to fire from all the enemies at once, but making the destination much more quickly. This isn\'t possible because each change happens incidentally and goes all but unnoticed. <P> This wouldn\'t be such a letdown if the level designs were less linear. Most of them go something like this: Blow up the force-field battery, then go past where the force field was, then go blow up the dam, which will raise the water level and make more roads accessible, etc. Ninety percent of the mission objectives are to blow something up. My biggest complaint is that little or no navigational savvy, let alone strategy, is required to do that. Terrain tends to unlock as you go. Hence at any given time, whatever area is accessible (that you haven\'t already crossed) is probably where you want to go. You never really need to know what you\'re doing, let alone plan things out on the map. Most of the puzzles are a snap to solve as long as you have the firepower and the patience to take out the enemy forces with a little stealth. <P> That said, Recoil looks terrific. Cleanly rendered. Awesome weapons effects. Nice enemy unit design. The gentle rain falling on the lakes in the third level is an especially nice touch. In general, Recoil consistently dishes up detailed, smooth graphics with minimum bugginess. The only time things get rough is when you\'re being fired upon by, say, ten enemy units at once. Then things can get a little choppy. Most of the time the game looks great. <P> Some of the level designs look great too. The multiple bridges, waterways, and overgrown hobbyist-train enthusiasm of the fourth campaign is terrific. Level one\'s gladiatorial sandpit arena looks like Spartacus (or Double Team). The wide-open lakes and heavy machinery of level three look very cool. Still, no matter how you dress it up, blowing up stuff is blowing stuff up. The seven different multiplayer levels are based on components from the six single-player campaigns but with completely different maps and power-up locations. Online play is currently available only at Westwood Online. <P> Recoil\'s biggest problem is its inability to consistently entertain over time. It comes flying out the gate, guns blazing, with tons of enemies, a sharp look, relentless action, a badass tank at your disposal, and a distinct tactical advantage over the strafing of most shooters. Unfortunately, a few missions in, and the game has lost most of its steam. <i>--Josh Smith</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

All Star Tennis '99,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64']",{},"[""Have you ever imagined challenging Michael Chang to singles or  Jana Novotna in doubles? With <I>All Star Tennis '99</I>, you can jump  in front of the net and challenge some of the biggest names in tennis!  This 3-D simulation game brings you the excitement of real tennis  gameplay without the sweat."", ""Tennis has finally arrived on the N64. Why did it take so long? Well, it's really hard to do right. Did Ubi Soft do it right? Yes and no. Though passable, All Star Tennis 99 looks a little choppy, plays a little slow, and isn't particularly smart. But it does have Bomb Tennis. What's that, you ask? Read on. <P>Graphically, this is pretty average fare. Though the motion captures are fairly fluid, the characters themselves are choppy, and they suffer from significant polygonal flickering. The ones at the far end of the court are so noisy they resemble TV static. Thankfully, unlike in Ubi Soft's Tennis Arena for the PlayStation, there's no animated crowd behind the players to further obscure matters. (That always seemed like unnecessary drag on any game's engine, so it's nice to see it removed in favor of a cleaner look.) All Star Tennis 99 does OK in the illusion-of-depth department. (After all, this is tennis, and nothing much happens besides a ball approaching and receding.) Though the ball itself is essentially a featureless two-dimensional circle, its shadow provides enough of a sense of depth for you to get the job done.  <P>Like in many console tennis games before this one, control is tricky at first. As usual, the primary difficulty is timing. Multiple swings are available - for example, slices, lobs, etc. - but with the exception of the lob, the difference between these moves is negligible. The short slice just lands slightly closer to the net. That's about it. What's worse, there seems to be no real way to control the speed of your swing. Sometimes it's instantaneous. Other times it takes forever, regardless of the swing you choose. Another oddity is that control seems to be more sluggish from the baseline than from the net. Analog-stick support is a little dubious as well. It's not true analog, and it always reacts in one of two ways: Press it hard and you break into a run; nudge it gently and you creep forward for a preset half second or so, and then you run. <P>All Star Tennis 99 doesn't have the smartest AI, so you'll probably wish there was a higher difficulty setting than the three given. In fact, the only challenge it offers is in its special moves, which are almost as potent as they are off-the-wall. When you win points or engage in really long volleys, the power-up meter in your corner of the screen fills up. Once you've earned it, you can pull off some really strange stuff, like the one where the ball does a full stall on the net, is subsumed in a weird hypnotic mandala swirly thing, and then shoots downward at a frightfully acute (and totally unpredictable) angle. For the purist, there is an option to turn all special moves off. <P>But what's really weird is Bomb Tennis. That's right, Bomb Tennis. This bizarre anomaly is one of the strangest novelty additions ever to make the final cut in a sports game. Whenever the ball touches the ground, a large cartoony bomb appears with its fuse lit. A few seconds later, it blows, and if you're caught within the radius of the blast, you lose the point. Really weird. It's too bad it only takes a few minutes to realize that you can just play your whole game from the baseline and remain safely out of harm's way. The AI isn't smart enough to draw you to the net. Even a human would be hard-pressed to do that though, since you just don't have that much control over the length of your shots. <P>An average assortment of options rounds things out. You can select different-colored courts and balls. Eight licensed real-world players are included in the game. The women tend to play a faster game at the net; the men have more of a power backline game. Other than that, the differences are minor. The sound is typically austere. There is a sense of humor at work in the commentary, however, as the color man expresses a distinctly British distaste for the crowd's noisier tendencies. At one point, a cell-phone's ring draws laughter from the crowd, which in turn draws chastising words from the announcer.  <P>Ultimately, All Star Tennis 99's good-natured quirkiness is something of an afterthought to its middle-of-the-road gameplay. Though not a bad first tennis game for the system, if the graphics were smoother and the control tighter, the game would be a lot more fun.  --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Simply put, the game is a mission-based, character-driven adventure/shooter that attempts to ape the Super Mario 64 world, but ends up making a bit of a monkey of itself instead."", 'Buck Bumble is a big game, no doubt about it. There are 20 missions of varying size and depth (some longer and more complicated, some shorter and time-reliant), but all of them are rather frustrating, with the exception of the boss levels, which can actually be quite challenging and fun. The gameplay is linear, so you work your way through each level by utilizing teleporters and destroying generators to open Herd Gates that lead to the next area you need to visit. The problem with the way the missions are set up is that your progress means little unless you finish the mission with just one life. You can save the game once a mission is completed and you do have three bees to beat the game with, however, if you die, you start at the beginning of the mission, and all of your progress is lost.', ""The actual mission objectives find you destroying enemy satellite uplinks, planting explosives under targets, transporting nuclear devices to safe detonation zones, and so on. But besides reaching your goal, you have to gather items for points (ten thousand points earns an extra bee), fight off enemy spiders, weevils, wasps, bees, water worms, exploding mines and pods, and even wall sconces and gargoyles that shoot things at you as you work your way through. Encountering these creatures, especially the flying ones, is somewhat annoying at first, largely because when they attack you, you're unable to fight back or flee for a fragment of a second - a fragment that frequently means the difference between life and death and you going back to the beginning of the level."", 'The developers have emphasized the fact that when the going gets tough in the game, players will always have a way out, in any given situation - a trait the company considered ""unique"" among games. Well this feature is surely the bee\'s sting and honey. Yes, you can gather nectar from readily available flowers to increase your life, hide on a leaf to try to snipe at wasps with your limited freedom of movement, or crawl on the ground where some of the enemies won\'t attack you, but this type of gameplay promotes Darwin\'s antithesis: survival of the weakest. If you run, hide, cower, and take advantage of those ""outs,"" you\'ll spend an inordinate amount of time trying to complete your missions, and you can forget about doing so in the allotted bonus time for extra points. And you won\'t want to avoid the enemy insects, because by killing them, you often get extra ammunition for your pretty decent assortment of weapons. On a positive note, this collection of guns, each with a limited ammo supply, is diverse and works quite well. If you plan your attacks by carefully situating yourself on a rock, ledge, plant leaf or any other prop in a high traffic zone, you can take out your enemies, which are fairly predictable, and clear a path to complete your task at hand.', ""General gameplay aside, the bee's handling is not very commendable either. You can get a pretty decent speed going, if you're flying, and after several hours you'll be zipping through tunnels and around plants, but on the ground, forget it. You hobble along extremely slowly, so you'd better learn to stay in the air and like it. When dealing with the controls in battle, you'll exercise a lot of duck and cover. Fortunately, you can use the shoulder buttons to do a 360 degree loop up, over, and around to the back of the insect pursuing you, because the horizontal turning radius is a joke. For instance, working your way through a somewhat narrow section of a level with explosives in tow while trying not to hit the walls and other structures, amounts to an exercise in futility, until you die several times from bumping a gate opening or doorway, start the mission over, and eventually end up getting the hang of it. The key to everything seems to be going at a snail's pace, but what fun is that? This isn't a challenge at all, it's a curse - it's not a matter of learning to use a well-functioning, complex feature, it's a matter of making lousy game mechanics work just well enough so you can get by. Yet even though when standing on a ledge, in the air, or on the ground you don't have a lot of freedom of movement to place your sight onto targets around you, the cameras work moderately well over your bee's shoulder, allowing you to at least move your line of sight from side to side if not up and down. You can also focus in tighter on your subject, into a perspective that is fairly comfortable. --Lauren Fielder <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Shanghai: Second Dynasty,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<I>Shanghai: Second Dynasty</I> extends its tile-matching puzzle and traditional Mah-Jongg game empire with 10 new and classic games. Pair up tiles as fast as lightning in Classic Shanghai, battle and build in Dynasty, and try to predict the ever-changing winds in the all-new Windstorm. Plus, enjoy four versions of the genuine, four-player game of Mah-Jongg.', ""Activision's Shanghai: Second Dynasty doesn't really offer all that much in the way of new content over its three-year-old predecessor, Shanghai: Dynasty. It's got a few new tile sets, a number of new layouts, and some new game modes. However, it reuses the interface screens and much of the graphics of the game that came before it. As such, it probably won't seem like much of a value to those who already own Shanghai: Dynasty. But for those not yet familiar with the Shanghai PC game series, Second Dynasty's colorful graphics, soothing music, and encompassing array of both mah-jongg and shanghai variants are reason enough to recommend it to enthusiasts of either or both tile-based games. Despite its heavy reliance on the content of its predecessor, Second Dynasty still looks and sounds quite good. All tiles are presented clearly enough in mah-jongg and are enlarged to an even healthier size in shanghai. Each of the game's 54 tile sets is colorful and detailed, though only four of these are available for mah-jongg. The game's backgrounds aren't terribly complex; you usually play the game on a patterned shanghai table, a green felt table, or a blank blue background; and kids' shanghai includes five additional vibrantly colored backdrops. On the whole, Second Dynasty's visuals are simple but effective, as are its sound and music. Second Dynasty's sound effects are adequate if nothing else; clear visual cues complement equally clear audio cues when tiles of a certain suit are matched. Also, the canned voice-overs for both mah-jongg games and the helpful narrator in the kids' shanghai game are loudly and clearly spoken, and they are usually indicative of the events that just took place. In addition, Second Dynasty has ten different tunes you can choose to play in the background; each is relaxing and mellow, and each manages to be quite pleasing to the ear without being intrusive. Second Dynasty uses the same Windows desktop-style interface that Shanghai: Dynasty did. As such, it's an easy matter to get help; switch tile sets, backgrounds, or music; toggle other preferences; or jump to other games. Simply right-click on the background to pull up a Windows-style options box and choose whatever you like. The interface makes jumping from game to game and setting things to exactly the way you want them are extremely easy. Unfortunately, in high-resolution 1024x768 graphics mode, Second Dynasty retains the same small menu-screen text of its predecessor, which still clashes just as jarringly with the game's large, colorful tiles. Mah-jongg and shanghai enthusiasts who wear eyeglasses should consider themselves duly warned to keep their spectacles handy, or consider settling for playing at a lower resolution. <I>--Andrew Seyoon Park </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Hexen 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse lurk in the shadows before you. They are Death, Pestilence, Famine, and War. They are the root of all that is evil. They are the least of your worries. The last know Serpent Rider, Eidolon, lives. As the Necromancer, the Assassin, the Crusader, or the Paladin, you must defeat the dark generals and their Hell-spawned legions before you can face the Archfiend and attempt to end his ravenous onslaught. Go in peace and you will surely die.', 'The first of the highly scrutinized ""Quake killers"" to hit the shelves, Hexen II delivers a mighty blow, but ultimately fails to knock the king off his throne. Make no mistake: Hexen II is a game with many strengths - its design is superior to the original Hexen, it has a significant payoff for single players winding through its twisted corridors, and visually it is without equal in the action genre. But the game\'s attempt to break from the standard first-person shooter mold has some nasty side effects, and the end result is a confusing and often frustratingly difficult experience.', ""You choose your character from one of four character classes - assassin, necromancer, crusader and paladin - and set out on a quest to destroy the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Following their demise, you must combat the third Serpent Rider, Eidolon (his two siblings having been vanquished in Heretic and Hexen). There's a thread of a story tying the whole premise together, but it really just serves as a means of dropping you into the lush, graphically rich environments. Which isn't necessarily a criticism - the environments are the best thing about Hexen II, especially when playing the GL version. You'll explore five beautifully texture-mapped realms - a medieval village, a Meso-American temple, an Egyptian tomb, a Greco-Roman palace, and a gloomy cathedral. The visual detail - with tiled mosaics at the bottoms of pools and hieroglyphics on the walls of tombs - is like nothing ever seen in the action genre. In fact, it is not an overstatement to say that Hexen II is one of the most beautiful games ever made."", 'But while the artistic design is truly spectacular, the level design is often confusing. Like Hexen, Hexen II is divided into ""hubs,"" groups of interconnected levels that are intended to break up the monotonous ""kill monsters, find key, open door, kill some more"" design of typical first-person shooters. You must traverse back and forth through the various levels in each of the game\'s five hubs, finding objects and solving puzzles to gain entrance to new areas. This concept is sound, and indeed generally does succeed in giving you the feeling that you are in an environment, rather than a loosely connected series of passageways. But as you descend further and further into the game, a number of frustrating problems arise.', ""For one, the secret areas that are common to the genre are not simply rewards for the stalwart wall-hitter; in Hexen II you must find the majority of them in order to proceed. This leads to much backtracking though levels, searching every nook and cranny for some overlooked chink in the wall that may lead to a new area, bashing every bookcase in hopes of finding some means of continuing. The backtracking can be especially frustrating once you've killed all of the monsters in the available areas."", 'The second problem is that the puzzles in Hexen II are of the ""push some buttons in the right order"" variety. For example, at one point in the Roman hub, you must press four buttons - each embossed with an elemental symbol - in a particular order. The clues for solving these stumpers are sometimes vague (as in the case of the constellation puzzle in the Egyptian hub) and, in worst cases, nonexistent. Often the clues, such as notes on tables, are indistinguishable from decorative objects and the fear that you may have missed some important tidbit makes you feel the need to walk up to every piece of furniture in every room from every possible angle.', ""These types of design problems almost hobble the game, but Hexen II has enough payoff to make struggling through the difficult areas worth the hassle. At the end of each hub waits one of the four Horsemen, animated with astonishing detail; and Eidolon, the final boss, looks unbelievable. Go ahead and use a stone of summoning when fighting Death and watch as your demon and the Winged Reaper fight it out against a blood-red sky. It's really amazing."", ""As for the more common monsters you'll encounter, there are some nice innovations, despite the lack of variety (there are only eleven basic types). Monsters will duck to avoid your attacks, and there are area-specific monsters to match the various environments, such as the Roman medusa and the Egyptian mummy. The weapons also sacrifice quantity for quality - the character-specific art and effects are nice, but there are only four weapons per class. And the classes themselves have some subtle differences - attack ability, special powers - but not enough to make a significant change to the experience."", 'Of course, most of the aforementioned problems dissipate when playing multiplayer, and it proves a much better game against human opponents; even the differences between character classes are more interesting when fighting one another. But Hexen II\'s deathmatches aren\'t as purely visceral as Quake\'s - the assortment of power-ups and magical items often results in simply unloading all of your stuff on an opponent, and it becomes a case of ""he who has the most toys wins.""', 'A lot of work went into Hexen II, and it shows. But that doesn\'t stop the feeling that the game was rushed in the latter days of completion. It crashes as a result of simple commands (such as accidentally ""quickloading"" when you haven\'t ""quicksaved""), level load times are unbearable (we\'re talking sometimes over a minute), and each of the hubs concludes with the slow-scrolling text that has seemed like a sick joke since Doom II.', 'In the end, Hexen II has a lot of rewards, but the curious should be warned: It takes a great deal of perseverance to find them.<i>--Ron Dulin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

You\'ll race your Harley across the country in a mad race to the Mother of All Motorcycle Meccas--the Sturgis Bike Rally. As your journey unfolds, you will be faced with challenging competitors, unpredictable roads, intense weather conditions, and loads of obstacles.', ""Things start off great when you begin installing Harley-Davidson: Race Across America - you hear the roar of a hog revving up followed by the low chug-a-lug rumble of a massive Harley engine idling as the files are copied to your system. And you'd better relish those moments if you buy this game, because they're among the only authentic ones you'll experience in this latest addition to WizardWorks' ongoing line of Wal-Mart Wonders. It's not that there's an inherent problem with arcade racing games such as this. The problem with Race Across America is that its uninspired arcade-style biking action doesn't come close to doing justice to the big-name license that will surely coax a lot of people into buying it."", ""Race Across America lets you hop on one of six Harleys - Dyna Low Rider, Fat Boy, Softail Custom, Sportster 1200 Custom, Road King Classic, and a customized 1956 KHK you can only access after placing high enough in competition - and put 'em through their paces on rally routes in seven states. You can choose to race against three computer opponents in any of the states in practice mode, which is a good way to learn each route. But the only real challenge is in tour mode where you race through three states on the way to the annual biker rally in Sturgis, South Dakota. Where you place at the end of each of the three routes determines how much money you'll have to buy tires, carbs, mufflers, and an improved ignition for your ride."", ""Race Across America plays fast and smooth, but what really matters is whether it generates any genuine thrills. Unfortunately, whatever thrills it generates are few and far between. You'll suspect this problem even when you start choosing bikes and race routes. I can't think of any reason why static menu screens shouldn't be crisp and clear, but instead, Race Across America gives you blurry images of the venues and bikes that are similar to what you'd see after knocking back a six-pack or two of your favorite cold beverage. Add in menu buttons that only cycle one way - miss your bike and you go through all the others to get back to it - and you can see this game didn't spend a whole lot of time in QA. Once you hit the road, you'll be shocked to learn there isn't even a pause button - it could be a nod to real life, in which bikers often have to wait to put off that restroom stop, but my guess is it's just another sloppy oversight."", ""In an effort to make things more interesting, Canopy Games made gas stops a critical part of gameplay - actually the most critical part. The result is that after just a minute or two of racing, it's time to pull over and fill up the tank again, so you wind up spending as much or even more time scoping the horizon for Uncle Billy's Gas Mart as you do focusing on bent-for-hell racing. What makes this even more disappointing is that absolutely nothing has been done to breathe any life into these pit stops: You just sit by the side of the road and watch the fuel gauge climb to full in a matter of seconds. I was really hoping for some off-road excitement in a biker bar or even hanging around a hick town. Instead, all I got was a lousy tank of gas."", ""Of course, it might be a little unrealistic to expect anything more than racing in a budget game, but the racing here is dull, uninspired, and frustrating on the higher difficulty settings. Hey, I realize that Harley-Davidson would never give the go-ahead to show one of its fancy bikes smashed and crumpled after hitting a semi head-on, and naturally there's no way it would even dream of including injuries to riders. Still, we should at least get to see some spectacular flips or bikes hurtling off cliffside roads and smashing through billboards whenever mishaps occur. Hit a car head-on in Race Across America, and you simply come to a stop as your bike wobbles to one side. About the most excitement you can expect is doing a donut as you try to get back on the road."", ""Touch the side of the road and it's like you've driven into the La Brea tar pits - your speed drops from 120mph to 30 as you struggle to get that massive hog back on the asphalt. Applying the brakes for more than a split second has the same effect, so it takes a little practice to get used to staying on course at a reasonable speed. I've got no problem with that, provided the computer opponents labor under the same restrictions. But they don't seem to have to deal with the same issues unless you play on the low difficulty setting. On medium and high, they regularly zigzag off and onto the road and seldom lose speed, and they merely shrug off collisions, whereas for you, crashing often means winding up at the back of the pack for good. Even if you win and get to Sturgis, the only reward is - you guessed it - another race. This race is in and around the town that's world-famous for the thousands of bikers who show up each year, but these masses are nowhere to be found. I guess Canopy had enough trouble making a game with four bikers, much less one with thousands."", ""Race Across America supports multiplayer gaming over LAN, modem, serial connections, and the Internet, and the multiplayer setup menu also sports options to connect to HEAT and Mplayer. Between multiplayer support, a low price tag, the enviable Harley-Davidson license, and one of the coolest box designs ever, Race Across America will probably be another moneymaker for WizardWorks. And there are probably some gamers out there who'll find enough action here to make this a real bargain. I'm just not one of them.<i>--Chris Gregson</i>"", '--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

As with the arcade version, you'll race against the clock and numerous other boats in a quest to reach the finish line first. The spectacular graphics and detailed race environments make this a most atypical racing game. In fact, there are times when you might find it difficult to concentrate on the racing because there is so much peripheral eye candy. We were most impressed by the New York Disaster, Far East, and Arctic Circle racing areas."", 'Many of the best elements of <I>Hydro Thunder</I> are likely to be completely bypassed by casual gamers, since there are numerous hidden tracks, boats, and other elements to be uncovered in this game. However, persistent racers will be well-rewarded, since some of the best tracks can only be unlocked after winning several races. <I>--Brett Atwood</I>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Detailed race environments</li> <li>Numerous hidden game elements</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Difficulty level will challenge beginning gamers</li> </ul>', 'When you think about racing games, you naturally think of wheels - be it two, four, six, or ten. The most memorable racing games have put you on some sort of road. Why is that? Perhaps air is too bland in its sheer openness, and water simply doesn\'t deliver insane jumps, tight corners, and clever tracks. Prepare to reevaluate that opinion, because the best boat-racing game to hit arcades has made its way to the Dreamcast - but what it hasn\'t done is brought anything new with it. <P>If you\'ve played the arcade version of Hydro Thunder, you already know everything about the game. So little has changed, in fact, that you\'ll wonder if Eurocom even made an attempt to do anything more than port the game\'s code to the Dreamcast. There\'s no intro, no new modes, no CG of any form - just the simple single-race-then-start-over play style that you\'d expect from an arcade game. It\'s almost as if Midway were satisfied with simply changing ""insert coin"" to ""press start"" and was done. This game has only two modes - play on your own, or play with a friend. There\'s no time trial, no tournament, no battle or practice mode, just the pay-per-race-styled ""game"" mode that you\'re already familiar with. And once you\'re actually in the game, there\'s not a whole lot you can do besides race. There\'s no difficulty control besides the actual track you pick; the mid-race pause menu has no options control; and the game doesn\'t even allow you to restart your race. You\'ll have to quit out to the title screen and choose your track and boat all over again. But what the user interface is lacking, Hydro Thunder more than makes up for in gameplay. <P>Boat-racing games have had little success because of the vast difference in physics from conventional street racers and the inability to replicate this difference accurately. Hydro Thunder breaks that trend and shows that boat racing is indeed a different dish. The engine was built entirely from the ground up, and it\'s clear that the team had spent plenty of time making the physics as real as they\'ve ever been in a boat game. Probably the most impressive aspect of the engine is that you can see your boat bounce in the wake created by another racer. These effects, combined with the realistic nature of the game engine easily make Hydro Thunder the best racing game to hit the water. <P>Speed is a racing game\'s most essential attribute, and Hydro Thunder has plenty of it. Even with tons of on-screen activity the frame rate is silky smooth, and pop-up simply doesn\'t exist. In the first-person view a breathtaking sense of speed is achieved, with only slight diminishment in the other views. The graphics are simply amazing. All the different flavors of boat racing are represented in Hydro Thunder - from catamarans to powerboats to nuclear-powered concept racers. And each boat not only has a distinctive hull shape, but it also has distinctive markings and flair. But that\'s just the beginning. The real eye candy is contained within the tracks. The track design is really innovative, and it takes advantage of the water setting. There are approximately three different types of water present in Hydro Thunder. The deep water comes in two types - calm or choppy, which are easily distinguishable by the excellent graphical effects. The third type of water is the calm shallows, from where you can see the river\'s bed, which is often littered with buried treasure, sunken ships, hungry sharks, or derelict aircraft. But easily what is most impressive about Hydro Thunder\'s graphics is how much you can see. All the tracks have hugely detailed backgrounds, and, as stated earlier, pop-up has taken an exit. <P>Not only does each boat have a distinct graphical look, it also sports its own engine effects. Some engines give the throaty growl of 16-cylinder gas guzzler, while others have more of a high-tech whine. The sound effects are done well, with good use of voice effects in the form of your aviator\'s private radio and the announcer. The music is all tense race-it-up-type music that makes it easy to use a lead foot. <P>If the Dreamcast controller excels at any genre, I\'d have to say it is racing. The analog buttons on each shoulder are easily the most comfortable and intuitive setup I\'ve used in a while, and it gives you better control than the arcade version did. The boost-jump is incredibly easy to use, and it helps you take full advantage of every track\'s secrets. The game\'s thirteen courses are full of huge falls, hidden areas, jumps, tunnels, shortcuts, and more. Want to tunnel through an ice cave? You can. Want to race under the docks of Venice? Do it. Feel like racing through King Tut\'s tomb? It\'s all you. <P>Unfortunately, the game\'s AI is a bit frustrating. It would seem that the computer-controlled opponents are faster depending on which boat you select. If you choose a faster, more difficult boat to control, you\'ll be up against faster opponents. This makes it a bit lopsided, as you get none of the pros but all the cons inherent in choosing a more difficult boat. So, in short, the best boats to select are the slowest ones, unless you\'re less concerned with winning the race than you are with placing the fastest time. Perhaps the most frustrating element of Hydro Thunder is the outright difficulty. You always start in fifteenth place, and the only way you can win a race is by hitting every boost, taking every shortcut, and hitting no walls. As if that weren\'t enough, Hydro Thunder retains the time gates - an arcade element. This makes finding shortcuts more accidental than intentional, as you\'ve no time to stop and explore the track. <P>Hydro Thunder was the best boat racing game to ever hit the arcade, and the Dreamcast version carries that tradition to the consoles. However, it suffers from a user-unfriendly interface and brings absolutely no extras home. Without a tournament mode, the game\'s replay value is hindered incredibly, and the lack of practice modes or time trials make the learning curve very steep. Hydro Thunder is a game I desperately wanted to like, but I was ultimately discouraged by the actual game because of the still-present arcade feel. At its core, Hydro Thunder is still a very exciting, edge-of-your-seat racer that offers awesome graphics and a solid engine, but in the end it almost punishes you for liking it. --Ben Stahl <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Moto Racer - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Play a motorcycle racing game in a first-person view, turn off any foreground graphics and engine noise, and you have to wonder what makes it different than a car racing game. How do you know if you're straddling or sitting? If the motorcycle game is enough of a simulator, you should be able to tell. The first thing you'll notice is how long it takes to pitch the bike left and right as you lean into turns; a race car's steering wheel should have a noticeably faster response. There's also the rate of acceleration/deceleration, and that's about it. <P> Although you can't really categorize Moto Racer as a simulation, it does attempt to make the experience more like racing a motorcycle, whether it's a high-powered superbike or a motocross dirt bike. You have to race both in this game, and each one is considerably different than the other. And even though the game is not a simulator, the two different bikes and the tracks in the game offer enough of a variety to make it plenty challenging. In contrast, the Playstation version of Moto Racer is much more of an arcade game, and is therefore easier to control, handle and win. <P> Set the PC version of Moto Racer on the easiest difficulty level and it's still pretty challenging. It might take you dozens of laps on a certain track to get good enough to place in the top three, which is what you have to do to progress through the championship ranks - and access the last four tracks included in the game. You start every race in the back of a field of 12 riders and have to fight your way to the front, while avoiding the sides of the road. (Another thing that makes the Playstation version easier is that there are only eight bikes to contend with, and all ten tracks are immediately available.) Some of the tracks offer a little room on the shoulder, but if you go too far, you'll bounce off the sides and slow down considerably. The fact that you hardly ever go head over heels across the road is not very realistic, but then again, this isn't a sim. <P> There are eight tracks total in the game. At first you might feel ripped off knowing that there are four tracks that you can't access until you place at least third on the first four tracks in championship mode. But after that, the tracks are available everywhere else in the game (including practice and single race modes). Although this may at first seem frustrating, it adds to the challenge and acts as a sort of prize for success. <P> The only problem is, it can be damn hard to get that prize. You have to run some nearly perfect races to place, since it seems that the computer riders don't make many mistakes, especially those at the front of the pack. On the Playstation version, you can smoke through races with little problem, even at the highest difficulty setting. <P> An important part of the game is choosing the right bike for each track. Each bike has four variables: acceleration, maximum speed, grip, and braking. Braking seems to be the least important, since you don't use the brakes much, but the others are extremely important, and can make a world of difference. <P> As important as it is to find the right bike, it's almost as important to play on a high-end machine, preferably one with a 3D card and MMX, since the game supports both. Play on a lower-end machine, like a P133 - which, admittedly, is not that low-end - and you'll suffer through some pretty slow frame rates. Part of the problem is that there are only two resolutions to choose from: 640x400 and 640x480. Other than that, you can switch to a letterbox view, but that's about all the tweaking you can do. <P> Still, Moto Racer is playable on a P133, and there's no denying that it's quite challenging. Don't expect to win these races after only a half-dozen tries. Some races are easier than others of course; for the most part, though, you should expect to spend some frustrating time trying to place in the top three. But the prize is four more tracks to ride on!<i>--Tasos Kaiafas</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Mr. Dark has captured all of the Toons, and destruction and chaos threaten the world. The only person who can reverse the situation is Rayman. He must travel through 30 levels that span nine different and unique worlds. Luckily, our hero can run, jump, punch, and helicopter his way through each level. There are enemies to defeat and power-ups to be gained the most useful being the Tings, which provide Rayman with clues and extra lives. More ambitious players will want to go through every stage several times, as there are objects that cannot be reached until Rayman has learned certain skills by progressing through the game. Anyone who enjoys RAYMAN on other platforms will certainly appreciate the Game Boy Color version', ""One day, the Great Protoon - the Toon your entire world revolves around - is kidnapped. Adding insult to injury, Betilla the Fairy's powers are stolen, preventing her from bringing joy to the world. As Rayman, it's up to you to release the imprisoned Toons, collect life-giving tings, and face the villainous Mr. Dark. Succeed, and your world will be revitalized. If you fail, you, Betilla, the Great Protoon, and all of your Toon friends face a world of enslavement. Quite a heavy plot for a Game Boy Color game, sure, but Ubi Soft's Rayman is up to the challenge. Across the game's seven multistaged levels, you'll run around, jump over, climb over, and float past a variety of obstacles, usually of the bottomless-pit or floating-monster variety. Indeed, Rayman is as faithful to the archetypical platform game as you can get. Walk forward, jump, climb and shoot - that's pretty much all you have to work with. Though this kind of gameplay isn't revolutionary, the responsive control, the diverse array of power-ups, and an engaging plot help make Rayman a worthwhile game. Some people will find minor gripes with the game's obstacle repetition and lack of boss characters, but these faults don't greatly mar the overall experience. Whether you're swinging from rings, floating over spikes with a helicopter, or jumping from vine to vine, Rayman just exudes fun. As GB platformers go, the graphics are usually mediocre. Rayman, on the other hand, laughs in the face of this stereotype and delivers exceptional visuals. Levels are lushly drawn, giving the impression that you really are traveling through cartoon forests, dangerous dungeons, dark caves, and dank caverns. Rayman walks with a fluidity resembling that of televised cartoons, while his variety of stationary poses and taunts continually delight the senses. From the fluidity of swinging across rings to dangling from rock formations, the GB Rayman does its past Saturn and PlayStation counterparts much justice. While the Game Boy Color's greatest weakness tends to be its sound chip, Ubi has also managed to imbue Rayman with enrapturing music and appropriate sound effects. Jumping, punching, climbing, and water-splash effects are particularly impressive. Musically, the game is wonderful. Each level has a different background track that befits the overall scenery of the stages within it. The initial forest-level music is a mixture of New Age and catchy cartoon beats, whereas the fiery-depths stage possesses an oppressively catchy, spooky backbeat. Rayman isn't too complex, but his various abilities, coupled with a heartwarming quest, makes for an enjoyable game. Furthermore, the game drips with replay value due to the required back and forth travel across the game's seven levels. You'll literally explore each level three or four times with newly acquired skills and power-ups, and you'll find something new every time. Furthermore, if you have a second Game Boy unit and an Ubi Key-enabled game title, you can unlock an entire additional level within the game. Had Ubi included a few more sound effects and a bit more creativity, it might have released the ultimate platform title. As it stands though, Rayman is exceptional in its own right, and one of the better titles to hit the Game Boy Color in recent history.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Ships in generic case. Disc(s) are professoinally cleaned. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', 'Evolution comes under close scrutiny as the first ""real"" RPG for the Dreamcast system. Does it live up to the expectations of a true next-generation gaming experience? Does it deliver the realism and cinematics that this new hardware is capable of? The answer is: not really. Evolution centers around Mag Launcher, a jaunty young man with a mop of spiky red hair and a cybernetic frame strapped to his back. The CYFRAME is a large device from which a cartoonish white hand can protrude and whack enemies during battles, or it can be used for such things as zipping down a rope to escape a collapsing ruin, as shown in the opening movie. He is joined by the mysterious and silent Linear Cannon, a blond waif with huge pink eyes and strange powers. His faithful butler Gre Nade, the foxy Pepper Box, or the strange, small, and creepy kid Chain Gun can make up the third member of your party. The plot centers around Mag and company\'s excursions into ruins scattered throughout the Northrop Continent as they scour these huge multilevel dungeons for treasure and get rewarded at the mysterious Society that is devoted to these explorations. In fact, at least 95 percent of the game takes place in these dungeons, which can last for over four hours each. Fortunately, it is possible to save your progress in the dungeon between floors if you do not have the time in your schedule to commit to such a lengthy exploration. All told, dungeon crawling makes up about 15 of the 16 hours it takes to conquer this game, but only about 30 minutes center around Mag and his friends. Just who is the enigmatic Linear, and where did she come from? Why is Eugen, the commander of a huge military force, so interested in her? What does she have to do with the CYFRAME Evolutia? And just what happened to Mag\'s father? As the game progresses, the plot becomes more frequent, even affording a smattering of full-motion video throughout the final hour of the game.', ""The highest-quality facet of the game has to be its battles. In fact, it is easy to presume that most of the development time and effort in this game went into the battle engine. These are above-average turn-based battles with a multitude of special attacks and spells, where extremely detailed and attractive characters and enemies fight it out in full polygon glory. In fact, the graphics in these battles quite effortlessly surpass those of Final Fantasy VIII as seen in the Brave Fencer Musashi demo, while perhaps lacking that game's artistic scope. Not only do the battles look gorgeous, they are also possessed of a real technical excellence as well. There is a feature unique to this game that really deserves to be adopted by developers everywhere: Down the right side of the screen is a meter with characters and enemies represented in order of battle priority, allowing you to engage in a level of tactical planning almost unknown in RPG turn-based battles of yore. The enemies and players are each arranged in three lines; the further one has to run to attack, the less damage it is capable of doing. Some spells and special attacks only affect one line of enemies or characters, while others are all-encompassing. This adds another tactical element to the strategy of battle planning in Evolution, which can become a necessity to master, as the game becomes extremely difficult the further one proceeds through it."", 'The graphics are of uneven quality; while the battles are stunning, the dungeons are completely boring and utilitarian. Bare corridors stretch almost endlessly, and while the texture maps are certainly of extremely high quality, they can easily become quite uninteresting after a short while. The dungeons rotate freely using the L and R buttons on the underside of the Dreamcast controller, and there is an automapping feature to make the exploration as painless as possible. But after four hours in one dungeon, the games does have a tendency to become somewhat tedious. The save feature between floors will be most welcome to almost all who play this game.', ""Really, when rating this game one has to question what the basis is for a truly enjoyable RPG experience. As stated, the plot is dull, hopelessly clichd, and almost completely absent for a great deal of the game. That said, there is still enjoyment and quality to be found here in the exploration and conquering of the dungeons and bosses that await. While the game is above average, the weak plot does keep it from becoming a classic of the genre. There is no real reason why this game should not make the Dreamcast launch in the US; it's a genuinely satisfying experience, even if it is a bit textbook in execution and scope. --Christian Nutt <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

S.C.A.R.S. - Nintendo 64,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['You may have heard of Ubi Soft\'s S.C.A.R.S (or Super Computer Animal Racing Simulation) before, as it came out for the Sony PlayStation several months back. A futuristic racing game that melded the gameplay concepts of Psygnosis\' Wipeout XL and Nintendo\'s Super Mario Kart together, S.C.A.R.S. was a surprisingly fun combat racer on that system, silly back story (virtual reality racing in animal-themed cars circa the year 3000) aside. Unfortunately, the Nintendo 64 version is another matter entirely. The game offers five animal cars (mammoth, lion, rhino, shark, and mantis) at its outset, each of them varying in degrees of speed, armor, grip, and weapons. If you want to go for speed, you use the speedy mantis or shark, while if you\'d rather shoot your way through the competition, there\'s the heavily armored and weaponed mammoth or rhino. The title\'s grand prix mode is composed of three main cups, good for at least several races each, and a customizable cup that can be set for up to eight races. The challenge mode has you race against one of four extra rides (scorpion, cheetah, cobra, and panther) that become playable only once you\'ve beaten them, which is far from easy - they don\'t call it challenge mode for nothing. The earlier reference to Wipeout XL pertains mostly to S.C.A.R.S.\' futuristic theme and color palette, while the gameplay has more in common with Super Mario Kart, with all the power-sliding around corners that goes on within. The power-up and weapon systems are similar to both, with numerous and varied icon-based items spread all over the tracks for you to pick up. The standard missiles, shields, and turbos are present, with the more imaginative magnet (freezes drivers in place for a few grueling seconds), two kinds of energy barriers that have to be leaped over, and a cool ticking bomb that gets passed back and forth from racer to racer like a hot potato. Visually, S.C.A.R.S. on the N64 is a great letdown. The PlayStation version had fantastic lighting effects, sharp colors, and a good feeling of speed, but on the N64, S.C.A.R.S. is blurry, not quite as fast, and has much more overt draw-in (even more so in the multiplayer mode). The music has also taken a major hit, replacing fairly listenable tracks with ""noodley""-sounding sub-techno. Even with all these plusses turning up minused, the game\'s multiplayer mode could\'ve helped it catch back up by including additional modes (such as a Mario Kart 64-style deathmatch), but alas, you just get to race up to three other human players in smaller, graphically less-impressive windows. The PlayStation version of S.C.A.R.S. wasn\'t incredibly deep but offered a lot of good, dumb, driving/shooting fun and was at least worth checking out, but there really isn\'t much reason to look this title up over the rapidly growing number of futuristic racers on the N64.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Interstate 82 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""It's 1982, and auto terrorism is at an all-time high. The U.S. is in crisis and you, legendary road warrior, Taurus, are dealing with a crisis of your own. Your long-time partner, Groove Champion, is missing, and it's up to you to keep him from becoming a skid mark in the mother of all wars on wheels. Wage fully charged vehicular combat as you strive to uncover and destroy top secret forces before they drive you--and the entire country--to the brink."", ""Interstate '82 is the sequel to Activision's MechWarrior-in-a-muscle-car game, Interstate '76. It takes place in 1982. Groove Champion, the hero of the original game, is missing, and it's up to his sister Skye and his old partner Taurus to find out what happened. Taurus has since traded in his vigilante lifestyle and his Afro for a more modern Miami Vice look. The rest of the cast shows off most early-to-mid-'80s fashion statements, from Mohawks to silk scarves. However, Interstate '82 simply doesn't stand up to the original because of its simplified gameplay, weak single-player opponents, and unreliable multiplayer mode."", ""The best feature in Interstate '82 is its story. The story is told through prerendered cutscenes and occasional mid-mission CB radio chatter. The voice work is really quite excellent throughout the game, from the villain that sounds like he's doing an impression of someone doing an impression of Christopher Walken to the hilarious overdubbed swear-substitutes, which give the entire game a B-movie-on-cable feel from beginning to end. In addition to the outstanding voice acting, the game also has some pretty good music, including three Devo tracks. The rest of the soundtrack is typical '80s new wave and fits pretty well."", 'The most notable new gameplay addition is the ability to leave your car and get into other cars. This opens up a whole world of possibilities because now you\'re never left waiting to die in an ammo-depleted, heavily damaged vehicle, and can simply hop out and look for a new ride. Of course, you\'re an easy target once you\'re on foot, and your pistol isn\'t very effective against a heavily armored car. A few missions also have switches and things that you must get out of your car to manipulate. In addition, unlike in the original, you\'ll be able to change cars several times throughout the course of the story mode, since you\'ll continue to the next mission with whatever car you used to finish the last mission. Each car has a different configuration of empty slots that let you add additional armor and weapons. Naturally, larger cars can accommodate larger weapons, like turreted machine guns and different types of ""karpoons.""', ""Interstate '82 comes with its own player-matching service, which connects you to a chat lobby and displays a list of available multiplayer games. It's easy to get into a game, but actually playing an Internet-based multiplayer game is a different story. Even if you've got a good ping to the server, you can expect plenty of choppy gameplay, delayed deaths, and all sorts of other problems."", ""As a result, you'll want to stick to LAN play whenever possible. It's a shame, because the game has a few fun multiplayer modes, including the standard free-for-all, a capture-the-flag variant called capture the trout, and hot potato, in which you pass a bomb back and forth between cars until one player gets stuck with it and explodes. You can pick from any of the game's cars for multiplayer play, and you can arm and protect it in any way you see fit. Also, you can load the cars' paint jobs into your favorite graphics editor and customize their appearances. The custom paint jobs are sent to other players in multiplayer games, so you'll be able to share your detailing skills with others."", ""As far as the single-player mode is concerned, Interstate '82 has problems with enemy cars' artificial intelligence. Even on the hardest of the three difficulty settings, you can defeat most enemy cars by simply backing up in a straight line and gunning them down as they give chase. Granted, if you're supposed to be defending something, this tactic isn't as effective, but the AI's generally poor aim and its willingness to sit in your sights and take heavy fire make the single-player game easier than it should be. At least Interstate '82 controls pretty well, which makes it fairly easy for you to drive, target enemies, and select different weapons at the same time."", ""Interstate '82 looks fairly good but a little dated compared to other recent games that require 3D hardware. There's a fair amount of pop-up on the horizon and it isn't masked at all, so one second you'll be staring at the background texture, and suddenly a large wall will fade in. Although the game generally moves well, you never really get a good sense of speed in any of the available camera views, and the graphics aren't exactly dazzling anyway. The plain-looking in-car view is particularly ugly - it would have been nice to at least see your car's dashboard in the first-person perspective."", ""Such problems seem even worse when compared with the original game. Where Interstate '76 was cohesive and involving, Interstate '82 feels unfocused and generic - it's more than a mission pack, but less than a full-fledged sequel. If you're only interested in the continuing story, then it's definitely worthwhile. But if you're after a complete game, then you're better off with the original. -- <i>Jeff Gerstmann</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Test Drive Le Mans - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<I>Test Drive Le Mans</I> roars to the virtual race course, delivering a realistic racing sensation of 200 mph heart-stopping action on the PC. Gamers compete on official Le Mans sanctioned courses, including locations in the French Alps and landmarks such as the famous Dunlop Bridge. Players choose from more than 50 cars and 25 racing teams, each with multiple styles, individual engine sounds, and set-up routines, allowing players to maximize performance. With vintage Le Mans around-the-clock racing, day-to- night-to-day lighting conditions, and realistic nighttime effects, <I>Test Drive Le Mans</I> promises intense racing action.', ""If you pick up Test Drive Le Mans expecting a full-blown simulation with realistic physics and a strict adherence to the motorsport's format and rules, you're likely to become very disappointed. There are no two ways about it: Test Drive Le Mans is an arcade-style racing game through and through - but the good news is that if you can look past some of the design decisions and oversights, the action is actually pretty satisfying. <P> Test Drive Le Mans offers three modes of play, all presumably designed to let impatient gamers jump into a GT1, GT2, or prototype vehicle and start racing with minimal muss or fuss. The arcade mode features three race types: Practice and time attack put you alone on the track, while challenge puts you at the back of an eight-car field for a five-lap race. To play for the championship, you sign up for a lowly GT2 team and try to climb your way up the ladder to the faster prototypes and GT1 divisions by finishing first at the end of the season. Finally, there's the 24 hours of Le Mans itself, which offers a time-compression feature that lets you see the transition from day to night and back again in a race as short as 12 minutes. <P> Regardless of which mode you choose, you'll soon see why hard-core racing-simulation fans are likely to shake their heads at Test Drive Le Mans. Only three camera views are available, including a bumper-cam, a hood-cam, and a behind-the-car perspective, so you can forget the idea of sitting inside the cockpit of your car. The game's setup options are paltry: You can modify your car's fuel amount and choose from several tire types, three generic downforce settings, and three steering-sensitivity settings, as well as toggle traction control and transmission type, though the game completely ignores gear ratios and brake bias. This grade-school garage will be your first inkling that Test Drive Le Mans doesn't model a whole lot of real-world detail - a suspicion that'll be confirmed when you see cars stick to the track like slot cars, even in the sharpest turns. <P> But real-world physics and cockpit views are two of the biggest drains on CPU horsepower in a racing game. And because Test Drive Le Mans isn't burdened with them, the developers were able to use those resources to create impressive car graphics and hauntingly realistic trackside scenery, and still achieve smooth frame rates even at high resolutions. Once you accept that you'll simply have to downshift or decelerate to negotiate 95 percent of the turns in Test Drive Le Mans, you'll find that its combination of drop-dead gorgeous graphics and phenomenal sensation of speed would surely make all but the most serious race fans smile. <P> The game features seven tracks besides Le Mans, but whether or not they're based on actual tracks is a mystery. The box copy claims the seven circuits are ACO approved, but in trying to find out more about their real-life counterparts, the best I could come up with was that some of them are named after certain sections of the Le Mans course itself. This is just one example of the carefree attitude the game and manual take as far as familiarizing us Ugly Americans with the nuances of the motorsport. -- <i>Stephen Poole</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Trespasser - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Trespasser is the most frustrating game I have ever played. Of all the games I have ever reviewed, this one has been the most disappointing. Of all the games I have played, this is the one I am most adamant about never wanting to play again. I don't want to sound mean-spirited, but all gamers should know that Trespasser is a frustrating game, filled with boring gameplay and annoying bugs. It is not fun. It is monotonous and tedious to the point of nausea."", 'The basic premise is that you are a young woman whose plane has crashed on Site B, the second island from Jurassic Park, where dinosaurs still roam free. Your character, Anne, now has to roam across the island looking for some way of getting off the island or at least contacting some help. Thus begins your journey through eight levels of jungle and the occasional dinosaur.', ""Trespasser boasts a realistic and powerful physics-based engine. Knock a barrel over and it will roll and tumble according to the direction and strength of your push. But the designers went overboard with the physics. Everything is governed meticulously by the physics engine, and that complicates even the simplest puzzles needlessly. Even the most basic puzzles, such as stacking boxes to get from low to high ground, take more than a fair share of minutes to complete, as you have to be careful not to touch a box the wrong way lest you topple your carefully constructed box staircase. If you do end up inadvertently messing up your puzzle in progress, you will have to spend even more time rearranging all the boxes. Pretty soon, a puzzle that should only take half a minute has absorbed five minutes of your time. Now multiply that by the ridiculous number of box-stacking puzzles, and you arrive at hours of tedious box pushing and pulling. In many instances, you will wish that Dreamworks had abstracted portions of the game's physics."", ""The action in the game is no less aggravating. There are too many tedious tasks, and there aren't any fun things to do. Exploration is a huge bother because you run so damn slow in this game. Because the levels are expansive jungles and valleys, walking from one area to the next will take way too much time. Although, if Dreamworks sped up the running to a bearable gait, it would simply take less time to figure out the game's true nature: It is nothing but an uneventful and needless hike through a barren landscape. And if you do bother to wander around the levels, you'll find much of nothing. Just more jungle, with nothing to really hold your attention."", 'What about the dinosaurs, which, aside from the torturous physics, are this game\'s other claim to fame? There are hardly any, and the ones you see are few and far between. Along your prompted path (the half-constructed monorail system), you might run into one or two brachiosaurs or a stegosaur on occasion. As for challenging and hostile adversaries, you will run into raptors one at a time during different parts of a level. The curious thing is, John Hammond tells you that raptors are pack hunters, so why for almost the entire first half of the game do you only see one raptor at a time? (For that matter, why, when they die, no matter where or how you shot them, do they always lie down in that same position?) And didn\'t Sam Neil\'s character in Jurassic Park, in reference to the hadrosaurs and brachiosaurs in Jurassic Park, say, ""They do travel in herds""? He certainly did, so why is it that you see one lone hadrosaur at a time and at best two brachiosaurs? It\'s ridiculous. I think the early claims were for a living ecosystem, but this ecosystem barely qualifies as populated.', ""Another annoyance is that these dinosaurs don't act independently. One benefit of the Trespasser engine is a range of sight that lets you peer far into the distance. Unfortunately, it also allowed me to see that the brachiosaurs off in the distance didn't start moving until I got closer. It was like they were waiting for their cue to start acting. So much for sitting on tree branches to see this world come to life. And even when I did see dinosaurs interacting, it was in a disappointing fashion. I lured a raptor to a stegosaur, hoping to see some gory, tail-slapping action, only to witness the stegosaur try to bite the oncoming raptor. At least that's what I assume the stegosaur did, because it tried to poke its assailant with its snout. Everybody knows that a stegosaur would defend itself with its wickedly spiked tail... everybody, it seems, except the stegosaur."", 'The list goes on. There are numerous collision detection bugs. Dinosaurs crashed into each other, boxes got pushed through walls, a brachiosaur impaled itself on a few trees. Many times I walked into an area to see the resident dinosaur fall 50 feet from the sky or jump up that same distance, turn around, and then crash back to the ground.', ""The voice acting is lackluster. Minnie Driver (as the main character, Anne) can't even muster up an ounce of excitement when she sees a dinosaur for the first time (guess it's an everyday occurrence for her), and Hammond's and Anne's voice-overs sometimes make no sense. One time, at a waterfall, Anne started talking about sleeping at a bus stop and eating vending machine food. What that had to do with her stay on Site B, I don't know. It was as perplexing as the rest of this game."", ""You still want to hear more? Well, the arm looks ridiculous, and you can get it to bend in sickening ways that no human would be able to bear. It's also absolutely ludicrous the lengths the designers force you to go through to pick up an object. Yes, it's realistic, but it sure as hell isn't fun having to jut out your hand at every object and then hit two keys while maneuvering your arm to the precise point to pick it up. Half the time, I ended up pushing the object around like some drooling idiot instead of picking it up. And why couldn't Anne have scrounged for a backpack at the crash site so she could carry more than two items? Better yet, why don't your two items carry over from level to level, even though it is supposed to be a seamless level transition? You see what I mean? This game is just too frustrating, too boring, too tedious, too enamored of its vaunted physics engine. It's a good engine, if you don't consider the bugs, but it doesn't amount to much of a game.<i>--Elliott Chin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Silver,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['This adventure game, of the medieval type, has you fight with the hero David against dragons and villains.', ""Japanese-style RPGs, while popular on consoles, have been woefully underrepresented on the PC. Those few that have been released to date are mostly shareware fan efforts or no-frills console ports, Final Fantasy VII being the most notable example. Now French publisher Infogrames, in an effort to fill this void in the market, has released Silver, a purported Final Fantasy killer designed specifically for the PC. And while Silver won't unseat Final Fantasy as the reigning champion, the game is nonetheless interesting in the way it attempts to rethink some of the genre's conventions. <P> As the game begins, your alter ego David witnesses his wife's kidnapping by the minions of the evil wizard Silver, and he sets out to rescue both her and the rest of his hometown's stolen women. Helping David in the pursuit is his incredibly tough granddad called Grandad. It's a loopy, enjoyable start to the game, which is a good thing because Silver's success or failure rests almost entirely on the strength of its story. <P> Silver plays out on prerendered three-dimensional backgrounds through which you must guide polygonal characters. The environments themselves are essentially static bitmaps with a few looping animations. They look good for the most part, and some are spectacular, though everything tends to have that overly clean, computer-generated feel that Final Fantasy VII managed to avoid. The characters themselves are not particularly detailed but are especially well animated. <P> Silver's developers chose to streamline the traditional console-RPG formula by removing many of its standard elements. Thankfully, the thousands of random encounters typical to the genre are gone. Instead, most screens are stocked with monsters that must be fought once, then never again. The exits to each area are sealed during combat and reopen only when all enemies have been defeated. A few sections have regenerating creatures that reappear with each visit, but these are the exception rather than the rule. While this removes much of the tedium associated with this type of game, the finite number of available battles makes open-ended stat building virtually impossible. <P> Silver does include character stats and levels like your typical RPG but eliminates experience points completely. Instead, levels are gained by reaching key plot points and defeating boss monsters. Only a few instances exist where extra levels can be accrued out of sequence with the story, so in general, you are kept in strict parity with your foes. This tends to dilute the sense of escalating power that is a key draw of RPGs, but the discarding of an endless series of uneventful brawls makes that sacrifice more than worthwhile. <P> The fights themselves occur in real time and are very fun. Melee attacks are launched using only the control key and the mouse, with various mouse movements resulting in different thrusts and slashes. This feature could have become a cumbersome bore, but the number of moves is kept to a reasonable five, and each has its own clear use. Once the control is mastered - and it doesn't take long - the battles become both more exciting and more tactical than your average turn-based fare, which, strategic pretensions aside, tend to degenerate into attack, heal, repeat. Since you're free to move around each environment, positional advantage becomes a big factor, and many of the battles are staged as sort of minipuzzles wherein landscape features must be utilized to win the skirmish. <P> While things may look bleak in the land of Jarrah, everything seems to be pretty great in the actual playing of the game. At least at first. Like many console RPGs, Silver's story unfolds completely linearly for the first few hours before opening up somewhat. Grandad accompanies you throughout this beginning section. He is controlled by the computer and is generally pretty helpful. Later in the game, you're saddled with up to two companions whom you must control yourself. <P> This wouldn't be so bad if they were as intelligently autonomous as Grandad, but you're expected to directly control everyone. Unfortunately, such a plan is utterly incompatible with the game's arcade-like combat system. Unless you've got unusually evolved hand-eye coordination, you'll eventually end up using one character to kill everything while the other two stand motionless as monsters hit them on the head with clubs. It's true that you can select all the characters at once, at which point the secondary heroes become marginally effective. But the flaw in this strategy is that everyone then tends to clump together and, in the mouse-clicking frenzy of battle, you'll accidentally click on just one character and break the grouping, returning the remaining combatants to passive-observer status. You can direct the unused characters to stand back and fire their ranged weapons, but this is nothing more than a quick way to deplete your ammo. And instead of noting this problem and properly addressing it, the developers seem to simply kludge it by having any dead companion automatically return to life after each battle. <P> Silver's story is an equally big problem, although it starts out strong. Each game character actually speaks his dialogue. Bucking the trend of having friends of the programmers provide the voice talent, Infogrames has hired what appear to be professional actors, and they do a uniformly good job. Unfortunately, the plot soon devolves into a typical tale of magic-orb fetching and simply runs out of surprises long before the end. This is a critical flaw in a game that has consciously pared away many of the gameplay elements, annoying or not, that compose the bulk of other entries in the field. <P> Silver is simplified by the removal or retooling of much of the complex stat-based baggage of its console RPG brethren. It's a good idea that almost works. Every element starts off strong, only to reveal its weakness as the game progresses. Infogrames has come close to successfully creating a new subgenre - one based on enjoyable fast-action battles mixed with rich story. It's fun while it lasts, and even if you find yourself unmotivated to complete the entire quest, you'll at least enjoy the ride to the halfway point.<i>--Erik Wolpaw</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

NBA Live '99 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<i>NBA Live '99</i> marks the return of the popular NBA simulation game, featuring new player facial animations, chatter, and celebrations after big plays. Choose from a variety of modes and styles to set up a game with the ultimate NBA realism, or pick up and play with Arcade mode. From the opening tip to the final buzzer, NBA Live 99 delivers great hoops gameplay and realistic player graphics."", 'So you\'re sitting on your couch, trying to will the regular season rematch between the Bulls and Jazz into existence by staring at the television set. Well, I have news for you, it\'s not going to happen. The 1998-99 NBA season is all but dead. But I have one thing to say to that: So what? You can start your own NBA season. Who needs greedy players and owners? EA Sports\' NBA Live 99 lets you simulate as many seasons as you like of fast-paced, all-out hoops action, without the whining, the high-priced players, or the strangled coaches. <P> EA Sports\' NBA Live series has always been a winner, and this year is no different. The game isn\'t fundamentally different, so if you\'ve played previous NBA Lives, the 99 version will be a familiar experience. However, that\'s not to say that NBA Live 99 isn\'t full of surprises and improvements. Live 99 takes the series to the next level, with great new graphics and more gameplay options. <P> This year\'s NBA Live looks better than ever. The 3Dfx graphics are incredible, and the new 3D faces and facial animation are uncannily similar to the players\' real faces. You\'ll recognize each player instantly: Shaq looks like Shaq, and Sprewell looks like Sprewell. Players also sport new facial animation. You\'ll see players yawning, wincing in pain after an injury, screaming during a big dunk, or wagging their tongue on the way to the basket. Players also liven it up after a dunk or nice layup, jumping up in celebration, pumping their fists in the air, or even pointing at the opposing players for some ""trash"" pointing. You\'ll also notice more differentiation between players when you play the game. I played a game between the Golden State Warriors and LA Lakers and saw that Shaq was nearly twice the size of Muggsy Bogues. I played as the Lakers against the Utah Jazz and saw that Hornicek was a virtual stick next to Shaq\'s wide body. These new facial expressions, 3D faces, and the varying body types make this NBA Live the most visually realistic and impressive of all basketball games. <P> The graphics aren\'t perfect though. While the animation and player motion is for the most part smooth and lifelike, there are times when players stutter or get caught against each other. After a brief moment of shaking, the players will again move into their regular patterns and movement, but the momentary lapse is jarring to the otherwise beautiful virtual reality this game\'s graphics create. During replays, I was a bit bothered by the inarticulate hands, which don\'t show enough motion during the dunk. But this is really a very minor point and shouldn\'t detract from the game\'s great graphics. <P> There are some new features for NBA Live 99, the most prominent being a new practice mode and multiple-seasons play. The practice mode is a pretty cool feature, but it could stand much improvement. I would have liked to see a button list like those furnished by today\'s fighting games like Tekken 3. With all the new fakes and dunks, it\'s hard to read a manual, memorize everything, and then try to perform the moves. An option to see a move list onscreen with appropriate buttons would have been invaluable. I also wanted to be able to practice with a teammate for passes, assists, and two-player moves. A practice mode with a player on defense (like a one-on-one game) would also have been great for testing out those fakes and dekes. It\'s easy to fake out nobody, so how do you know if your fakes will really work on an actual player in a game? <P> The new multiple-seasons play allows you to build a team completely from scratch through the draft and then play for ten seasons. You can build a dynasty by trading for players and try to outdo the Bulls. Players will age during those ten seasons, either improving with experience or declining in old age. I don\'t know that I would play ten seasons of 82 games each, at the full 12 minutes per quarter, but the option is there. Of course, you can also specify 32- or 54-game seasons and adjust quarter time from two minutes to 12 minutes, just as you could in previous NBA Lives, so even those of us with less time can try our hand at dynasty building. <P> As always, NBA Live allows you to play in arcade mode, where all the rules don\'t apply, and simulation mode, where the game takes on the intensity and challenge of the real game. However, this year\'s arcade mode is even wilder, with high-flying, slow-motion dunks and even faster-paced play. There are no flaming basketballs, NBA Jam-style, but this is a good mode for a fast arcade fix. Simulation mode seems to have toughened up this year. Playing on superstar difficulty was a great challenge. As the LA Lakers, I lost to the Phoenix Suns by 30 points, and that was in a 16-minute game. The computer makes better use of the clock, takes advantage of mismatches on defense, and really moves the ball between players a lot better. It also steals and blocks more aggressively, and successfully, in superstar mode. Of course, there are two, less masochistic, difficulty settings. They aren\'t quite as tough as superstar mode, but they have all the rules of the NBA and pose a challenge. Teams and players will perform as you\'d expect. There might be the odd occurrence, like Hornicek missing two free throws, but I chalk those up to the randomness of the game\'s calculations. For the most part, teams that suck will suck, and players that rock will consistently post MVP-like numbers. Gameplay has also been tweaked some so that losing AI players don\'t constantly foul in the final minutes, which essentially gives the already winning team a chance for two more points. <P> When you strip away all the great new graphics and new season play, the core of the game is still great fun. NBA Live 99 is a fantastic game to play with others, especially on the same screen, where you can trash-talk after a monster dunk (hotseat, modem, and LAN play are supported). The game is still fast and fun basketball action, with some coaching options for making substitutions and calling play guidelines, but when the rock is in your hands, it\'s just you, the basket, and your hoop dreams.

Also, a full-featured mission editor lets them create custom battles and share them with fellow <I>Armored Fist 3</I> players.<P> Perhaps the biggest gripe with <I>Armored Fist 3</I> is Novalogic's Voxel Space 32 engine, which eschews the use of the latest 3-D accelerators. Though the software engine supports a dazzling 16 million colors, you'll need at least the minimum requirements just to play at an enjoyable speed, and a much more powerful machine to enjoy <I>Armored Fist 3</I> at the highest graphical detail. --<i>Doug Radcliffe</i>"", 'Why would a game publisher release two sequels to an armored combat simulation that didn\'t have much going for it in the first place? Did it hope the third time\'s the charm? Or is it three strikes and you\'re out? When NovaLogic\'s original Armored Fist came out five years ago, it wasn\'t a bad game, but it didn\'t really deserve a sequel. Nonetheless, in 1997, NovaLogic followed up with Armored Fist 2, which received a lukewarm response. They\'ve now released Armored Fist 3, a game that claims to be a simulation of the US Army\'s M1A2 main battle tank. Aside from 50 new scripted missions, four new linear campaigns, the inclusion of foot infantry, and the souped-up Voxel Space 32 graphics engine (which doesn\'t use 3D hardware acceleration), it\'s difficult to see how Armored Fist 3 is much different from its predecessor. It certainly offers little in the way of improved gameplay. <P> Having played the first two games, I can\'t help but wonder why NovaLogic bothered with the third. It appears that little, if anything, has been done to improve the game\'s AI in the past five years. Armored Fist 3 retains problems that dogged the original game, such as an autotargeting system that locks on to the least threatening targets at the worst possible times and attack helicopters flown by pilots with death wishes. <P> In the second game, NovaLogic attempted to appease those who hated the autotargeting system by including a more realistic gunnery option that let you select your own targets, then lay and fire the gun. That was great, except that as campaigns became more difficult, it was less and less practical to use manual gunnery. Amazingly enough, the same unworkable manual targeting option that was in Armored Fist 2 is also in Armored Fist 3 with no changes whatsoever. No matter how much you want to avoid using the lamebrained autotargeting method, you\'re practically forced to use it when you begin facing the hordes of enemies thrown at you to mask the game\'s horrid AI. It\'s the only way you can target and kill enemy units fast enough to remain alive. <P> Considering the lack of 3D acceleration, what is achieved with this graphics engine is surprising. However, since the game runs at a maximum resolution of 640 x 480, it makes you wonder how much longer NovaLogic can ride this aging horse. It\'s not as if this engine lets slower computers play the game. With all the detail settings maxed out, my Pentium III 450 slowed noticeably when the action became intense, forcing me to turn off some options to maintain a smooth frame rate. <P> Perhaps NovaLogic is banking on the game\'s multiplayer support to give the Armored Fist series new legs. Up to 32 players can participate in a mission over the Internet via NovaLogic\'s free NovaWorld game servers. Unfortunately, this is the only multiplayer option available. There\'s no support for LANs, modem play, or one-on-one Internet play. You can either play against the AI or play on NovaWorld. Period. <P> At least there are plenty of multiplayer options on NovaWorld. You can play games either cooperatively or against others individually or as a team. You can host a public game or one locked with a password. NovaWorld provides deathmatches, team deathmatches, platoon-versus-platoon battles, and capture-the-flag matches. Currently, the preferred styles of play on NovaWorld are team deathmatches and capture the flag. <P> There are two advantages to playing multiplayer games on NovaWorld. NovaLogic says that its system provides for smoother and more reliable play. While this appears to be mostly true, I did see occasional problems with lagging and warping. There were also instances in which I could not reconnect with NovaWorld after temporarily leaving it minutes earlier. Gameplay can slow to a crawl when you operate your tanks\' smoke generators, which most players do to help avoid being hit. <P> The second advantage of NovaWorld is the ability to use Armored Fist 3\'s Voice-Over-Net technology. If you have a headset equipped with a microphone, and your computer has a full duplex sound card, you can play while talking to other members of your team. But many Armored Fist 3 players avoid using this feature and seem to prefer sending messages the old-fashioned way - by typing. <P> As someone unfamiliar with voice communication over the Internet, I found it somewhat difficult to get my system properly configured to take advantage of this feature. And once I could send and receive voice messages, sometimes what I heard was unintelligible because players don\'t always bother to properly adjust their microphone levels. <P> Of course, not everyone will appreciate online battles that consistently degenerate into wild tank melees, whether they can talk to each other or not. In multiplayer mode, there\'s little time for planning strategy or devising tactics. You simply throw your tank into the fray and blast away at point-blank range. In fact, the online version of Armored Fist 3 is a simplified version of the single-player game in which you have no choice but to use autotargeting. <P> NovaLogic calls Armored Fist 3 an ""action-oriented simulation,"" but it\'s really just an action game disguised as a simulation. As a single-player game, it\'s outdated, and as a multiplayer game, it lacks the variety to provide long-term enjoyment. Not even the cool Voice-Over-Net feature can rescue this game from mediocrity.<i>--Patrick C. Miller</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Wing Commander: Prophecy - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['This installment of the Wing Commander series features a new space combat engine for unequaled visual excitement and tactical realism, a new and terrifying alien menace, a new story line that begins the next chapter in the series, new graphics, and a hard-edged soundtrack.', ""For the fifth chapter in Origin's space-combat series, the designers have abandoned the game's recent tendency toward the cinematic. The last two Wing Commander chapters have seen gameplay give way to lengthy expository film sequences, with missions often seeming like no more than a way to kill time until the next big plot point. Not any more. With original series creator Chris Roberts gone to head up Digital Anvil (and reportedly direct the Wing Commander film), the new design team has shifted the emphasis from screenplay to gameplay, and the result is an engaging, but somewhat different, Wing Commander experience. <P> Why different? Primarily because the shift away from FMV has been accompanied by a shift away from plot in general, a significant departure for a series that has been associated with some of the most intricate and gripping storylines in recent gaming memory. It's true that the game introduces a new crew of characters, and some old favorites - such as Blair and Maniac, played by Mark Hamill and Tom Wilson, respectively - are still around. And there's a new alien species invading Confederation territory, wreaking havoc on the crippled Kilrathi (who were all but annihilated over the course of the first three games) and bent on destroying everything in its path. The modest attempts to develop these characters aren't very interesting, and the plot is largely devoid of the types of intrigue and surprise we've come to expect from the Wing Commander series. The game also lacks significant dialogue choices to make, and hence, storyline branches. Prophecy is almost totally linear, with only one or two minor exceptions based on mission performance. <P> All this means that Wing Commander: Prophecy stands or falls based on its gameplay. Fortunately it stands up quite well. As rookie Confed pilot Lance Casey, your role is simple and straightforward: Work your way up the ranks of Confed pilots by taking out as many alien targets as you humanly can. Encounters with the aliens are the most fascinating aspect of the game - thanks in large measure to designer Syd Mead, whose previous work includes production design for Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. Mead has crafted a menacing, insect-like alien race, piloting ships that look like, behave like, and are even named after sea-creatures. Even better, the invaders dart and dodge through space, with a distinctly different flare than opponents from earlier chapters in the series. <P> Most of the missions center around simply destroying as many of these aquatic-like craft as possible. There's a heavy emphasis on patrol missions, in which you fly from one Nav point to the next fighting any enemies encountered along the way, but there are a few really brilliant missions strewn throughout the game. You'll take out massive cruisers and transports, and you'll encounter immense battleships armed with devastating weapons. The last mission is particularly notable - it makes the rest of the game worthwhile, truly creating a sense of suspense as you desperately try to achieve your final objectives against overwhelming odds. It's also possible to fail many of the missions and still continue - though your next sortie will be made a little more difficult as a result. <P> Undoubtedly, some will find a few of the mission conventions a little frustrating. Except in rare cases, you no longer get to choose your ship, and you never get to choose your wingmen or your weapons loadout. But this adds a welcome challenge, as you can't always rely upon the best combination. It should also be mentioned that many of the missions are quite lengthy and there's no way to incrementally save your game. While that fact alone isn't too much of a problem, it is a problem when the designers string two of these missions together without giving you a chance to save in between. It may heighten the drama, but it occasionally escalates the frustration. <P> But even with these quirks, this game is difficult to stop playing, and for one simple reason: Wing Commander: Prophecy is one of the finest looking games ever created. Along with Quake II, it may be the only reason you need to justify purchasing a 3D accelerator. While the nonaccelerated version is quite nice, the accelerated version is downright awe-inspiring. The bleak black space of previous chapters has been replaced by a more visually dazzling backdrop, filled with colorful gasses and treacherous asteroids. The ships contain an amazing amount of detail and the explosions - not your basic fireballs mind you, but huge rings of light and hurtling debris - are incredible. The flight engine, while still very familiar, has been improved, especially in terms of raw speed. <P> The only real problem with Wing Commander: Prophecy is that it ends too soon. And as a result of the linear storyline and lack of multiplayer support, this is not a game you'll be returning to over and over. You'll long for a little more substance once you've finished, but the engaging gameplay, solid mission design, and mesmerizing visuals make Wing Commander: Prophecy a blast while it lasts. <i>--Ron Dulin</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Nox - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<I>Nox</I> is a dark and creepy Action/RPG, set in a bucolic world corrupted by Hecubah, a wicked queen of the undead. In solo play, choose from three different adventures. Follow the path of a warrior, and you will forge your skills and master powerful weapons in the Fortress of Horrendous. Join the ranks of the conjurers in the village of Ix and learn to summon the creatures of the land and control the forces of nature. Or lead the life of a wizard, and use combat magic, stealth, and traps to foil the undead legions.', ""After the remarkable commercial success of Blizzard's Diablo, it's surprising that it has taken three years for the predictable wave of similar games to arrive. Perhaps even more surprising is that, unlike the slew of real-time strategy clones that followed Warcraft II and Command & Conquer, most of the Diablo clones have actually proven to be quality games, and Westwood's Nox certainly continues that trend. While few elements in Nox are entirely novel, Westwood has created a polished game that provides both challenging and entertaining single-player campaigns and fast-paced multiplayer battlegrounds. <P>Nox's isometric graphical perspective and action/role-playing hybrid gameplay are unquestionably reminiscent of Diablo, but Nox provides a more action-oriented experience. Character movement is quick, and combat is very fast paced. There are no ethical codes to adhere to unlike in some traditional RPGs. You can't attack characters who aren't enemies, but if the game lets you destroy an object, slaughter a creature, or pilfer a nonplayer character's possessions, then you can rest assured that it's the right thing to do. Since causing chaos isn't penalized, action is almost constant as your character frantically runs through levels, smashing objects and dispatching monsters or other players. <P>Nox provides a separate single-player campaign for each of the three distinct character classes, as well as a slew of multiplayer game options. Multiplayer Nox is a pure action game that features respawning items, quick player kills, and geographically limited arenas; it's completely devoid of character development and nonplayer characters or monsters, other than those you summon. The gameplay in multiplayer Nox is closer in style to an isometric, swords-and-sorcery version of Quake than it is to Diablo. <P>The single-player campaigns feature a few additional role-playing elements, as your character will acquire experience points and solve simple quests, but the gameplay emphasis remains on action. The campaigns are linear and level-based, so there's no way to personalize your experience other than through your choice of attire and armaments. Surprisingly, there are also no difficulty settings, so you must be adept at coping with occasionally frantic action to complete the campaigns. Fortunately, Nox features a remarkably intuitive and effective interface that uses well-placed hotkeys to let you quickly change weapons or access available spells and abilities. There's never been a more efficient interface in such a game. <P>Each of the single-player campaigns is different, although characters travel through most of the same areas and have the same overall quest. Since each of the three character classes has significantly different abilities, the campaigns play out differently even when you're exploring familiar territory. While a wizard character can peacefully stroll through the wizard's stronghold, a warrior character will be immediately attacked. The uninspired story involves a dislocated trailer-trash youth assembling a multicomponent artifact and stomping undead hordes led by a maniacal necromancer queen. The campaigns are saturated with brief but entertaining scripted sequences that play out using the game's engine. Westwood has a penchant for adding goofy humor into its RPGs, and the buffoonery partially compensates for the plot's lack of originality. There are even a few laugh-out-loud moments, such as an amusing scene early in one of the campaigns when an expected showdown with a formidable nemesis is prematurely cut short in comical Raiders of the Lost Ark fashion. <P>Nox's most distinctive features are its method for handling line of sight and its interactive environments. The trademark TrueSight line-of-sight system blacks out areas of the gaming world behind trees or other obstacles that your character couldn't reasonably see beyond. The effect isn't revolutionary, since 1983's Ultima III featured a rudimentary version of a similar system, and the result can be more distracting than interesting. However, it definitely gives Nox its own look, and it's easy to adjust to using the onscreen automap function if you require navigational assistance. <P>Nox's levels are also littered with moveable objects, such as bones, barrels, and furniture. Occasionally you must use those objects to solve puzzles - pushing a barrel of water to drown a fire or to press a pressure plate, for instance - but usually the objects are just there to be smashed or hurled wildly across the room as they're struck by an explosive spell effect. A lot of attention to detail went into Nox's level design, as dwellings are logically decorated with appropriate objects, and subterranean lairs look suitably homey for their troll inhabitants. <P>The artificial intelligence of the monsters and nonplayer characters in Nox's campaigns is generally excellent. Occasionally, you'll meet NPCs who will ally with your character for the duration of a level. You'll have no control whatsoever over these characters, but they'll capably follow your character and engage any enemies you encounter. Conjurer characters can also summon or charm creatures that will loyally carry out basic commands until they are killed or banished. There are a couple of memorable siege levels where a town or stronghold is attacked, and you can acquire a whole flock of allies to fight the waves of intruders. Since the AI is generally so good, it's especially disappointing that there's no way to cooperatively complete Nox's campaigns with other players. <P>The only notable AI flaw is that enemies at extreme visibility range won't react until they're attacked. Since there's a variety of spells and weapons that either kill enemies instantly or do massive damage, you can avoid some of the most challenging battles by advancing slowly and picking off the immobile enemies as soon as they become visible. Like Grandma used to say, nothing clears a path better than a gigantic Fist of Vengeance or death ray. <P>Early in its development, Nox was designed primarily as a multiplayer game, and the multiplayer level design is excellent. Multiplayer characters possess all of their class's available abilities and spells (other than those removed for gameplay balance), which makes the deathmatch, capture the flag, and other exotic multiplayer game types included with Nox more tactical than they typically are in first-person shooters. Still, multiplayer Nox may not experience the longevity that more visceral first-person-perspective games have enjoyed. But since each of the three character classes has such different abilities, the single-player campaigns certainly provide a lot of value, especially since they feature unique endings and quests. <P>It's probably unfair to simply categorize Nox as a Diablo clone since the game had been in development limbo for years prior to its acquisition by Westwood. Westwood acquired the orphaned Nox following the dissolution of Virgin Interactive's US gaming division, and the company has done a great job finalizing the game for release. Even though the game could likely have been released several months ago, the additional attention to detail put into the game since then has resulted in a streamlined interface, solid single-player campaigns and, overall, a considerably more polished product. Even the installation program is almost as interesting as the great one that shipped with the original Command & Conquer. <P>Nox could easily have been a game with a few original ideas that devolved into a hastily developed, derivative, and uninteresting clone. Instead, the developers have taken the necessary time to create a unique and polished game that offers different and enjoyable single- and multiplayer experiences. -- <i>Desslock</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc.

Shadow Company: Left for Dead - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['This real-time tactical action game lets you take over command of an elite force of mercenaries. This begins with saving the remains of the unit, abandoned by its headquarters after being ambushed during a mission in Angola. You must finish the mission and get your handful of survivors out of the country to start rebuilding the unit, find out what happened, and eventually take revenge on those that abandoned your men. Manage a mercenary company, from supplies to recruitment, and rebuild your unit into a force worthy of respect.', ""Control up to eight mercenaries at a time in an intense, highly playable, and addictive game. The gorgeous graphics and the lively characters fully immerse the player into his team's struggle for survival and revenge. The realistic situations and challenging missions make this game a must for fans of real-time strategy and tactics. At the same time, the intuitive interface and awesome graphics allow any player to truly enjoy the experience."", 'The word ""great"" all too easily finds its way into game reviews. Great graphics, great gameplay, great multiplayer support - let\'s face it, the word great is greatly overused. Shadow Company: Left for Dead is one of those rare games that truly merits the word - but probably not in the way its developers envisioned. In fact, this real-time tactical combat game from Ubi Soft and Sinister Games falls into the dreaded category of games that aren\'t but should have been... you guessed it - great. Unfortunately, Shadow Company\'s horrific controls and camera angles, its abbreviated single-player campaign, and its bizarre gameplay glitches all hamper what could easily have been one of the year\'s best games.', ""Much like the Jagged Alliance games from Sirtech, Shadow Company puts you in command of a small squad of mercenaries. You begin the game with only a three-man force, left for dead (hence the subtitle) after a botched operation in Angola. You must first complete your original assignment with limited troops and equipment and then escape to a safe extraction point before the game's main campaign begins in earnest."", ""The game offers a brief nine-mission single-player campaign, though each of the missions involves a dizzying array of objectives. You are often called upon to complete five or six seemingly unrelated tasks - rescue a prisoner and blow up a submarine, for example - against enormous odds. Often, you'll find dozens of enemy soldiers guarding and patrolling your target area. Fortunately, you have a very impressive arsenal at your disposal."", 'With the money you make from successful missions, you can hire new mercs and buy new equipment. Weapons include handguns, submachine guns, assault weapons, and sniper rifles, as well as grenades, knives, and bazookas. You can also stock up on body armor, night-vision goggles, medical kits, and all that other stuff a good mercenary army needs in the field.', ""Unlike in the Jagged Alliance games, all the action in Shadow Company unfolds in real-time, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it gives the game a Rainbow Six-like feel, where you run your troops through dazzling 3D environments without having to worry about movement points and such. However, it can be tough keeping tabs on all your troops - and unlike in Rainbow Six, you don't have any mission plans or AI group commanders to help you out in Shadow Company. Technically, you can command up to eight mercenaries at a time, but controlling as many as four can be a daunting task, so you'll want to make very sure you need the extra manpower before hiring additional soldiers."", 'Most of the trouble with Shadow Company can be tracked to a single, glaring flaw: the camera controls. Your view of the action is similar to the camerawork in Bungie\'s Myth games. All the mission environments are impressively rendered in 3D, and you have a bird\'s-eye view of everything. You can pan the camera using the numeric keypad or the mouse, as well as rotate and change the elevation. All of this is rather straightforward, but because the game does a terrible job of centering on your units, you spend most of your time struggling with the camera to get a clear view of the terrain around your troops. Even when you choose to center on a specific merc, once you begin rotating the camera, your view seems to spiral farther and farther away from its focus, leaving you with a distant and nearly useless viewing angle. When you click on the ""track object"" option, the camera moves in a jerky, headache-inducing motion, which renders this option just as useless.', ""What's more, the game's 3D engine suffers from bizarre polygonal clipping and object-overlapping issues that seriously affect gameplay. For starters, every object appears to block out everything behind it, even when the foreground object is transparent. For example, even when you can see one of your units through the branches of a tree, you cannot select the merc without first rotating the camera to get a clear view of him. Often, you can't even target or select a unit behind a chain-link fence. And when using the game's sniper mode, you typically cannot squeeze off a shot when aiming through foliage - even when you have a bad guy lined up perfectly in your sights."", ""The first-person sniper mode also calls attention to another oddity. When aiming in this mode, your crosshairs turn red when you have a clean shot. However, the crosshair movement is somewhat jerky, as if you're moving through a series of grid points rather than a fluid 3D space. As a result, the perfect shot is often lined up well off the target's body, which is extremely confusing. Accordingly, when you line up what appears to be a perfect shot, with the crosshairs right on a bad guy's chest or head, your shot will almost always miss. Even worse, your sniper will occasionally refuse to squeeze the trigger, even when you have an obvious target. The same thing often happens with grenades, in fact - your merc won't throw it when you tell him to."", ""Even one of the game's best features, the mercs' ability to drive vehicles, isn't as good as it could have been. While it's undeniably cool to climb aboard a boat, a Hummer, or a snowmobile and drive it around the 3D terrain, the steering controls are awkward and cumbersome, mostly on account of the camera-angle problems. Why the game doesn't automatically place the camera above and directly behind your vehicle is a total mystery. As it stands, you have to drive your vehicle with the arrow keys while constantly updating the camera angle with the keypad."", ""Shadow Company isn't really a bad game. In fact, it is a very good game marred by some very bad design decisions. As such, it has its highlights. Its 3D graphics are excellent, including wonderfully detailed and realistic terrain, and its sound effects are similarly top-notch. Its music is also good, though it sounds remarkably like the tunes from the original Jagged Alliance. Last but not least, Shadow Company has a decent multiplayer component that allows up to eight players to take on the game's nine missions over IPX or IP connections."", ""Shadow Company has plenty going for it and will likely find a warm place in the hearts of some strategy gamers. But it is unlikely that the average real-time strategy player will have the patience to deal with this game's significant shortcomings. --<i>Michael E. Ryan</i><br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Tomb Raider - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Lara Croft, the protagonist in Tomb Raider, has become a sort of unwitting spokesperson for Eidos\' new computer adventure. As the cover girl for just about every hard copy gaming magazine this year, this globe-trotting, gun-happy lass had become the matron saint of a new revolution in 3D gaming before the title even hit the shelves. But does the game really live up to all the buildup? Well, seeing is believing when it comes to Tomb Raider, and playing the game with the Rendition or 3Dfx chip, which are sure to find a home soon in every serious gamer\'s computer tower (a supportive patch will be available online for these), should almost be a prerequisite. Featuring several stunningly rendered 3D worlds and many a cliff-hanging moment, Tomb Raider makes gamers pay for the whole seat, even though they only need the edge. <P> As mentioned above, in Tomb Raider you play Lara Croft, a female Doc Savage who, tired of her wealthy English upbringing, has decided that dangerous adventuring is more her cup of tea. So she abandons a life of crustless cucumber sandwiches and piano lessons, eventually meeting a wealthy tycoon who hires her to retrieve a single artifact from a ruined temple in South America. After getting the artifact, you find out that the tycoon has sicked a bunch of her henchmen on you, and that the original piece you were sent in to retrieve is one of three hidden in various unplundered tombs around the world. <P> Your adventures take place in several ""seven wonders"" scenarios, from Egyptian sphinxes, to Greek temples, to Atlantis (what game would be complete without it?), each with distinct puzzles and traps to negotiate. <P> In each level, you\'ll have to beware of the different predator animals, unidentifiable creatures, and henchmen lurking around. In many instances, you\'ll be pounced on unexpectedly by wolves, lions, gorillas, raptors, and gangling ""lava-monsters."" Lara has to execute daring rolls, jumps, and side-leaps to dodge these predators while attacking them. This is no time to join the wildlife preservation society; endangered species or not, you\'ve got to slay these pests. Sometimes, at the end of a level, you\'ll have to go up against of the ""boss"" monsters, which range from a lumbering Tyranosaur to a huge ""torso-man"" who, if he snatches you with his giant mitts, will slam you around like a rag doll. <P> So, you\'re asking, what weapons can I use on these poor crypt-dwellers who are simply trying to sustain themselves in a sealed-up tomb? With a tap of the spacebar, Lara draws out her two revolvers which automatically target any man-eating creature in the vicinity. Other more effective weapons are picked up throughout the game, including a set of magnums, a shotgun, and an Uzi. Rounds for your default weapon are unlimited, but ammo for the other weapons has to be picked up. <P> But killing is only half the fun in Tomb Raider, as Lara can perform a variety of actions to explore each eerie environment. Often you\'ll have to make Lara swim through convoluted caves to secret rooms (incidentally, this is some of the most realistic swimming movement you\'ll encounter in any game). Each level has a series of switches that you need to activate, some of which require you to heave huge blocks around and - this is probably the most fun part of the game - execute daredevil leaps to grab onto some faraway platform. <P> Tomb Raider is the exploratory game you always wished you were playing when you were trying to solve Atari Raiders of the Lost Ark.The variety of jumping and grabbing actions, the huge, sometimes vertigo-inducing worlds, and the smooth 3D graphics found in Tomb Raider are reminiscent of Mario 64, though the game\'s violent overtones and spooky ambiance definitely set it apart from the older title. On the down side though, some of Tomb Raider\'s puzzles are tedious, requiring the player to wander around a little bit too long. Graphically, it\'s a breakthrough game, but to obtain the spellbinding graphics that really make the gameplay a complete experience, you\'ll need one of the cards mentioned above. The avid 3D game enthusiast will probably shell out the extra bucks for one, especially if Quake is a resident game on her machine.<i>--Tim Soete</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

(Not suitable for players under 17 years of age)"", ""South Park Rally is the third South Park-licensed game, and it's terrible, just like the first two. It's a simplistic racing game that successfully captures the look and style of the show, but its gameplay is so flawed and so unenjoyable that the end result actually seems like a practical joke at the buyer's expense. South Park Rally looks and sounds deceptively good. Beware: If you didn't know any better, you might think the quality of the graphics, and how well they capture the cardboard-cutout look of the television show, are suggestive of the overall quality of the game. You'll instantly recognize all the various characters in South Park Rally if you've seen them in the show before; their simple forms and clean, flat colors come across perfect, and their faces animate just as expressively as they do on TV. Each character drives his own unique little vehicle, from Chef's wood-paneled station wagon to Officer Barbrady's cop car, often complete with a personalized license plate. The tracks in the game also look quite good; they're holiday-themed, and look just like sets from the show. Then again, it's not like South Park is best known for the high quality of its visual style; as such, the best that can be said for South Park Rally's presentation is that it looks like the show. By any other standards, the game's simple 3D shapes and flat lighting effects would be merely average. In addition, although South Park Rally does feature original dialogue by the South Park cast, there isn't nearly enough variety to the sound effects, and they're poorly sampled on top of that. For example, the game's announcer speaks far too loudly compared with the other characters, and some of the other speech in South Park Rally is incomprehensibly muffled. The game's twangy and dissonant soundtrack is reminiscent of the show's signature title track, and it'll grate on your nerves as you keep listening to it over and over, unless the other elements of the game get to you first. It wouldn't seem as necessary to point out the relatively minor problems with South Park Rally's graphics and sound if the game actually played well. However, it plays so terribly that its other problems end up standing out even more. South Park Rally is supposed to be a fun and simple racing game just like so many other go-kart-racing games out there. Just like so many other kart-racing games, South Park Rally lets you drive around or across a circuit while picking up power-ups that are designed to sway the race in your favor. The power-ups include rats, Cheesy Poofs, and more. However, most of the power-ups are utterly worthless aside from their comic value; some work like landmines, which you must drop blindly, as you have no rearview mirror, let alone any onscreen indication that a rival car is coming up from behind. Some of the other power-ups are much too inaccurate to be of any real use. But the real problem lies with your computer opponents, who recover from your attacks easily and carry on around the track with unstoppable resolve; yet if you're on the receiving end of one of their weapons, you may as well start over because you're never going to catch up. In addition, the game's open-ended track design means that you can easily get stuck or lost, and if you lose so much as a second of time, you've lost the race. South Park Rally is entirely unforgiving - you need perfect driving skills and a lot of luck to finish first, and unless you finish first you can't advance to the next stage. The game's driving mechanics are grossly simplistic - all you do is press a button to powerslide around corners - and the game's sprawling track design, which features hidden shortcuts and items that you don't actually have any time to find, is completely irritating. Maybe all the glaring problems and misguided design decisions in South Park Rally are deliberate; it's difficult to explain or justify its lack of a difficulty setting and a save-game feature otherwise. South Park Rally isn't necessarily impossible to win, but it seems intentionally designed to be impossible to tolerate for very long. There's no point playing it against the computer since you'll keep losing, yet you have no option to save and a limited option to continue. And there's no point playing it against your friends, thanks to the bad track design and ill-conceived power-ups; there's not even a draw in trying all the different characters, since all of them control exactly the same. Maybe South Park Rally is a self-conscious work of comedic genius that we'll praise one day for its blatant defiance of every convention, much like the irreverent show that inspired it. Or maybe not; it's more likely that South Park Rally is actually nothing more than a blatant attempt to quickly and greedily cash in on a still-successful but waning franchise. It's an utterly terrible game and Acclaim's third strike with the South Park license. <I>--Greg Kasavin </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Omikron: The Nomad Soul - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The planet is going through a terrible glacial era, and the extinction of its only sun has rendered all life on the surface of Phaenon impossible. In order to survive the eternal night and permanently freezing temperatures, the population has taken shelter in five cities, each encased in a crystal dome. <P> At the time of your arrival in this universe, a gigantic central computer known as Ix presides over the city of Omikron. In its virtually infinite memory are concentrated all of the data from the entire galaxy, collected by its numerous sensors. Using this information, Ix is better able to manage the interests of the human race. But Astaroth, prince of the demons, has bigger plans. He secretly seizes the Ix computer and swears his revenge. He vows to conquer not only this planet, but also spread his reign over the entire universe, to avenge himself of those who chased him away.', ""Omikron combines several types of gameplay with limited success. It's a 3D third-person adventure game with one-on-one fighting and shooting sequences, and because none of its three play elements are central, each seems shallow and serves only to provide a break from the other two at any given moment. <P>Although Omikron is a good-looking game by most standards, its attempt to convey a seamless alternate reality falls flat. Its colorful 3D graphics are fairly detailed, and its populace looks distinct, but Omikron's lofty vision warrants a much better treatment. Most of the city looks like your usual postindustrial science-fiction cityscape - it has nothing you haven't seen before in some other science-fiction game or movie. Omikron's just lots of big buildings, shiny cars, droning civilians, and flying ships, and all these things quickly start to look alike and do nothing more than reduce your frame rate to a crawl whenever you're outside. In addition, the character animation is mostly stilted and unrealistic, and the game's hand-to-hand combat sequences look silly, especially compared with the 3D fighting games Omikron attempts to emulate. <P>Fortunately, there isn't too much fighting in Omikron; more often, you'll be investigating the city and talking to its denizens. These conversation sequences, which cut from the game's standard third-person perspective to first-person close-up shots, feature detailed 3D characters that look really good. They emote realistically and actually seem to act their parts, while their unblinking eyes and shifting facial features lend an unusual puppetlike appearance that isn't unattractive. <P>Good voice acting also helps bring Omikron's key characters to life. However, the game's much-ballyhooed soundtrack provided by legendary musician David Bowie and collaborator Reeves Gabrels isn't as good as you might expect. It lacks variety and matches the city's nondescript futuristic appearance with similarly forgettable techno. A few new Bowie songs are also part of Omikron's score and are effective if extraneous as Bowie's in-game alter ego performs them in concert, in-game. Regrettably, Omikron doesn't sound good at all notwithstanding its high-profile soundtrack. Its sound effects are either over-sampled, as with the main character's too-loud footsteps, or far too subdued, as with the game's irritating first-person shooter sequences. -- <i>Greg Kasavin</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Gameplay revolves around six distinct campaigns, each divided into individual missions. Play is somewhat linear (with exceptions) in that most missions must be successfully completed before the next can begin and, correspondingly, all missions of a campaign must be completed before advancement to the next one can occur. Each mission can require a team of up to four commandos, chosen from an international field of 40 available, each with individual attributes, abilities and specialties. Hidden & Dangerous contains a total of 23 missions with changeable weather patterns (rain, snow and fog), varying objectives and real-time movement through diverse terrain and locations. The game requires 3dfx graphics acceleration and provides viewpoint options from either first- or third-person perspectives. The world of Hidden & Dangerous is not stagnant, as objects within the environment move and react causing active strategic and tactical planning. Up to four players can cooperate per team over a LAN or the Internet. The game comes with a wide-ranging arsenal of WWII equipment, weapons, vehicles and objects from communication devices to camouflage uniforms, explosives and sniper rifles.

Re-Volt,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""For years, Toy-Volt has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost... magic. With their latest product, it appears that they've used a little too much of that special something, because the radio-controlled cars just off the production line have gained minds of their own! Escaping from the shelves that held them prisoners, the RC (radio-controlled) cars have escaped into the real world, and they're heading your way! Brand-new models, old favorites, even some experimental prototypes--the entire product line of RC cars from the fine folks at Toy-Volt has come out to play. They're causing plenty of chaos as they test their newfound freedom. You'll be racing inside, outside, upside down, and backwards! These RC cars are fast and spunky, each with different qualities and looks. As you progress, you'll unlock more and more cars to race and more and more courses to race on. Of course, sometimes the Toy-Volt cars don't play nice, making for lots of lightning-fast laps where you've got to fight oil with oil and ball bearings with ball bearings. You'll be racing around the neighborhood, around the supermarket, to places you only dreamed of racing an RC--like on the track you dream up using the Track Editor, or maybe on the pitching decks of a huge ship, or maybe you'll be good enough to unlock a Reverse Mirrored Track! But why waste time talking about all the fun when you can start having it?"", ""Imagine that all the coolest and most popular radio-controlled cars have come to life and escaped the store shelves. OK, maybe you'd better not. It's a silly idea that feels unnecessary and tacked on in Acclaim's new racing game Re-Volt. Fortunately, the game is better than its premise and delivers some memorable arcade racing thrills. On the other hand, Re-Volt has its share of problems and ends up being only decent when it could have been great. <P> Strip away the bad premise, and the basic idea behind the game is that you race little radio-controlled cars around a series of cool and unusual tracks. Essentially, you get to drive these puppies where you wouldn't be able to in real life. You have more than 28 different cars to choose from (each rated differently for speed, acceleration, and weight), though most of these are locked at the beginning of the game. As you progress through the game's four championship circuits, you'll gain access to more cars. <P> Tracks include the inside of a toy store, a suburban neighborhood, the deck of a ship, a museum, and a town in the Old West. In all, the game offers 14 single-player tracks including the stunt track, which is a free-for-all course on which you can try some slick jumps, loops, and other nifty maneuvers. If you manage to win enough races, you can also take on most of the tracks in mirrored or reverse modes. The game relies a little too heavily on this, however, and actually throws a mirrored track at you very early on. So instead of letting you race on a new track for each of your first 13 runs, you begin seeing familiar surroundings as early as your sixth race. <P> Fortunately, gameplay is pretty solid as far as arcade racers go. The game offers four different speed and realism settings, which govern how fast you can go and how harsh the physics are during each race. On the higher settings, Re-Volt can be extremely challenging, as it becomes remarkably easy to spin out your little car or, worse yet, flip it over to lose precious seconds. The lowest setting offers little relief, since it slaps a speed delimiter on your car but doesn't seem to slow down your opponents at all once you progress past the first championship circuit. Actually, that seems to be a theme throughout the game, since even when you're running flat-out with the fastest car available, the computer cars always seem to be able to pass you with ease. The AI also has access to different cars than you do at most points, which doesn't seem very fair. <P> Still, if you can grasp the controls, you should be able to stay competitive in Re-Volt after a few races' worth of practice. If you're still having trouble, the various power-ups can help even the odds a bit. The optional combat race mode lets you pick up much-needed energy boosts, as well as weapons and other goodies that you can use to take out your opponents. Of course, the AI cars can pick them up as well, so many races end up resembling high-speed mini-deathmatches. <P> As you compete, you'll find that one extremely annoying problem with Re-Volt is the lack of a basic save game feature. True, your progress is recorded after you complete a championship circuit, and each circuit is typically only three or four races in length. But the developers should have recognized the fact that not all players can sit down and race through four tracks at a time every time they play the game. Saving mid-race would be ludicrous, but saving after each race should have been a no-brainer. <P> Re-Volt includes a track editor that lets you build your own courses. While I'm hesitant to criticize any feature that lets you extend the life and enjoyment of a game, unfortunately the editor is rather unintuitive and offers a paltry array of scenery and track-style options. In fact, it's nearly impossible to recreate any of the pre-built tracks' coolest jumps, twists, or slopes with this editor. Also, you can't drop your track into any of the stunning environments that surround the game's pre-built tracks. A few more options, a much better interface, and a way to create surrounding terrain would not only have improved the editor, but would have made it fit the look, feel, and style of the game. As it stands, the game and the editor feel like they're two different products, not two parts of the same thing. <P> Don't get me wrong, Re-Volt isn't a bad game. It's quite a lot of fun, in fact. It even has a great soundtrack, which is predominantly techno-dance music but very good techno-dance music and perfect for the gameplay. But the overall package is weaker than it should be as a result of its scattered flaws, which is unfortunate since it could just as soon have been one of the year's best arcade racers.<i>--Michael E.

This year, EA Sports is going to mix it up a bit, eschewing most of the realism that has been a mainstay in EA's PGA games over the last nine years in favor of some more arcade-style elements. <P>The gameplay is described by EA as being more action-oriented than your average golf game.

Outcast - PC,,"['2 Disk', 'Classic Game']","['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>', '2 Disk', 'Classic Game']",{},"[""As a part of a covert experiment, the U.S. military deploys a probe designed to prove the existence of a parallel universe hidden from our own. Though the probe successfully reaches the planet Adelpha in the alternate universe, its first crucial data transmission is mysteriously cut short. The probe's unexpected demise triggers a disastrous chain of events, resulting in a black hole that threatens to engulf the earth. Unless the missing probe can somehow be found and repaired, the earth itself is doomed."", 'Outcast is an action-adventure from Infogrames that doesn\'t seem particularly original. Like many games that lay claim to that hybrid categorization, it presents you with a series of standard puzzles intermingled with some straightforward combat. But just as it seems to owe a big debt to the Tomb Raider series and other games in that vein, Outcast also comes across as unique. Perhaps it\'s that the story helps make even its silliest puzzle seem relevant or that the game comprises an enormous world populated with interesting characters. Whatever the case, although Outcast may not do anything new, it does what it does extremely well. <P> You play as stereotypical wisecracking action hero Cutter Slade, who has been commanded to lead a group of scientists on a rescue mission to a parallel world. Slade\'s mission goes awry, and he ends up alone and practically defenseless. The natives offer to help him, but only if he agrees to save their world from the tyranny of Fae Rhan. Apparently the natives think Slade is the savior prophesied by their previous leader. <P> The story actually gets more interesting than that, which is good considering that ""native people think average guy is a God"" seems like some \'50s B-movie cliche. To accomplish his task, Slade must collect five sacred objects from the various regions of the world. It\'s no easy task: The world is huge, as is Fae Rhan\'s army that guards every important area. To succeed, Slade has to gain the trust of the Talan natives, solve any number of their problems, and find ways to weaken Fae Rhan\'s army. <P> There\'s a great deal of exploration to be done. Luckily, it\'s an enjoyable endeavor. The six regions of Adelpha are all diverse, and better yet, the inhabitants are quite an interesting group. The majority have distinct personalities, which is impressive considering the huge number of Talan you\'ll encounter during your journeys. Nevertheless, it\'s hard to acclimate yourself to the environment at first: From the moment you awake on Adelpha, you\'ll be hit with a barrage of alien terminology, and trying to keep up can be intimidating. Fortunately, the game keeps extensive notes for you, which are helpful when you can\'t remember whether it\'s Zele or Zade that has the Booyat for Oru. <P> Your travels would be slightly more enjoyable were the terrain a bit better looking. Outcast uses a voxel-based engine, and voxel apologists will often cite that technology\'s strength as the ability to render at a greater distance than a polygon-based engine. Although this strength is occasionally expressed in Outcast\'s expansive environments, you\'ll also find that there are plenty of times when mountains and large buildings will pop up out of nowhere. There is one noticeable advantage to the engine, though: It allows for huge areas and their accompanying populations to be loaded very quickly. And any minor annoyances that arise from the game\'s graphic quality will be assuaged by Outcast\'s distinctive visual design. <P> Outcast sounds better than it looks. Every character speaks, most of the voice acting is good, and some of the voice acting is great. The voice of Slade himself is especially notable, even if much of his dialogue is silly. The game\'s dynamic soundtrack is excellent, and the triumphant battle music adds a great deal of tension to hostile situations. <P> And there are many such situations. While Outcast is an almost even split of action and adventure, it\'s the action portions that distinguish the game. You control Slade with the arrow keys, and you control the camera view with the mouse (you can play from a first- or third-person view). This atypical control scheme takes some getting used to, but it works well in firefights, letting you move freely without losing sight of your targets. Fights are made more fun by the fact that the artificial intelligence of your opponents is quite good. They\'ll run for cover, and they\'ll try to sneak up behind you. Sometimes it\'s easy to see the AI routines at work, and occasionally the enemies will just stand there while you take potshots, but your foes behave realistically overall, demanding a cautious approach to combat. <P> While the action sequences may be special, the adventure game elements aren\'t. The puzzles are pretty typical, involving pattern recognition, carting objects around to various characters, and so on. Luckily, the developers did such a great job creating the world that even the most mundane puzzles seem to make some sense in the larger scheme of things, and acting as the Talan\'s errand boy feels plausible. The nonlinear nature of the game is excellent - you can pretty much go anywhere at any point, provided you can get past the guards - and there are plenty of optional subquests you may not even encounter unless you talk to everyone several times. <P> Then again, at times this effort to create a whole new world is a bit much. The designers attempt to explain everything, from your unlimited carrying capacity (your backpack employs nanotechnology) to the ability to save your game (you are given a sacred crystal, called the ""gaamsaav,"" that ""imprints your state""). The latter example is particularly bad, as ""readying"" the gaamsaav takes a few moments, during which you can be surrounded or shot. It\'s easy enough to stop the process, but it would be nice to just save from a menu in tough situations, especially because you restore the game in the traditional sense anyway. <P> Outcast\'s problems don\'t end there. Characters will occasionally enter an endless animation loop while you\'re speaking to them, forcing you to restart from an earlier point. And saving is such an ordeal that you\'ll more than likely find your saved games few and far between. In combat, the third-person camera often zooms in and out drastically and without warning, which can be extremely disorienting. And one of the game\'s greatest strengths, its nonlinearity, can also be problematic, if not because you\'ll find it extremely difficult to track down your missing equipment, then because you can sometimes trigger linear plot points out of chronological order. <P> But while it can be frustrating at times, Outcast is mostly just fun. It belongs to that older breed of action-adventure hybrids; while it plays more like Tomb Raider, its spirit is more in line with Adeline\'s Twinsen games. Ultimately it presents you with a huge world to explore and an interesting history to learn, and doing so is an incredibly enjoyable experience.<i>--Ron Dulin</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

But because it arrives well after the original fantasy golf train had pulled in, concessions really can't be made for ingenuity, and the game must stand on gameplay, graphics, sound, and value alone.  It stands. But it certainly doesn't do much walking.  There are several play modes found within two main areas: single games and a career mode. The single mode offers more options, including stroke matches, skins, foursomes, tournament, four ball, shoot-out, range, and practice. The career mode lets you work your way up from the junior tour to the amateurs to the pros with one character at a time. (There are seven characters total, with six of them playable in their kid, teenager, and adult incarnations). The play modes don't really introduce many new concepts to the golf-game arena. The stroke match is exactly that, the tournament mode is exactly that, the skins... and so on. What the game delivers is the concept of power-ups (and not just extending your stroke) and driving-range target practice - both of which are interconnected.  In career mode, you can work your way through a 360-degree driving range (which is actually functional in only about 180 degrees), where you line up shots to hit the targets placed around the course. If you hit them, you'll earn power-ups such as a gumball, which prevents your ball from bouncing or rolling once it hits the ground; a power ball, which travels twice as far as the regular ball: an eyeball, which travels in a perfectly straight line; a superball, which, as the name implies, has an extraordinary bounce; and a few others. These items add to the gameplay in the same way the power-ups in Crave's Milo's Astro Lanes on the N64 added to that title's gameplay - they didn't save the game, but they made a somewhat dull or average experience a little better. The CyberTiger graphics have clearly attempted to ape the Mario Golf/Hot Shots Golf style, with less originality, and, frankly, less of the beauty. The interface is interesting - it includes all the basic features you need in a video golf game - whether it be a golf sim or a fantasy golf game. You have a swing meter, a distance indicator, terrain-height indicators, club choice, and so forth. Yet what seems to have happened in CyberTiger is that in arranging and rearranging these features on the screen to give the game an identity apart from the other games out there, the intuitive interface has been lost. Of course, if you play a lot of golf games, you'll figure it out pretty quickly, but the novice may find himself abuzz in all the numbers and meters that seem poorly placed, as compared to those in other fantasy golf titles. And novices are, after all, whom these games are trying to appeal to, right? The audio is another CyberTiger breakdown. It's neither catchy nor interesting, but rather bland and nondescript. The sounds are cut off prematurely and are mostly inaudible, if you care to hear what's being said in the first place. And if Mario Golf could handle audio on the N64.... CyberTiger does show in its controls. The stroke meter is responsive, and the ability to control the ball's spin in midair is a nice benefit. The multiplayer adds to what is essentially a pretty prosaic experience, although it's not enough to pull the overall score higher.  Perhaps EA can drag some more excitement into the game for the N64 version of the game, which is expected later this year. There's just something to be said for atmosphere in golf games. If you're playing a sim, well, you expect it to feel like a real golf course. If you're playing fantasy golf, it should feel more playful... less traditional. CyberTiger seems to be lost somewhere in between, not sure of what it wants to be. It's not Tiger Woods '99, and it's certainly not Hot Shots, so if you fall somewhere in between the two, you might like the game. Otherwise, hold out for Hot Shots Golf 2 or Tiger Woods 2000.<i>--Lauren Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

NBA Live 2000,,"['nintendo 64', 'game', 'nba live']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['<I>NBA Live 2000</I> rolls in the sixth generation of this very popular basketball series with a full license for the entire roster of NBA teams and players, tons of realism, updated graphics, and smarter artificial intelligence (AI). The N64 version offers two modes: arcade and simulation.  In arcade mode, players pull off monster dunks and over-the-top moves that put that ""Air"" guy to shame. Simulation mode brings the game back to earth with tournaments featuring actual rules and regulations, tighter AI, and the game\'s signature nonstop fast action. Players can go 5-on-5 on the regulation court or 1-on-1 on a street court in the day or night.', ""TNT's Reggie Theus adds commentary and Don Poier, voice of the Vancouver Grizzlies, takes care of play-by-play reporting. Television-style camera shots pick the best view of the action with perfect camera angles, zooms, replays, and cutscenes. A create-a-player feature lets players build a player from scratch, adjusting his features, facial expressions, and playing abilities."", 'As expected, the graphics are very detailed, down to the accurate renderings of the faces of present-day and retired NBA players, including His Airness, Michael Jordan. Real-time lighting effects add realism, and true-to-life player reactions to free throws, high fives, congratulatory knuckle-touches, fouls, and injuries bring the spirit of the court into the game. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>', ""Like clockwork, EA Sports has brought the magic of the NBA Live series to the N64 for another year. Like any good sports series, a slew of new touches has been added, the most notable of which is the inclusion of Michael Jordan in the game's lineup. Yes, along with all the actual players, teams, and arenas of the NBA, the game also includes all-star teams from the last five decades, letting you play as some of the greatest players ever to set foot on the court. While the game includes several modes of play, such as an arcade mode with exaggerated dunks and flaming basketballs, a three-point shootout, and a one-on-one street-ball mode, the game's main focus is still happily on season mode and actual NBA basketball with actual NBA rules. NBA Live 2000's easy-to-use control scheme lets you jump right in and start taking the ball to the hoop. Once you've got the basics down, you can start experimenting with the game's more-advanced control scheme, which not only lets you pull off more maneuvers on the court, but also lets you set up offensive and defensive formations. The computer AI ranges from easy to hard (unless you're playing the one-on-one mode against Jordan, who always seems difficult to beat), depending on what difficulty setting you have the game set on. The computer teams set up plays and run them at the appropriate time. For instance, you'll see the computer kill the clock in the closing seconds of a game ifit has the advantage, forcing you to put on a little full-court press.  Visually, the game looks quite nice. The players are good representations of their real-life counterparts. Their animation and moves are smooth and look quite natural. The game features multiple camera angles and zoom settings, allowing you to see the action from just about anywhere you like. The game also features an instant replay that shows dramatic points in a game, like big dunks. The replays, however, are pretty weak - the frame rate drops so low that it looks more like a slide show.  In the audio department, NBA Live 2000 does a decent job of re-creating the sounds of the NBA experience. The game's sneaker squeaks, dribbling, and various other sound effects are passable. The play-by-play calls are way too infrequent. One nice audio touch happens when you use created players. If you enter a last name for your created player, and that name is the same as that of one of the players from the NBA, such as Anderson or Miller, the game will recognize it, and the announcer will call out the name during play. In the end, NBA Live 2000 is a good basketball game for the N64. It doesn't really offer anything special in graphics, control, or any other category. But it does do the NBA Live series justice, and it is the best N64 iteration of the series yet. The extras - like the arcade mode, one-on-one, and three-point contest - are nice and add to the game's value. Fans of previous versions of Live N64 will have a good time.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

It's loud, fast--and memorable--stomach-churning fun."", ""Supercross 2000 is Electronic Arts' entry into the world of dirt bike racing, and it definitely feels like a first-year effort. Control issues and dodgy graphics plant Supercross 2000 firmly behind 989 Sports' recent addition to the genre, Supercross Circuit. Supercross 2000 is broken up into two styles. The racing mode puts you on lots of different tracks, while the freestyle mode puts you in a large area populated with jumps, bowls, and other air-enablers. On paper, both modes look really cool, but the game's control really isn't up to snuff, and this takes a lot away from what otherwise would have been a pretty good game. The problems surface when you make turns. The game tries to make turning realistic, in that your rider will put his foot down if you jam the stick all the way to one side, but you never seem to turn with a tight enough radius to feel fully in control of your bike. Turning problems aside, the game features a pretty nice physics model, and the bikes buckle and bounce in a realistic fashion after big jumps. Graphically, the game looks a little boxy, especially the racers' legs and torsos, but everything runs at a tolerable frame rate in both one- and two-player mode. The game's sound is every bit as annoying as real supercross races, complete with grinding, buzzing motors. The play-by-play is low on the personality meter, sticking strictly to calling out passes, tricks, and other semi-important events. If you're a fan of supercross, 989's Supercross Circuit is the game to get. EA's Supercross series may eventually become a contender, but this first effort is lacking. Hopefully we'll see some control tweaks and some improved performance in the sound and graphics departments in the unannounced-but-you-know-EA-will-eventually-do-it sequel.  <I>--Jeff Gerstmann </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

But unlike other wrestling games, fighting in the ring is just  a formality. <i>WCW Mayhem</i> wrestlers are free to take the action ringside or  backstage, where a variety of tools of the trade--folding chairs, tables, and other  smashable objects--are within reach.', 'In career mode, players slam their way toward the championship. Other game options  include single match, tag team, triangle, four-way dance, and battle royal.', 'The companies in the business of making wrestling games recently played a high-stakes game of musical chairs. Longtime WCW collaborator THQ managed to get hold of the WWF license, leaving Acclaim to sit around and talk about its secret plans for a new wrestling game. Electronic Arts stepped in and grabbed the WCW license. The company is taking the same approach here as it has taken with most of its sports titles. The development team aimed to be as faithful to the source material as it could. The resulting game, WCW Mayhem, is a very good first effort, but it still feels like a first-year title.', ""Mayhem contains loads of different rings, all based on WCW television and pay-per-view events, ranging from your basic Monday Nitro set all the way up to Souled Out and Bash at the Beach. EA has provided an entire slew of WCW wrestlers to fight in these rings. Most of the popular wrestlers are featured, including Kevin Nash, Sting, and Goldberg. The game also features a slew of midcard wrestlers, like La Parka, Rey Mysterio Jr., and Disco Inferno. As in most other wrestling games, the roster isn't entirely accurate (Chris Jericho and Raven are still in the game, Hogan appears in his old NWO gear, etc.) but this doesn't really get in the way of the game at all."", ""The main focus of the game is the ability it gives you to get out of the ring and fight your way to the backstage area, which is filled with chairs, tables, tasers, and other objects that you can use to bash your opponent's skull in. As a result, the game defaults to no-count out, pin-anywhere matches."", 'WCW Mayhem\'s gameplay is much more arcade-like than most of the wrestling games that came before it. There\'s still plenty of strategy involved, but it\'s more of the ""step out of the way of that drop kick"" variety than of the ""what move should I do next"" type. Reversals are easy to perform, but very tough to master. If your opponent hits a button to execute a move, and you hit the same button shortly after, you\'ll reverse his attack. But reversals aside, the game really boils down to who can do a move first. There aren\'t any fancy fighting-game moves here, either. Each of the four main buttons is capable of three moves, depending on which direction you\'re pressing on the controller at the time.', ""The arcade-style gameplay is a nice change of pace from the other games on the market, but it's not without its flaws. Rather than focus too greatly on health, the game relies on a momentum meter that tells you how well you're doing at any point in the match. The meter moves back and forth, and it will move toward your side when you execute impressive moves or find the time to taunt. If all the wrestlers in the match are fairly inactive, the meter will center. The more momentum you get, the harder it will be for your opponent to stop you. When your momentum meter is full, you can perform your finishing move. This allows for some good back-and-forth swings, but in actual use, it really just makes coming back from a deficit much tougher. Once you and your friends have all gotten good at dodging attacks, though, it becomes very hard to pull off a string of moves, and the result is a stalemate match that takes forever and ends on a lucky pin after a weak move."", ""The computer player doesn't fall prey to that problem, though, because it's got problems all its own: It's completely stupid. The computer will get off a few kicks and punches from time to time, and it may even reverse a move or two if you've got it set to the hardest difficulty setting. There's no one move you have to do - any move or hold will do. All you need to do is get off a few quick attacks at the beginning of the match. Then, after you've worn the enemy wrestler down a bit, just start grappling and pulling off moves at will. It's possible to hit a finisher within the first 30 seconds of the match, though you won't be able to complete a pin until much later. The difficulty setting has less to do with how aggressive the computer plays and more to do with how long it takes to damage the other wrestler enough to successfully pin him. The computer is also very shy about getting out of the ring. If the computer player doesn't think it's close enough to attack you once you're both outside the ring, it will simply climb back into the ring and taunt a few times. Since one of the main points of the game is getting out of the ring and wrestling in the backstage area, this is extremely annoying."", ""The create-a-wrestler feature is nice, but it doesn't really touch WWF Attitude in terms of depth and choice. The textures provided are a bit more realistic than some of Attitude's clothing, so most of the wrestlers you create will look as though they actually belong in a ring.

If you master the moves, you may just walk home with a shiny new belt!', 'The field of handheld wrestling games is rife with rehashed, utterly poor sequels. Oddly enough, Electronic Arts\' first foray into the Game Boy Color happens to be a wrestling game, WCW Mayhem. Thankfully, the game\'s pretty darn decent, and it\'s not just another rehash. As in other GBC wrestling titles, Mayhem\'s feature set is short and to the point. You can control one of 11 wrestlers in a ""quest for the best"" route to the title, take them on in one-on-one fashion, or play against a human opponent in versus mode. Options such as cage match or create-a-player are nowhere to be found. Once you\'ve chosen from the likes of Sting, Hollywood Hogan, Booker T, Bret Hart, and others, it\'s time to enter the ring for some mat-tastic wrestling action. A is punch, B is kick, and various combinations let you grapple and perform takedowns. The response is fast, special moves are easy to do, and the computer rarely makes you feel helpless. When battling in the ring gets boring, you can take things into the locker room or back alley as well. This adds entertainment to the game, especially since there\'s only one arena to battle in. As a single-player game, Mayhem gets old after a short time, limiting it to quick spurts of gaming. For a two-player game though, the game\'s frenetic button-mashing and constant reversals make for an adrenaline-packed experience. Visually speaking, Mayhem isn\'t a masterpiece, but it is executed well. There is only one arena, but it\'s nicely colored, it flows with spectators, and it gives off a decent feeling of 3D. It\'s silly that handheld wrestling games continue to lack a greater variety of arenas, but at least EA made an effort to break the monotony with the locker room and alleyway settings. Character sprites are drawn cartoonish, albeit in only four or five colors, with an animation level at least twice that of Acclaim\'s ECW Hardcore Revolution. Still, while the wrestlers look and move decently, there\'s just something a bit too cartoony about everything. Truthfully, WCW Mayhem\'s graphics represent the pinnacle of GBC wrestling games, which is a sad statement, in that there\'s much room for improvement. While Mayhem\'s gameplay, control, and visuals are worthy of above-average marks, the game\'s audio experience is enough to incite this rotund reviewer to fits of rage. Is there some rule that says handheld wrestling games can only have two music tracks? There must be, because WCW Mayhem continues the tradition. The background tracks are nice and upbeat, but who wants to listen to the same track for 11 matches, then a second one at the end? In regard to its effects, the game at least turns in a respectable showing. Punches and kicks land with the best ""thud"" noise the GBC speaker can produce, while a variety of crash and explosion sounds launch from the system whenever a special move is performed. There are also a few sampled sound snippets, the most notable being the crowd noise before the round starts and the ref\'s cry of ""1-2-3"" during a pin. While EA has at least tripled the number of effects over Acclaim\'s ECW Hardcore Revolution, more detail in the sound department would have been nice. WCW Mayhem marks a respectable entry for EA into the realm of handheld wrestling titles. While a great deal needs improvement, the company has easily turned out the best GBC wrasslin\' title to date. Furthermore, since the game has a more well-known license, featuring the likes of Hollywood Hogan and Goldberg, the excitement level is also a cut above the rest.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

FIFA Major League Soccer 2000,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['FIFA Major League Soccer 2000', ""Even with the recent excitement generated by the US team's dominance in the Women's World Cup, soccer still isn't that large of a phenomenon in the States. American soccer fans may not be able to get Monday Night Soccer anytime soon, but they can at least get EA Sport's FIFA series - easily the best line of soccer games to hit both consoles and the PC. The latest of EA's soccer simulators, FIFA 2000, proves that the highly acclaimed FIFA line is still the best soccer series out there. <P>There's more significance in the name FIFA 2000 than just the year. FIFA 2000 is truly the soccer game of a new millenium, and it has huge improvements over FIFA 99. The most obvious improvement is the addition of the 12 MLS teams to the already large roster of countless other leagues. Now fans of American soccer can pit their favorite US teams against each other, or even against the superior world teams. FIFA 2000 also introduces a few important gameplay additions that provide so much added depth to the game you'll wonder how you ever got through FIFA 99 without them. Mirroring popular football and baseball games on the market today, FIFA 2000 introduces icon passing from penalty locations. This makes it much easier to assist would-be strikers from the corners - with a button press you can guide a corner kick directly to your man inside the box, who is waiting to head the ball home. Another feature you'll learn to love is the pass-reliability rating - a small colored arrow in the pass direction that changes color depending on how well defended the pass recipient is. On defense, you can control your team's aggressiveness and formation on the fly, even so far as to make all your defenders leave their man and run at the ball at the touch of a button. With another touch of the button, they'll quickly return to the default strategy. All these additions are both well implemented and simple to use, enhancing the gameplay instead of overly complicating it. <P>The basic modes you expect from the FIFA series are still intact. There's an exhibition, tournament, season, and practice mode. There's also the create-a-player mode, and you can even customize the teams to your preferences. You get to choose from tons of options, including three skill levels. You decide on the weather, the arenas, the camera angle, and more. There's a pretty big jump between skill levels; indeed, the amateur level - which the game defaults to - is a little too easy for regular FIFA players, while the professional level - the next in line - is almost a slap in the face to those used to scoring eight or nine goals a game. All of this resides behind a useful interface, that admittedly, takes some time to get used to. <P>The exhibition mode is simple enough - pick your teams, your stadium, the weather, and other options, and then go for it. The season mode is a little more complex. Once you pick your team, you can trade players, create custom players, play around with your formations, and substitute your line around, all the while playing against different teams as you progress on your way to the World Cup. The tournament mode lets you set up a single elimination tournament. You can create your own cup as the prize for the tournament mode or use one of the default cups. The practice mode lets you select different practice scenarios to hone the weak points in your game. <P>The graphics are probably the most notable difference from last year's game. FIFA 2000 has gotten a stunning graphical facelift, and it looks absolutely fabulous. All the player animation has been motion captured, meaning that everything the characters do - from sprinting to tackling to bicycle kicks - looks amazingly realistic. That, combined with much better textures, accurate facial models, and variously sized players make this the best-looking soccer game on the PlayStation. I haven't noticed any polygonal breakup or overlap - the graphics look that nice. <P>The FIFA series has always been known for its cool soundtrack, from FIFA 99's Fatboy Slim-composed theme song Rockafeller Skank to FIFA 98's Song 2, performed by Blur. This year the game has got more big names like Robbie Williams, who performed an entirely original song for the soundtrack, to other favorites like Reel Big Fish, and Apollo Four Forty, whose music pumps over the game's menu screens. In the game, however, the audio department is handed off to ESPN commentator Phil Schoen and Women's World Cup star Julie Foudy, who help call the action. While Schoen and Foudy are both competent, neither is as exciting as the English superstar soccer commentator and long-running FIFA veteran John Motson, who is nowhere to be found in FIFA 2000, even though he's mentioned in the credits. Foudy is especially irritating, with a sugary, almost prepubescent voice that doesn't complement her cracks about player injuries and difficult saves. Otherwise, the sound effects are simply incredible, with an extremely realistic crowd-reaction system that accurately represents how fans would audibly react to the current situation. <P>It's almost as if FIFA 2000 were EA Sport's attempt to Americanize soccer. Banking on the success of the US Women's World Cup Team by including Foudy, replacing favorite Motson with American commentator Schoen, and introducing the MLS teams, FIFA 2000 is the most US-friendly version of FIFA to hit shelves. This gives FIFA 2000 an entirely different feel than previous versions of the series, but it still delivers everything you've come to expect from FIFA. FIFA 2000 is more than just better than last year's game, it is easily the best soccer game ever to grace the PlayStation. --Ben Stahl <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Reach for the Stars - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<I>Reach for the Stars</I> is a turn-based strategy game of epic galactic exploration, colonization, and conquest. The original RFTS released in the mid-1980s was wildly popular in its day, and maintains a loyal following. <I>Reach for the Stars</I> is considered to be one of the original 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) games.', ""Reach for the Stars was originally released by SSG back in 1983, when asterisks and ampersands were used to make graphics in computer games. Having created the game, codesigners Roger Keating and Ian Trout effectively launched the genre of 4-X space games - explore, expand, exploit, exterminate. Seventeen years later, the statute of limitations on game titles must have expired because even though it's technically a sequel, SSG's latest release is still just called Reach for the Stars. While the recycled title suggests that SSG is trying to recapture the essence of its classic game, the modern version of Reach for the Stars suffers from the problem common to remakes: Instead of letting you relive the original, it just makes you miss playing the original. Reach for the Stars is a conventional empire-building game set in space. Your task is to research new technologies, build advanced ships, explore neighboring star systems, and eventually conquer the galaxy as you expand your forces from your home planet. Along the way you'll encounter alien races, fight massive space battles, and invade enemy-held territory. In theory, it should be an engrossing game. Unfortunately, Reach for the Stars incorporates several design decisions that prevent it from achieving the standards set by its old predecessor or by other space-empire games that were built on the original Reach for the Stars' groundbreaking ideas."", 'Reach for the Stars plays out over a square map grid containing various star systems. Each system can have multiple planets, and these planets vary in levels of habitability for each race in the game. Once a planet has been colonized, you can develop it by building industrial, defense, research, shipyard, and training facilities. There are only six different building types total, and these can be upgraded from one level to another. Planets produce one new building per turn, assuming they have enough resource points to do so.', 'There are 16 different races in Reach for the Stars, although this total includes several types of humans. Each has a separate tech tree to research and different tolerances for various environmental conditions (like a methane atmosphere or high gravity), as well as different growth rates and trade benefits. Each race also has a different base rate of fire for space combat, which determines the number of times ships can fire in a given amount of time. This number ultimately seems to be more important than the other factors, as races with a high rate of fire seem to have a distinct advantage throughout the game whenever combat invariably ensues. Other factors that should balance out the rate of fire apparently do not.', 'The designers of Reach for the Stars state on the game\'s home page that they have ""gone to a lot of trouble to ensure that giving orders in the game is as easy as possible."" This is somewhat surprising, because the interface is possibly the game\'s weakest point - at least initially. At the outset, you\'re presented with a bewildering set of different buttons and displays, none of which make the slightest intuitive sense. There are tooltips on how to label each button, but these do little to explain what the buttons actually do. Because of this, Reach for the Stars is almost impossible to figure out by just jumping into the game. Even the tutorial doesn\'t adequately explain what\'s going on.', ""For this reason, learning to play Reach for the Stars requires a thorough reading of the manual. This is a problem largely because the manual has no index and is badly organized. Even experienced strategy-game players will find the manual a necessity, and it is written so that the only way to figure out the game is to read the manual from cover to cover, since the layout is not conducive to skimming. Novice players unprepared for this will quickly become frustrated at the inability to just start playing the game. This will undoubtedly prevent many people from getting to the point where the interface shows its benefits, but once you've become used to the interface, things do become easier."", ""Space combat in Reach for the Stars is rather abstracted. You have no direct control over the individual ships in your fleets. Each side chooses a formation and a range, and the range at which the engagement takes place is a function of the two choices as well as the difference in engine quality between the two sides. There are four formation options, and each has advantages and disadvantages based on the fleet's predominant weapons and the enemy's formation. Once engaged in combat, you can only attempt to change the range between rounds, or withdraw. The computer handles all weapon targeting. The simplicity of space combat carries over to the ship designs. These designs have none of the complexity or richness of space-exploration games like Master of Orion, as there are only six different kinds of ship systems, and the design mostly involves nothing more than loading a hull with as many beam or missile weapons as it can hold."", ""While this apparent decision to shift emphasis away from micromanagement is certainly understandable, it leads to a number of problems. The biggest one is simply that once you abstract everything, there isn't anything left to draw you into the game and make it interesting. In the Master of Orion series, the competition to develop new technologies to outfit a new class of starships was at the heart of the game. This was enhanced by the need to build complementary ship types that could aid one another in combat. Given this focus, the rest of the game fell into place without the need for excessive detail elsewhere. Reach for the Stars gets rid of all this but doesn't replace it with anything. For example, there is no technology trading or espionage, which leaves you wondering what you have left."", ""Viewed purely as a strategy game, Reach for the Stars does offer a number of challenges. As can be expected from a game programmed by Keating/Trout, the computer opponent is very competitive. Furthermore, because there are only a limited number of things to do in the game, the number of decisions stays very manageable, and the flow of the game is smooth even when a lot of fleets are under your command. Planetary development, ship building, and fleet movement are all simple enough that you rarely feel overwhelmed, and even with all these to account for, SSG definitely achieved its goal of promoting overall strategy over micromanagement. The only problem is that without any micromanagement, Reach for the Stars does tend to become awfully sterile. However, you'll sometimes experience moments of frustration instead, especially when you find that enemy fleets in hyperspace can't been seen - once a fleet leaves a system, you just have to wait for it to reappear somewhere else. In large scenarios, keeping track of the enemy is a significant task. If this is the sort of challenge you like, you'll probably enjoy Reach for the Stars."", ""Reach for the Stars also has good stand-alone scenarios. While it's superficially not all that different from a random campaign, the game's two-dozen scenarios offer preconfigured, balanced starting situations with a variety of map sizes, objectives, and game lengths. One such scenario depicts the well-worn space-opera theme of a crumbling empire being overthrown by several internal and external enemies, each competing with the others as well as with the imperial menace. There's also a powerful game editor included that even lets you create your own new species and tech trees."", ""Ultimately, Reach for the Stars seems like a strategy game that's only incidentally set in space. It's a challenging game, but the details that would normally draw you into the environment are virtually absent. In addition, the game has serious balance problems that make particular races much more viable than others. Nevertheless, Reach for the Stars may please players who are looking for an epic strategy game that's light on micromanagement, but science-fiction and empire-building fans will be hard-pressed to find something in the game to get excited about.<i>--Bruce Geryk</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc.

Army Men (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""When 3DO stopped billing Army Men as a strategy game and began labeling it an action game, many gamers were frustrated that they wouldn't be able to relive their plastic childhood battles in a real-time strategy setting. But the final result is a compelling game, and its only major fault is that it doesn't play up the toy soldier bit as much as it should."", 'In Army Men, you are cast in the role of Sarge, an onscreen hero who is responsible for fulfilling a variety of mission objectives set down by Green Army headquarters. You move your character around huge maps, picking up, using, and discarding different types of weapons; scooping up medkits, air support markers, and other items; hopping into and out of vehicles; and coaxing any accompanying troops into battle. At varying intervals along the way, enemy troops, combat vehicles, and various types of fortifications are dispersed across the map, deployed to stop Sarge from accomplishing his mission. When battle is joined, Sarge can fire his weaponry from either a standing, kneeling, or prone position and can evade enemy fire by diving or rolling to either side. Since Sarge can carry only three types of weapons and gear at a time, the trick is knowing when to drop certain articles in favor of more suitable items.', 'Interestingly, there are no independent scenarios included in the game. Instead, Army Men features a grand campaign game, which is segmented into three sequentially playable mini-campaigns. You begin the game in a desertlike region, eventually move on to an alpine setting, then finish your tour of duty in bayou country. Each mini-campaign is further subdivided into four scenarios, which, in turn, are composed of two to three interrelated missions played out across huge battle maps. In the process, you are slowly brought up to speed regarding the progress of the war with the evil Tan Army, which at times may be further augmented by units from the supposedly neutral Blue and Grey Armies.', 'Army Men also comes equipped with an informal boot camp, whereby you receive rudimentary training on the game interface, on how to use each type of weapon, and on how to issue orders to different combat units. You meander through a stylized shooting range, learning how to control your character, identify weapons caches, shoot rifles and bazookas, toss grenades, fire mortars, and handle flamethrowers. You are also taught how to lay mines, detect and unearth enemy minefields, plant explosives, call in air strikes and photo reconnaissance missions, drop paratroopers, and lead squads of loyal plastic soldiers into battle. In addition, you learn how to operate several different types of WWII-era combat vehicles, spanning everything from a jeep and a 2 1/2-ton truck to a half-track and a tank. Apart from the truck, each vehicle is outfitted with a rotating turret, which can train and fire its weapon across a 360-degree arc regardless of which direction the vehicle is moving.', ""Missions run the gamut, from simple reconnaissance operations to full-blown search-and-destroy operations involving multiple squads, several combat vehicles, and even air support. The typical mission brief usually entails moving Sarge from one map sector to another, sometimes requiring him to conduct special tasks along the way. Fortunately, it's always up to you to determine Sarge's route, what types of weapons he'll carry, discard, or use, when and where he'll confront the enemy, how he'll disperse any accompanying units, and how he'll employ any and all supporting arms. More importantly, gameplay is far from linear. Objectives can usually be reached using multiple avenues of approach, a variety of weaponry, and a wide array of battle tactics. For instance, instead of going toe-to-toe with an enemy tank and perhaps risking Sarge in an all-or-nothing engagement, you can try to lure the onrushing tank into a hastily sewn minefield. Alternatively, Sarge could be ordered to blow up a crucial bridge thereby preventing the tank from interfering with the mission at hand. Similarly, Sarge could order in air support, hop in another combat vehicle, or send in troops to destroy the tank while he watches from a safe vantage point. As a result, you are not bound by any predetermined set of rules and instead may fulfill the mission objectives any way you deem necessary."", ""Army Men's combat animations are first-rate. Destroyed combat vehicles are flipped over or smashed into little pieces, a broken axle flimsily lying alongside the smoldering wreck as if to say these are still nothing more than glorified war toys. Explosions too are well handled with vibrant spouts of flame and choking debris showering the battlefield. The sound effects are equally superb, typically depicting men screaming in agony as they're continually burned, bombed, run over, or blown to smithereens. About the only thing missing is the flat stand-up bases, which have come to epitomize the weak-kneed plastic soldiers."", ""Despite its charm, Army Men nevertheless manages to shoot itself in the foot on several counts. For starters, you are unable to save a mission in progress and must either complete the mission or repeat it from the very beginning. Now, considering the time and effort it takes to move your forces from one end of the map to the other and the number of pitched battles you must fight along the way, I can't for the life of me understand why a save-game option wasn't made available. Secondly, combat vehicles can easily be put out of action long before they engage the enemy, oftentimes becoming immobilized if they inadvertently ram a tree or get hung up on a few rocks. Even if they're meant to portray plastic combat vehicles, the system could have been better tweaked to allow for an occasional mishap. Lastly, Army Men's replay value is extremely limited. For all intents and purposes, once you've conquered the immense campaign game, your military career has come to a screeching halt. While the inclusion of a multiplayer option is indeed commendable, no provision was made to let you create your own scenarios much less swap them with your friends."", 'While the plastic soldier theme might have been better served if it had played up the Toy Story angle a bit more, the end result is fun nonetheless. Army Men successfully melds the old with the new, taking an ageless pastime and literally, as well as figuratively, giving it new hi-tech legs. -- <i>Marc Dultz</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Also, you can play as any of the four navies, which can make things interesting. <P>Twelve historical single-battle scenarios are also included with the game, along with a scenario editor. The editor is fairly simplistic and easy to use. With it you can create some impressive fantasy engagements, such as the Yamato vs. the Bismarck or a 1940s version of Jutland with two huge fleets pounding each other to dust. I was a little disappointed that the game only included ships commissioned through 1942, however, since that meant no Iowa-class battleships. Of course, the fact that the game only simulates surface combat means that there are also no carriers or submarines - two ship types that played just a minor role in deciding the outcome of the war. <P>For the most part, Fighting Steel does a good job of re-creating the WWII naval surface warfare. The game includes over 1,000 ships (from 90 classes), 50 different guns, and 13 different torpedo types. The range, effects, and effectiveness of each weapon type appear to be accurate. Each ship is also rated for crew quality, crew fatigue, and night-fighting abilities. <P>Each ship class has been modeled accurately and stunningly in 3D (especially the Yamato, which looks great). Just for the hell of it, you can even deck out your ships with custom paint schemes. Weather and time of day play a part in every battle, as the game will reduce visibility for night battles, heavy seas, and rain. Also, you can turn on smoke screens, fire star shells, and track targets with powerful search lights. In fact, the 3D engine is one of this game\'s strengths, just as it was the only positive point in Buccaneer, Divide By Zero\'s last effort. <P>Fighting Steel gets another nod for sound effects, which are fantastic. The rolling, thunderous roar of a battleship\'s heavy guns, the steely hiss of a torpedo hitting the water, and the groaning of twisted metal on a damaged ship all combine to create a highly immersive atmosphere. It\'s a little disappointing that all ships seem to have the same range of sound effects for their main guns, but the overall effect is still quite impressive. <P>Campaign gameplay is very similar to Avalon Hill\'s Wooden Ships & Iron Men, only on a larger scale (since that game only gave you command of a single ship). This is not necessarily a good thing. You select ships for your cruising force from a list of all ships available on a given date, then hit the ""next"" button to see if you\'re lucky enough to have a battle break out somewhere. Engagements seem entirely random in this game, as in Wooden Ships, and that makes the campaign feel tacked on and unrealistic. How about allowing me to assign different task forces to different cruising grounds? How about forcing the player to spread his forces thinly in an attempt to hunt down an enemy battleship? How about letting players react to a meeting engagement by sending in reinforcements from other locations? A grand strategic view of the campaign theater would make this a very different game, it\'s true, but the resulting game could be so much better. <P>A new interface would also help Fighting Steel tremendously. As it stands, you have to wade through countless buttons and menus in order to get anything done in this game. The pop-up ship-status windows are a great feature, but the rest of the interface is confusing and unintuitive. Issuing navigational commands can be a particularly difficult task, and the gunnery commands are even worse. Why, for instance, do my ships continuously lose targets and stop firing, even when other enemy vessels are in range and I have assigned my ships a fire mode (range, battle line, or threat targeting)? When they lose one target, they should have enough initiative to start pounding on another - it\'s that simple. Having to go through each and every ship\'s gunnery target menus is an extreme example of unwanted micromanagement. <P>Even with these flaws, however, Fighting Steel is a good game. It\'s fun, it seems to be fairly realistic in most regards, and it can be quite addictive. The 3D graphics are very good, and it is downright thrilling to see your heavy ships pound the enemy with their 15-inch guns. Getting your fast-moving destroyers in among a slow-moving enemy convoy is especially gratifying. The real problem with the game, then, is its stability - or complete lack thereof. <P>Simply put, Fighting Steel is crippled by crash bugs that lock the game and the PC at seemingly random moments in gameplay. Even with a beta patch from the developer (version 1.01), the game continuously locked up in battles of all sizes, at all times of day, and at various stages of the action. These crashes rendered the game nearly unplayable - the only saving grace being a save-game feature (which works at any point in a campaign or battle) and an auto-save feature. But these are slim compensation when the game locks up every single time you try to finish a battle. <P>A few more weeks in testing could certainly have helped Fighting Steel. As it is, SSI and Divide By Zero will have to work feverishly on a patch to correct the game\'s instability. To its credit, SSI has been quick to address the game\'s problems thus far. Hopefully, it will be able to clean the game up entirely in the very near future because there\'s a very good game behind the bugs. Until the problems are fixed, however, purchase and play Fighting Steel at your own risk.<I>--Michael E. Ryan </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

It's in the game. The greats are back. Jordan, Chamberlain, Bird, Cousy and Dr. J. Play on your custom Street Court."", ""Like clockwork, EA Sports has brought the magic of the NBA Live series to the PlayStation for another year. Like any good sports series, a slew of new touches has been added, the most notable of which is the inclusion of Michael Jordan in the game's lineup. Yes, along with all the actual players, teams, and arenas of the NBA, the game also includes all-star teams composed of players from the last five decades, letting you play as some of the greatest players ever to set foot on the court. While the game includes several modes of play, such as an arcade mode with exaggerated dunks and flaming basketballs, a three-point shootout, and a one-on-one street-ball mode, the game's main focus is still happily on season mode and actual NBA basketball with actual NBA rules. NBA Live 2000's easy-to-use control scheme lets you jump right in and start taking the ball to the hoop. Once you've got the basics down, you can start experimenting with the game's more-advanced control scheme, which not only lets you pull off more maneuvers on the court, but also lets you set up offensive and defensive formations. The computer AI ranges from easy to hard (unless you're playing the one-on-one mode against Jordan, who always seems difficult to beat), depending on what difficulty setting you have the game set on. The computer teams set up plays and run them at the appropriate time. For instance, you'll see the computer kill the clock in the closing seconds of a game if it has the advantage, forcing you to put on a little full-court press.  Visually, the game looks quite nice. The players are good representations of their real-life counterparts. Their animation and moves are smooth and look quite natural. The game features multiple camera angles and zoom settings, letting you see the action from just about anywhere you like. The game also features an instant replay that shows dramatic points in a game, like big dunks. During the replays you can catch a glimpse of the players up close and actually see the expressions on their faces change.  In the audio department, NBA Live 2000 does a decent job of re-creating the sounds of the NBA experience. The game's sneaker squeaks, dribbling, and various other sound effects are accurate. The play-by-play calls along with the roar of the crowd really draws you into the game. One nice audio touch happens when you use created players. If you enter a last name for your created player, and that name is the same as that of one of the players from the NBA, such as Anderson or Miller, the game will recognize it, and the announcer will call out the name during play. In the end, NBA Live 2000 is a good basketball game for the PlayStation. While it doesn't offer anything spectacular in graphics, control, or any one category, the game's overall feel and look is quite good. Fans of the NBA Live series will undoubtedly see it as the best iteration of the series yet for the PlayStation. The extras - like the arcade mode, one-on-one, and three-point contest - are nice and add to the game's value. Fans of previous versions of Live will have a good time.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Finish them off once and for all and battle the queen alien boss in this better-than-Duke <i>Atomic Edition</i>. It's complete with aliens, strippers, steroids, adult language, humor, and violence."", 'Sure, it\'s crude. Sure, it could be called sexist, and sure, a good part of it seems designed by socially backward fourteen-year-old boys. Still, once you get past a few distasteful points (such as Duke\'s steroid-induced buffness), Duke Nukem 3D offers a fast-paced respite from the DOOM-and-gloom tone of most first-person shooters on the market. It\'s hard to hold a grudge against someone who grumbles, ""It\'s time to kick ass and chew gum, and I\'m all out of gum.""', 'Is there a plot? Not really - there\'s just a premise, and one so thin that it might not even be pitchable to a Hollywood producer. Seems a bunch of aliens have descended on Earth to ""steal our chicks,"" as Duke so delicately puts it. It\'s up to you, as Duke, to save the day by, basically, shooting everything that moves and a few things that don\'t.', ""Anyone familiar with this genre of games will be instantly at home. In between killing aliens, you have to collect security cards (think keys from DOOM), which allow you access to various parts of a level. You finish a level by making it to the Self-Destruct button (how you can win by blowing yourself up is beyond us, but hey, Duke works in mysterious ways). There are some puzzle elements to each level, but none too tough for one who's made it through Marathon."", 'Speaking of Marathon: inevitably, comparisons will be made. Build, the graphics engine behind Duke Nukem 3D, is still a ""2 1/2-D"" construct - not truly 3D. However, it does allow more 3D-like effects than the Marathon engine, such as crouching, jumping, ramps, and multistory buildings. There\'s even a submarine you can board, and a subway car. Also, Duke\'s world is far more interactive than Marathon\'s. Phones have dial tones, vases shatter in a cross-fire, windows break, and when you come across a pool table you can roll the balls around.', ""Still, there are some areas in which the Marathon series retains an edge. Swimming and flying in Duke Nukem 3D is downright boring: You move up or down, and stay in one place without bobbing or sinking. There's also no mystery at all in Duke Nukem 3D. Shoot, watch the gore, run on. The ingenuity of some levels, and some honestly funny parts (besides the alien on the toilet, I mean) do entice you to play on, but there's little to go back to and try to understand. Then again, nobody's selling this game as a replacement for graduate studies. And, make no mistake, Duke is fun."", 'MacSoft and Lion are to be congratulated for the quality of this port from the PC world. Installation was a breeze, and Mac interface conventions (such as selecting menu items with the mouse, dialog boxes, and menu bars) are all there. But wait - there\'s more: The Mac version of Duke Nukem 3D offers more value and more features than the PC version did. You get levels that PC users had to purchase separately as the Plutonium Pack, including a great level set in a fast-food joint. Also, ""MacDuke"" takes advantage of some of the Mac\'s multimedia features, allowing you to switch screen resolutions on the fly (I know you can already do that, but PC users can\'t) and record taunts in your own voice for multiplayer games. One tech tip: If you find that the game suffers from occasional momentary freezes, try turning off the Music option - the freezes are most likely caused by the computer accessing the CD-ROM music tracks.', ""Speaking of multiplayer games: Duke Nukem 3D's Dukematch features are impressive. Not only can you play over a local network, you can play against one to seven enemies over IPX, AppleTalk, or TCP/IP. Head-to-head play over the Internet required only getting a competitor's IP address and typing it in to a dialog box. With a 28.8kbps modem, play was smooth and almost as good as over a local network. Duke Nukem 3D is even cross-platform networkable, so you can go kick some PC user's behind, whether locally, or across the world. One warning: unlike Marathon, Duke Nukem 3D won't send a map to all the players, so if you plan to use a third-party map, you'll have to email it to all your friends (the good news is that Duke map files work on both platforms with no modifications necessary and there are a ton of gamer-made maps available on the Web)."", 'For parents, there\'s a password-protected ""Parental Lock"" option (in the Options menu, or course). Once you set this lock, your kids will be protected from some of the more explicit violence and ""adult themes"" in Duke Nukem 3D. Then they will be free to run around and shoot things to their little hearts\' delight.', ""Speed was excellent (16-28 frames per second on a 800-x-600-pixel resolution) on a Power Mac 7600/120. On a 68040-based Mac, you'll need to reduce screen size and detail, but the game is still playable.

Steel Panthers 2: Modern Battles - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['""It wasn\'t fair,"" an Iraqi general is supposed to have said to his American captors during the Gulf War. ""We didn\'t know you were attacking until all our tanks had blown up."" <P>If you\'re like most Americans, you watched the Allied forces roll up the Iraqi army with something akin to awe. The bloody attrition of World Wars I and II and the stalemates of Korea and Vietnam culminated in the Gulf War\'s efficient, lethally precise modern warfare, and Steel Panthers II: Modern Battles captures it perfectly. Encompassing the epic sweep of post-World War II combat, from 1950 to 1999, it puts you on the battlefields that have defined this half-century of combat. <P>Steel Panthers II follows up the successful Steel Panthers, which dealt exclusively with combat in World War II. Created from a core design by wargame vets Gay Grigsby and Keith Brors, with an engine and graphics from SSI\'s special project team, SP1 had the perfect balance of playability and depth, with a large database, a wide variety of scenarios and campaigns, and the ability to create your own custom maps and scenarios. SP2 offers a similar engine with several new features, but more important is the massive new database of 1,000 modern units. Infantry, armor, artillery, and air assets are all modeled in depth, and units have characteristics unique to each time period used in the game. <P>Let\'s take a look at the engine and its refinements first. SP2 is a tactical, turn-based wargame, so it deals with small unit formations such as squads, platoons, and companies. The map is a traditional hex-grid design (you can turn a hex overlay on or off) with terrain features ranging from hills and rivers to bridges and buildings. Move your units across the map and, when an enemy unit is in range, click on the crosshairs to attack. Artillery is primarily ""off map"" and is controlled through a separate panel where you select the target and type of barrage (smoke, cluster, or high explosive shells). This panel also enables you to order air attacks. <P>There are several refinements to this system, and all improve gameplay by giving you more control over how you set up an attack. A new ""shift barrage"" feature allows you to redirect artillery fire within a certain area without waiting a turn. When ordering air attacks (and the use and modeling of air assets is far more extensive than in SP1), you can now set ingress and egress points for each flight. This means you can set up a run by an A-10 along the line of a road to catch as many enemy units in one flight as possible. (Previously, an air unit would just cross the road from any direction and hit a single spot.) Finally, you can call up a unit information screen and set the primary weapon. For example, you can choose to have an engineer use only his flame thrower, or an Apache fire just a rocket salvo rather than a Hellfire missile. All this gives a much larger range of control over battles than SP1 offered, and improves on an already solid game engine. <P>The new database shows the drastic change in the nature of warfare and the unique qualities of the modern battlefield. Scenarios take on the Korean War, the Arab-Israeli Wars, Vietnam, Afghanistan, the Gulf, and others, with full campaigns for Korea 1950, Golan Heights 1973, Germany 1980 (hypothetical height of the Cold War stuff), Desert Storm 1991, and hypothetical US versus China and US versus Japan. Something on Iran-Iraq would have been appropriate, as would a hypothetical Indo-Pakistani war, but we\'ll have to wait for those. <P>The missions and campaigns included draw from many of the major conflicts since WWII, and some yet to come. The 51 stand-alone scenarios and six full campaigns will be plenty to keep folks busy while they wait for the first expansion sets and user-made scenarios. An interesting new feature, the random battle and campaign generator, pretty much rolls a new battle on the fly as you set preferences for such things as opposing sides, time period, landscape, and so on. And, as with the first SP, the scenarios editor gives this one an infinite life. You can build maps from scratch, make orders of battle for any of the 40 countries represented, and create custom scenarios of just about anything. It ain\'t easy, but it\'s fun. <P>The weapons brought to bear in these battles highlight the evolution of technology: weapons shoot further and are more lethal, gunship support changes the whole dynamic of the battle, and never screw with an M1A1 Abrams. Little touches will thrill some wargamers. For instance, you can set the height of a chopper from landed, to nap of earth, to high altitude, each with its own uses in different situations. (At high altitude, you even see a little helicopter shadow on the ground.) Watching a tight American armored assault shred an enemy with the one-two punch of Apache and Abrams is about as cool as wargaming gets. Jungle fighting in Vietnam, with Hueys sweeping out of the sky for double envelopments, is a rare experience for computer gamers. Even better are the guided-missile vehicles and teams, which are a real trip to watch. The little map animations are as good as they were in the first SP: buildings cave in, bomb craters form, fields burn. <P>SP2 has only a few problems. Some funny pauses, lasting from five to ten seconds, seeme to happen during AI processing. AI is still hit-or-miss, but is likely to be enough for most players. If you\'re a hard-core wargamer, you\'ll probably want to try the play-by-e-mail feature, greatly improved over that in SP1. (Regrettably, true modem play is still lacking.) PBEM is more stable than it was in the original game, and a playback function now lets you watch your opponent\'s moves each turn. <P>Well, what more do you want? This is the best modern warfare game around, readily playable where TacOps isn\'t, deep enough to satisfy the most dedicated wargamer, and playable enough to please the novice. This one is going to stay on the hard drive for a long time. <I>--T. Liam McDonald </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The world leader in flight simulation for the PC pushes technology and realism beyond the horizon. With a global database of scenery and airports, pilot-tested flight models, detailed instrument panels, and a fleet of challenging aircraft, <I>Flight Simulator 98</I> is simply as real as it gets.', 'Competition is good. Microsoft Flight Simulator has long been the undisputed champion of the civil aviation sim scene, and the last four years\' worth of halfhearted upgrades led some to think that the flyboys in Redmond had given up even trying. Now, with two highly anticipated contenders on the way - Sierra\'s Pro Pilot and Looking Glass\'s Flight Unlimited 2 - Microsoft has proven itself fighting fit with a thorough retooling of the classic. <P> While flight scenery under standard hardware has been tuned, with a graphics accelerator card - the game supports Direct3D compatible cards - the graphics have become breathtaking, and it\'s no surprise that the illusion of flight is all the more convincing. Gone are the shimmer of distant scenery and the flicker of ground lights at night. Clouds are wispy and transparent, and the aliased patchwork terrain of earlier versions is now smoothly blended and vastly more realistic. Devotees will also notice more subtle graphic embellishments: Runways have skid-marks, and dawn really does now rise in the East. With the release of Windows 98, this version of Microsoft Flight Simulator will even support multiple monitors, making homemade wraparound cockpits a real (and, for spouses, terrifying) possibility. <P> Not only does the view out the window look better, there\'s more to see. Thirty North American cities are now rendered in detail, along with 15 others in Europe and Asia. Perhaps the most stunning is Hong Kong, which is faithfully represented right down to the checkerboard approach (which requires of pilots a last-minute sharp turn before landing). The Las Vegas, Hawaii, Japan, and Caribbean scenery expansion packs have been subsumed in this release, and the detail of the New York and Paris graphics exceed those of the retail enhancement add-ons. Microsoft has also made available a conversion utility for shareware scenery from earlier versions. <P> More than 3,000 airports are available for takeoffs and landings, but planning the flights in between is impossible without resorting to third-party tools; the ""database"" of navigational aids is merely a text listing of transmitters and beacons, and detailed area maps are provided only for the 45 major metropolitan airports. While this is an improvement upon the previous version - which offered no maps - it\'s still a notable shortcoming. <P> The stable of available aircraft has evolved to include fixed- and retractable-gear versions of the single-engined Cessna 182, the new Learjet 45, plus enhanced versions of the 737-400, Sopwith Camel, Schweitzer sailplane, and Extra 300S for aerobatics. For the first time, a helicopter is included: the Bell 206, which fixed-wing pilots will find an unfamiliar (and initially frustrating) flight experience. Instrument panels and controls are rendered in greater detail, right down to the realistic throttle knob on the Cessna, and the fully user-configurable keyboard layouts and joystick button assignments are a welcome addition. <P> The flight models of the aircraft are as realistic as ever, and Microsoft\'s association with FlightSafety International - a major training organization - will presumably speed acceptance of MSFS as a flight instruction tool. Included in the manual is even a coupon for a cut-rate first flying lesson from Cessna. <P> Other technical innovations include support for Force Feedback joysticks, bringing a new sensation to the PC flight sim. The experience is disconcertingly realistic - runways really are bumpy - and the rattle of the stick in a stall will send a shiver down your spine. Multiplayer support also returns, via LAN or the Internet (hosted free to players at Microsoft\'s Internet Gaming Zone). <P> Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 is an impressive feat. With a few exceptions, gone are the glaring flaws of the previous version; coupled with its technological innovations, the sum of the parts is a unique flight experience of unprecedented realism.

The fiery magnificence of the early morning launches, the tension-filled minutes leading up to lunar landings, the bizarre image of the Lunar Rover crawling across the barren landscape of the moon - these events were on the edge of both science fact and fiction, and the sheer drama surrounding them has never been rivaled. Apollo 18 tries to re-create the exhilaration of those Apollo missions by letting you take on the duties of a NASA astronaut, but about the only thing it truly succeeds at is proving there's a whole lot of tedious work that goes on behind the scenes of a moon shot."", ""Part of the reason for this tedium is the game's extremely heavy emphasis on procedure - you must activate systems at the proper time and in the correct sequence - but sloppy coding and sparse, uninspired graphics are to blame too. The first puzzler is why the game says you must run the training missions at 640x480x256, while the actual missions can apparently be played at the resolution of your choosing. It's bad enough that a product being released in the US in 1999 runs at such a low resolution, but what's more annoying is that the instructions are wrong: The training missions ran just fine even when I didn't change from my usual 800x600x16-bit resolution."", ""The training consists of numerous true/false tests and simulations, and it was during the first test that I realized that astronauts must log countless hours memorizing all the operations they have to perform - and that performing them after they've been committed to memory can be fairly monotonous. You're well advised to study the training videos provided on the Johnson Space Center disc (for some reason, all the people training you have patches for the Kennedy Space Center), but be ready with pen and paper before you view: None of this info is available elsewhere in the game or the manual, and the smallest tidbit that's mentioned in a video might pop up on your next test. Of course, the fact that the guy who's droning on about gimbal angles looks like a model from Men's Health and has a delivery as dry as moon dust means you might miss an important fact no matter how studious you are."", ""After finally passing the first written test, you move on to the launch simulator - which once again drives home how difficult commanding a space mission must be. The manual has entire sections devoted to assisting you in following the oral commands from flight control. The challenge here is knowing when to push buttons on the various control panels; it sounds boring, but the sound effects and voices from mission control as they go through the prelaunch sequence actually do charge the whole proceeding with an air of realism. As the engines make a dull roar and mission control asks you if you copy, you finally start to get the sensation of being there. The second simulation involves reentry, and while much of it's rather sterile - you mainly click buttons when you're told to - I've got to admit that I had a severe twinge of anxiety when mission control advised me of a loss-of-signal period, and I knew I'd be out of contact with them."", 'But just when things start to get a little interesting, problems crop up that constantly hamper your enjoyment. Although your progress is supposed to be saved when you exit, I found that I had to take a true/false test again (ouch!) even though I\'d already passed one and had moved on to the simulator. To be fair, it only happened once, but it was troubling nonetheless. Then there\'s the online glossary that only scrolls seven entries per mouse click: Getting to the description of ""PGNS button"" takes about 20 mouse clicks, and before long you\'ll wind up flipping through the glossary in the manual - real space-age technology, eh? And when I hit the Esc key to end a video sequence, I was kicked out to the desktop on several occasions.', ""The overriding problem with Apollo 18, though, is its static nature: You listen to a command, then click the appropriate button. Repeat this about 200 times, and you've got an idea of how thrilling things can get. Now, there are points during actual missions where unexpected events occur, and there's a palpable sense of tension and danger when you have to react on your own. But even these moments aren't nearly exciting enough to make up for the boring procedures that precede them."", ""Apollo 18 might have nailed all the procedures involved in launching a man into space, but it never really conveys the spirit of the thing - and isn't that what it's all about? <i>--Stephen Poole </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Select from eight different weapons, choose from five fields of battle, and play online with friends or as a squad member. Don't forget to wear your camo, or else you'll never know what hit you until it's too late in <I>Extreme Paint Brawl</I>."", 'In the gaming industry, the problem with a groundbreaking design is that it inevitably spawns an entire series of like-minded products, sometimes pushing the genre in new and utterly refreshing directions, but oftentimes down the same beaten path. In the case of Activision\'s Sheridan Extreme Paintbrawl, this disappointing first-person combat game pushes the genre one step too far, attempting to wed a tired game engine with the paintball phenomenon. <P>Developed by Head Games, Extreme Paintbrawl is based upon the antiquated Build engine, the very same engine used so successfully in Duke Nukem 3D. Unfortunately, Paintbrawl\'s environs are nothing like those found in Duke Nukem, by and large composed of bland corridors, uninteresting rooms, run-of-the-mill playing areas, and poorly designed maps. Although five so-called ""fields"" are included in the game - urban assault, deep space ninety, haunted forest, paint keep, and desert of death - no attempt has been made to actually model the prototypical paintball field, which is usually strewn with log dugouts, bunkers, trenches, and other assorted obstacles. Sure there\'s an occasional tree and the obligatory low wall to provide some cover, but you never actually get the sense that you are working up a sweat rolling about on a muddied paintball course. <P>As if that weren\'t enough, the AI is a mess, perhaps one of the worst attempts at modeling a team sport that I\'ve ever seen. Team members seem to dance in place, stuck against walls or caught behind open doors. Others stand idle in the middle of open areas, exposed to enemy fire whenever they come into contact with the opposing team. And, apart from switching places with other team members, frankly a rather absurd and archaic tactic to say the least given the nature of paintball combat, there doesn\'t seem to be any way to develop and implement a cohesive plan of action short of controlling each and every team member. Next, there\'s the business of telling friend from foe. It\'s far too difficult to tell one side from the other, and, under the best of circumstances, your only recourse is to duck and hide, then wait to see if the other guy starts shooting at you first. <P>The practice mode is downright laughable. Even to a layperson, it would have made sense to include a target range, whereby you could shoot at a variety of stationary or moving targets with various weapons to test and improve your marksmanship. Instead, you must pick one of five fields, then wander about the course without so much as coming into contact with the opposition. The season mode is equally appalling. You must ""hire"" your team members from a cast of ill-defined characters, spending whatever funds remain on the purchase of guns, CO2, and ammo. Mind you, there\'s no way to change the camouflage clothing for each team member for the different types of terrain in the game, pass out more ammunition should they run out of paint pellets, or assign them individual orders prior to the start of play. <P>To make matters worse, Extreme Paintbrawl is, if anything, extremely buggy, crashing more times than I care to remember whenever one of my warriors was hit. At times, it also appeared as if splotches of paint were hanging in midair, waiting for someone to just walk into them. Frankly, I can\'t help but wonder how this game ever passed its beta test. All things considered, Extreme Paintbrawl is perhaps one of the worst games I\'ve seen in years, as much out of touch with reality as it is out of step with the gaming world at large.<I>--Marc Dultz</I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Independence War,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Set in 2268, <i>Independence War</i> lets the player assume the role of an up-and-coming Commonwealth Navy officer caught in the middle of an interstellar skirmish. Colonists separated from Earth have assembled a fleet of commercial and mining ships and a few stolen military vessels. It's up to the player to take command of a 150-meter Dreadnought-class Corvette, quell the rebellion, and restore order.<P> Throughout the game's many levels, the player will need quick reflexes, a sharp eye, and strategic thinking to master the intricacies of piloting to defeat the enemy."", 'The crafty captain who deftly commands the crew of a starship to outwit a seemingly overwhelming force is a well-known fixture in many science fiction tales. To date, no computer game developer has successfully created a game that convincingly allows players to assume the role of that captain. Interplay\'s recently released Starfleet Academy opted to give capital ships flight models and weaponry that made the behemoths behave as if they were wanna-be X-wing fighters. But Independence War is the real deal. Independence War not only provides the most detailed flight and systems modeling yet seen in a space sim, it also provides a complex, rewarding plot and a fully fleshed-out gaming world. <P>In Independence War you play the captain of a small capital ship, a Corvette burdened with a far-too-impressive name, the ""Dreadnought."" As the game starts, Earth is in the midst of a decades-old guerrilla war with the colorful Indies, a haphazard collection of former colonists who have rejected Earth rule and formed their own political organization. Your character is a neophyte captain in Earth\'s Commonwealth Navy, and you\'re given an introduction to the Indie/Commonwealth conflict through an impressive 14-minute-long opening animated cutscene. The game\'s developers put so much effort into the introduction that upon viewing it I was immediately concerned that there wouldn\'t be enough other cutscenes of comparable quality within the actual game. I couldn\'t have been more wrong. The game is literally riddled with quality animated cutscenes and other scripted events within missions, which expand upon the game\'s introduction and advance the game\'s plot. Each of the other members of your bridge crew has a well-developed personality and contributes appropriate advice or comments during missions. A number of other space sims have had well-developed storylines, but Independence War has so many scripted events and plot developments within missions that the game almost feels like it is as much an adventure game as a space sim. The storyline is always compelling, and occasionally interactive, as your character\'s mission choices and decisions made within missions can dramatically alter game events. <P>There are four bridge stations in the game: command, navigation, weapons, and engineering. At the command station you\'ll access mission briefings and be able to assume remote control over other vessels, and at the engineering station you can give orders to four repair crews and adjust power settings within the ship. You\'ll spend the bulk of your time, however, at the navigation and weapons stations. The navigation station provides you with a convenient screen to guide the ship, pick waypoints, and assign targets. The weapons station gives you the opportunity to see a third-person-perspective wire-frame view of your ship, allowing you to keep your current target always in view and to effectively fight enemies who are attacking you from a variety of angles. Your ship can trek through space using basic thrusters, using an exponentially faster Linear Displacement Drive system, which is convenient for intrasystem travel, or by using handy LaGrange points to warp to other star systems using a Capsule ""faster than light"" Drive system. <P>While the ship\'s misleading name may invoke images of a mighty space behemoth, the Dreadnought is instead a modestly durable vessel with an outstanding ""team o\' Scotties"" repair crew and some fairly basic weaponry. You have both a forward-firing particle cannon and missile bank and rear counterparts to the two weapons. The forward-firing cannon is on the right-hand side of your ship and initially feels a bit unbalanced and awkward to veteran gamers who are more accustomed to a fighter\'s duel gunned approach. Cannons will automatically track opponents within a certain range, although you can override that tracking by opting for a more rapid-fire, but unguided, attack. <P>The graphics in Independence War are excellent, although strangely enough that might not be immediately apparent once you boot up the game. Since the game\'s physics system frequently results in you travelling in a direction other than the one your ship is facing, the Dreadnought\'s Heads Up Display (HUD) displays a series of directional lines at all times to help keep you oriented. Similarly, other ships leave a ""ladder-like"" trail behind them on your HUD, allowing you to quickly visually judge their speeds and headings. While you can turn off the HUD, you likely won\'t want to lose all of the information it provides, and as a result, the game\'s impressive 3D graphics are somewhat obscured. Perhaps to alleviate this effect somewhat, the game will switch automatically to a full-screen third-person perspective in certain circumstances, such as when your ship docks with another vessel or travels through a capsule-drive warp point. The game\'s software-rendering mode is good, but to fully appreciate the graphics you\'ll, as usual, require a 3D graphics-accelerator board. Only native Glide support is included, so you\'ll need a Voodoo Graphics or Voodoo 2 card (even a Voodoo Rush card won\'t necessarily work properly) to see all of the pretty pictures. <P>Not every ship system or game feature that the development team included works well. The engineering and command stations are infrequently used, and I suspect that Particle Systems had more ambitious plans for the engineering station and the detailed, and celestially accurate, star chart that is accessible from the command station. Wingman commands are also fairly perfunctory. You\'re prevented from dividing up your forces to achieve a series of objectives, as you can only issue one order to your wingmen at a time, and all available wingmen will scramble to obey that order even if you would tactically be better off keeping some wingmen in their current positions. Force-feedback support is included, but it\'s only modestly utilized, especially when compared with the prolific feedback effects in Descent: Freespace. <P>Finally, the game\'s biggest strength is also one of its weaknesses. The game\'s missions contain original objectives and are generally far more detailed and involving than those of any other game in the genre. Unfortunately they sometimes suffer from overscripting, where the only way to advance the mission is to take a specific, occasionally unintuitive or finicky, triggering action. Allowing your ship to get pounded by your enemies just to advance the mission just feels wrong, and yet that\'s exactly what you have to do in one mission. The scripting also very much gives the missions a ""puzzle-like"" feel, where you have to figure out the trick to a mission before you have a reasonable opportunity of success. Since no space sim yet has allowed gamers to effectively save the game within a mission, it\'s not surprising that Independence War similarly excludes this feature, but its omission was even more noticeable than normal because of the length of some of the missions in the game. In the end, I found that the strength of the mission design in Independence War was the main reason that the game stands out above other games in the genre, but I was still occasionally frustrated by mission overscripting. <P>Independence War is easily the best simulation of a large spacecraft yet, and its originality is extremely refreshing in a genre that is quickly becoming crowded. If you\'re willing to cope with Independence War\'s steep learning curve and invest some time in learning the nuances of the game, you\'ll ultimately have a very rewarding and unique experience. <I>--Desslock </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

By all means a good title, there\'s one big problem that arises only after repeated hours of play: the questions repeat, and repeat ... and repeat. Frankly, the resurfacing of questions--there are only about 200 total--was the only way we made it to a million dollars, but we can see that not everyone sees this as an enjoyable ""asset."" The justification from the manufacturer is that the package is at a low price and was never meant for hard-core gamers (or people who install the game on multiple machines). But even for just twenty dollars, you\'ll wind up being <i>really</i> sure how many stock make up the Dow 500 after five to ten hours of game play, and may walk away annoyed. People looking to purchase this game for multiplayer action also won\'t be pleased, since players who have spent time with the game will be at an advantage to climb to higher dollar amounts.<P> The best elements of the real-life game show through: in particular, Regis and his friendly-yet-sarcastic commentary.

With more inflection, and as if you\'re nuts, he adds: ""That\'s your answer?"" Then he bellows: ""You are correct!"" With touches like these, players really do feel like they\'re in the hot seat.

Just like the show, the easy questions soon dissipate into the more challenging, with topics revolving around things like the United Nations Security Council. The same lifelines are also in place, but instead of calling on your own support person--who\'s most likely standing behind your shoulder, ready to play the next round--you\'re saddled with Regis\'s own friends. (He seems to travel in a pretty uneducated crowd, since they provided wrong answers much of the time, tripping us up.)', ""Another warning: this isn't really a multiplayer game in the true sense of the word.

So while you can command your forces from a top-down perspective, you can, if you so choose, watch the action unfold from the ground level by hopping into and controlling any of the ground and air units in your charge."", 'You begin each scenario by selecting your battle group from a finite number of units, deciding how many infantryman, armored personnel carriers, tanks, and helicopters will be placed within your ""Webspace"" in order to accomplish your immediate objectives. Next, you must then choose which predefined entry point will serve as your forces\' starting location, taking into consideration the mission goals, terrain, and locale of each objective. Once the entry point has been determined, the battle group is deployed en masse at the entry point and, for better or worse, sometimes seconds away from an opening engagement with the enemy. While this heightens the overall experience and adds a sense of impending peril to every situation, I can\'t for the life of me figure out why you aren\'t given the opportunity to deploy your forces prior to the start of a mission or why you are unable to split up your forces so that they arrive at multiple entry points. Bear in mind that once a scenario begins it usually takes a couple of minutes to assess the battlefield and assign each unit its waypoint orders. Unfortunately, there doesn\'t seem to be a way to issue specific orders to a unit - such as patrol a region or defend a critical installation - or have them seek cover when a firefight erupts. Worse still, the group command seems ungainly given the current state of game design, and because the units start out bunched together in a tight formation, oftentimes they require multiple orders before they set off in differing directions.', 'From a game-playing standpoint, Wargasm is certainly one of the more demanding combat simulations available today, requiring intense concentration, physical as well as mental dexterity, and incredible patience to emerge victorious. All too often, the typical battle devolves into a brutal slugfest, with you haphazardly jumping around from unit to unit attempting to engage and destroy the enemy instead of making the best use of your available forces. And given the nature and intensity of the conflict, the incorporation of multiple points of view within a vehicle leads to a situation known as ""work overload,"" whereby you have to wear too many hats and fulfill far too many functions to succeed.', ""Furthermore, from a ground-level perspective, it isn't always clear when you are driving the vehicle and when you are operating its guns. In retrospect, it probably would've made more sense to incorporate all of the vehicular functions within a singular crew station, thereby alleviating the need to constantly shift back and forth between the crew positions and removing some of the guesswork as to what system is, in fact, being operated. I was also stymied by some of the weaponry's effects. For instance, an infantryman can raze barbed-wire obstacles with sweeping machinegun fire, but a tank isn't able to destroy a simple tank trap or dragon's teeth with its cannon."", ""And then there's the user interface. For some reason, you are limited to using one of five predefined controller sets, unable to remap or reconfigure the individual key and joystick commands as in the typical 3D shooter. Again, this leads to some confusing situations where it isn't always clear which key or joystick command is used to aim and fire the weaponry and which controls movement. Furthermore, to move from unit to unit, you must return to the tactical map, locate the unit you wish to control, then double-click on it, a tedious procedure that has a pronounced impact on gameplay and leads to more confusion. I'm not sure exactly why the designers opted to go with this method for commanding and controlling, but suffice it to say the end result leaves a lot to be desired."", ""So, while Wargasm manages to capture the intensity and flavor of tactical-level firefights, and marks the debut of Digital Image Design's especially impressive 3-Dream graphics technology, the clumsy interface and frenetic gameplay undermine what could have been an extraordinary real-time wargame. <i>--Marc Dultz </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Worms 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>Worms2</i> is a turn-based game in which up to 8 players can participate. You command a platoon of worms that inhabit a randomly generated terrain, and you must destroy the other worms with an assortment of devastating weapons. Each turn is limited to a set number of seconds. The time limit allows you to position your worm in a nearby safe place, collect one of the bonus items sprinkled around, or go to attack a neighboring worm. Battle continues until only one team of worms remains; otherwise, after 30 minutes of mayhem, death, and destruction, a draw occurs.', 'Each platoon of worms is given an assortment of weapons, tools, and utilities with which to dispose of the enemy in any way necessary. Players can reconfigure platoon weapons for each game to create war zones.', 'Use the Internet to challenge players in the next town, country, or continent.', ""A perfect sequel, <i>Worms 2</i> keeps all of the charm that made <i>Worms</i> so appealing while adding more weapons, more levels, and more funny little voices. What makes the title so engrossing is just how simple the interface is and how easy it is to bring friends, be they gamers or not, into a game. Teams can spend from ten minutes to ten hours marching their worms around a 2D map and attempting to annihilate each other. The turn-based gameplay doesn't slow the feel down at all, and the action is always fast and hilarious. It's not often that a game comes along that's as simple as it is satisfying, but here's <i>Worms 2</i> with proof that it can be done. Like the original <i>Worms</i>, this is a turn-based strategy game that has an arcade feel to it, but it's wickedly intuitive, funny, and challenging. It's nothing fancy; just some worms, some weapons, and a sense of humor mingled with a classic contest of kill-or-be-killed."", ""But these aren't your everyday, garden-variety worms: These are animated Rambo-style worms whose antics bring tons of charm to this cutesy little game. As you begin each game your worms (up to eight on a team) are randomly placed on the landscape along with the opposing teams, and during your turn, you simply try to destroy the other teams' worms using a multitude of inventive weapons. Last worm standing wins--that's all there is to it."", ""Though the concept is amazingly simple, <i>Worms 2</i> is consistently challenging. Each worm begins with 100 hit points, and the goal is to wear each enemy worm down to zero, killing them before they can do the same to you. During each turn, you select a worm, equip him with the weapon you want him to use, then aim and fire--but don't take too long; the clock is ticking. Luckily, the controls are kept simple; just use the cursor keys to move your worm around the map and target your opponent, then hit the spacebar to blast away. The weapons range from a simple shotgun to full-blown air strikes and hilarious killers like the super banana bomb, holy hand grenade, and homing sheep."", ""But it isn't just point-and shoot-mayhem. You'll have to carefully select which weapons you want to use and when. Many of the advanced weapons are strictly rationed (you may only get one of each), and if used improperly can do as much damage to your own worms as to others."", ""Some of the new weapons are pretty wild. There's the super sheep, a steerable flying ewe of destruction; a mad cow stampede; and--one of my favorites--the old woman who ambles around the map complaining about the price of tea and mumbling about the good old days, then explodes."", ""There's an almost child-like appeal in blowing up these worms. It's such a basic, simplistic game: no complex strategies, a single mission doesn't take more than ten minutes, and there's an infinite variety of maps. But, most importantly, <i>Worms 2</i> delivers a hearty dose of good old-fashioned fun, and for that it comes heartily recommended. -- <i>DailyRadar Review</i><br /><br />Every now and then a game comes along that is addictive, challenging, and entertaining all at the same time and yet can't really be explained as such to someone who hasn't played the game. Worms 2 is such a game. I have started this review seven times now, and each time I've been thwarted by the difficulty of explaining exactly why blowing the crap out of armless, legless cartoon characters with ridiculously overpowered weaponry is as much fun as it is. But that's my job, so here goes."", ""First, the somewhat empirical description of the game: Worms 2 is a 2D turn-based strategy game that puts you in command of a team of worms armed with predetermined amounts of arms and ammunition and sets you out on a fully destructible battleground to kill one or more similarly armed enemy teams. Every so often a care package will fall from the sky and can be collected by your soldiers. These packages contain health, new weaponry, or a bomb (these you don't want). On each turn, you select one of your worms, move it around on the screen with your arrow keys, select a weapon or tool, aim, and determine the amount of force you want to put into the shot. Some of the weapons included - like the bazooka or shotgun - have an immediate effect, and others - like the grenade - have a timer that will tick off before detonation. That's it, there's nothing more you need to know to play this game. Pretty simple, eh?"", ""So why is Worms 2 so much fun to play? That answer comes in several parts. First off, the simple rules and basic control structure make it a game that anyone can learn to play in about five minutes (now that you've read this review it won't even take you that long). Even so, the well-designed physics model ensures that the longer you practice, the better you'll get (if you think you're going to be able to hit a target across screen by lobbing a three-second grenade on your first try, you're dreaming). This minute-to-learn-lifetime-to-master kind of setup is the most basic component of making a game that people will want to play again and again."", ""The second great thing about Worms 2 is that it appeals to the destructive side in all of us. Everything in the game can be destroyed: ground, girders, houses... whatever. This not only opens up a whole new world of strategic play options (why waste a lot of time shooting someone over and over when you can just destroy the ground underneath him?), it's also pleasing to your inner child who has secretly missed shooting his Star Wars figures with a BB gun for years. The battlefield's changing nature gives you a feeling of control over your surroundings, another great feature to be included in the game design primer."", 'Thirdly, Worms 2 is funny. From the artwork and animation that feature these bloodthirsty little critters shooting, punching, and blasting one another to kingdom come, to the brilliant sound effects that let you customize the voices of your worms to everything from a 007 wanna-be to a Scottish killer, the game does everything in its power to keep you laughing as you play. When done correctly, this too is another feature of great games.', ""Finally, Worms 2 is a great multiplayer game. Whether you're playing at home with some of your friends (and with up to 18 players by hot seat, you're a lot more likely to run out of friends than you are to run out of game slots) or playing over the Internet (up to six players here), the game is designed to let as many players as possible get into some competition that's impossible not to love. Since the game also allows you to change screens, weapon options, and about a billion other things (a slight exaggeration, but let's just say more than I want to count) about the way the game plays, you can always set up a game that's different enough from the last time you played to be interesting."", ""Reading about Worms 2 is no comparison to playing it. This is one of those games that, even if it doesn't sound that great on paper (or onscreen... whatever), is still worth purchasing on faith alone. If you're interested in action or strategy games, and you're looking for a title that you'll still be gathering friends around to play well into the next year, Worms 2 is the game for you. <i>--Trent C.

Players fly a series of sorties over the Red Sea, Eritrea, and Saudi Arabia with scenery ranging from deep deserts to lush valleys.', 'There was a time, not too long ago, when you could count on one hand all of the civil and combat flight simulations released within any given 12-month period. In fact, ardent flight sim enthusiasts were known to snap up every simulation that cruised down the runway, regardless of its perceived faults. Gaming has certainly changed over the past few years, particularly in the realm of modern air combat sims. Case in point: In the past seven months, no fewer than four F-22 simulations have surfaced, each purportedly marketed as the definitive portrayal of America\'s latest low-observable, stealth technology-driven aircraft. <P>In F-22 Air Dominance Fighter, Digital Image Design has crafted the latest and perhaps the most exacting reproduction of the USAF\'s all-new air supremacy/strike fighter. Incorporating lessons learned from EF2000 - F-22 ADF\'s critically acclaimed predecessor - data gleaned from various declassified sources, as well as notional depictions of certain next-generation avionics systems and weaponry, F-22 ADF may be, as DID proudly advertises, the most sophisticated yet equally absorbing air combat simulation ever to be conceived. <P>The F-22 aircraft portrayed in the game seems responsive and accurately modeled, dutifully illustrating every important facet of the actual aircraft. A wide array of internal and external viewing perspectives has been included, not to mention several EMCON levels, which are intended to automatically monitor and adjust the aircraft\'s in-flight stealth profile. Heck, even a few UFO\'s manage to put in a cameo appearance, vying for the dubious distinction of being called the preeminent air dominance fighter! <P>Furthermore, F-22 ADF has an awful lot of enticing features that are sure to make a few heads whip around in awe. For starters, you can slowly immerse yourself within the overall framework, learning all of the intricate aspects and capabilities of the F-22 - as well as its present and future adversaries - thanks to a rich, full-featured simulator; a comprehensive, well-written manual; and an equally impressive World Air Power journal. If you prefer, you can kick the tires and light the fires of the F-22 that much sooner, tearing up the skies over the troubled Middle East in the ""kill-or-be-killed"" quick combat mode. Here, you are initially confronted by a litany of inept enemy ground and air defenses, which become increasingly more adroit - and obviously more lethal - as time wears on, perhaps spanning an incredible five-hour timeframe. For the more adventurous, you may enlist in one of three tours of duty, each depicting a simmering hotbed of tension - ready to explode in the not-too-distant future - in and around the perilous Red Sea region. <P>Although you assume command of several superstealthy F-22 fighters, there are several missions in which you must hand off your responsibilities as a squadron commander and step aboard a loitering AWACs aircraft operating miles behind the FEBA. On these occasions, you are charged with monitoring air and ground activity within the immediate battle sector, eventually vectoring friendly air, land, and naval assets to troubled areas in the most timely and efficient manner. In addition, you can, for the first time, experience the trials and tribulations of engaging in midair refueling with high-flying KC-35 tankers. Even the Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) is excellent. <P>Unfortunately, there are several troubling issues that warrant some cause for concern. For instance, although radio chatter is made out to depict English-speaking foreign nationals, the audio seems especially distorted, even during relatively low-intensity moments. If it weren\'t for the inclusion of accompanying onscreen text, I dare say most players would deem these messages virtually unintelligible and utterly ineffectual. Furthermore, the utilization of canned missions means that you must continually fight and refight the same pre-scripted battles over and over until you somehow manage to meet the mission goals. The omission of a mission planner and the inability to alter an aircraft\'s weapons loadout prior to mission startup only serves to compound rather than correct these oversights. Lastly, the lack of a customizable mission editor for hypothetical air-to-air combat setups and the exclusion of a mission builder are, at best, inexplicable, especially when one compares and contrasts F-22 ADF with other simulations competing for the same consumer dollar. <P>Undoubtedly, DID\'s upcoming F-22 Total Air War - the sequel to F-22 ADF - will address most, if not all, of these shortcomings, integrating a host of important upgrades and other ""on-the-drawing-board"" enhancements to this near rock-solid simulation. For now, though, you will just have to smack your lips and remain patient as you strap into the most engrossing F-22 simulation to roll down the war-ravaged tarmac.<I>--Marc Dultz</I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Despite some historical inaccuracies, an over-simplified naval combat model, and some other flaws, it still delivers a lot of entertainment for the money.', ""Players can cut their teeth on one of the stand-alone scenarios to get a feel for the revamped ground combat model and the entirely new naval warfare rules, but that's all just preparation for the involved historical campaigns that really make this a game worth keeping. Despite the game's theme, we had more fun with the battles involving a lot of ground units than we had with the purely naval conflicts. That's not to say the naval conflicts weren't fun. Sneaking up on an aircraft carrier battle group with a few submerged submarines is always a lot of fun, and staging air strikes from the carriers really adds a lot to amphibious operations. Whether you have an interest in the period or just like a good war game that doesn't take months of research and practice to master, <I>Pacific General</I> blows similar games out of the water in terms of pure fun. <i>--T.

But the old gray mare still has enough breath left for one final gasp, and it\'s a pretty good one, too. <P>Panzer General, released over two years ago, is the most successful wargame of all time, with over a quarter million units sold. A series of good, but less successful, sequels followed in the ""5-Star Series"": Allied General, Fantasy General, Star General, and now Pacific General. Each improved the engine a bit, and each was a fine game in its own right despite some rough spots. <P>Pacific General is the last hurrah before SSI moves on to Panzer General II and a whole new series of wargames. It does exactly what it sets out to do - give us all of World War II in the Pacific - and then some. If the engine has some quirks and the graphics are beginning to look wan, then think of it like that tattered, dotty old uncle who still has some good tales to tell. <P>In Pacific General, you can take on the role of either the Axis or the Allied in a series of single scenarios or a full-blown campaign. Everything from the invasions of China and Burma and the attack on Pearl Harbor to the hypothetical invasions of the Japanese mainland (Operation Olympic) and San Francisco are here. Orders of battle for the Japanese, Americans, British, Chinese, and minor nations are included for with infantry, armor, artillery, naval, and air units. <P>Like its predecessors, Pacific General is a grand strategic game with a charming simplicity. The idea is to get novice gamers playing as quickly and easily as possible. Naturally, this is anathema to grognards who demand realism and accuracy (yet who keep playing despite their bitching). Think of it like Milton Bradley\'s Axis and Allies: a simplified game that gives you the flavor of sweeping conquest without the attention to detail. Combined forces attacks are out, and gameplay is a matter of moving a unit, then firing, then moving another unit, and so on. It\'s this ease of play that has made the series such a success. <P>PacGen introduces some innovations that give us a tantalizing glimpse of what Panzer General II has in store. The most prominent of these is the attention to naval warfare, which played a large role in the Pacific. Naval units occupy more than a single hex and can suffer ""critical hits."" These signify damage to the structure itself, and can be repaired in a special repair mode. Aircraft can be placed on CAP to protect ships from air attacks. Submarines can now be submerged for attack, with just their periscopes showing above the surface. Aircraft carriers can now be ""opened"" to reveal a deck full of fighters ready for launching. The interface is a bit cumbersome, and the means of repairing damaged aircraft at sea is obscure, but the innovation allows for grand naval battles like Pearl Harbor, Midway, Coral Sea, Guadalcanal, and the Marianas Turkey Shoot to be re-created with some level of skill. <P>Combined force attacks are also handled with more finesse. You can move a unit, then move another, then go back and fire with the first. By surrounding enemy units, you get on the attack, bringing the system closer to true combined forces tactics. The AI isn\'t tactically brilliant, but it\'s pretty tenacious and keeps on punching without the gross cheating of the original. More to the point is the native TCP/IP support for Internet play, which lets you square off against real opponents. <P>The campaigns and scenarios are top-notch, just tough enough to require a few tries, but not insane like those in the original. There is a major screw-up in the campaign engine, however. When you win a battle, you\'re taken to the deployment screen for the next battle, but you can\'t save. You have to choose the next battle, and deploy, and then begin the scenario before you can save, which means you better get that deployment right the first time or you\'re screwed. <P>Most interesting of all is a battle generator which gives you access to all the maps and units from PacGen, and most from Panzer General and Allied General. Though you can\'t edit maps, you can create custom scenarios, right down to the victory requirements, weather, units entrenchment and strength levels, and purchase points. <P>A few annoyances keep PacGen at a modest level of frustration. The manual reaches new heights of imponderability. It is not so much that it is written badly, as that it is laid out in such a way that it\'s hard to tell just what they\'re talking about at any given moment. There are too many clicks required for too many functions. The lack of a save game in the review battlefield mode is a major problem. The map graphics are pretty pitiful. When I entered the Burma battle in the Japanese campaign I was given a number of warships to deploy, but nowhere to deploy them, and that battle couldn\'t use naval power anyway. During the Singapore attack, when I could have actually used these ships, they were nowhere to be seen. Some little bugs crop up here and there, particularly in the purchase screen, where units sometimes appear and disappear. Throughout extensive play, however, PacGen never crashed once. <P>But the sheer fun factor of fighting these battles is enough to overcome the little nuisances. I mean, wargamers played Grigsby\'s Pacific War, which featured the most user-hating interface of all time. PacGen may not have that level of detail, but it captures this massive, sprawling conflict in an engaging, entertaining game. It\'s a worthy finish to a distinguished series.<I>--T.

Nascar 2000,,['ps1'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""NASCAR 2000 re-creates the sport of NASCAR racing more accurately than any game ever has. Sure, NASCAR 99 did an amazing job of re-creating the sport, but with new options and features like interactive pit stops, a draft meter, and hi-res graphics, NASCAR 2000 is truly a much better game for die-hard NASCAR fans and casual fans alike.  <P>You can play as one of 33 real-life NASCAR drivers, including Dale Jarrett, Mark Martin, and Jeff Gordon. Included in the lineup are a handful of racing rookies and legends, like Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Tony Stewart. A new create-a-driver option has also been added. <P>The drivers still have their actual cars, and you can tweak them in tons of different categories. These adjustments change the car's performance in various categories, like top speed and acceleration. You have control over everything, from individual tire pressures, to gear ratios, to the angle of your rear spoiler. There are tons of stuff to mess with, and if you have the game on a higher difficulty setting, these car tweaks can mean the difference between winning and losing. The beginner setting, however, is quite forgiving, which is great for the casual NASCAR fan who just wants to race. You can race on 18 real NASCAR venues that accurately re-creates each turn and straightaway with amazing accuracy. Plus, five road course have been added this year to make the game a bit more fun. <P>Graphically, NASCAR 2000 is a whole lot better than the previous game. The game runs in a higher resolution, and the game doesn't look washed out, like NASCAR 99. The paint jobs look very authentic, as do the tracks and backgrounds. The game still has neat visual effects like paint smudges on walls, tire marks on the track, and nice lighting effects in the night races. <P>The sound effects and music in NASCAR 2000 more than get the job done. The sound effects of the engines and cars scraping against the wall and each other are all very realistic. Your pit crew gives you instructions and advice over the radio while announcers call the action on the track. <P>Playing NASCAR 2000 is really quite addicting, even if you're not a huge follower of NASCAR. With every race you see your season point totals rise and your cash earnings grow. The records in the game show who has finished first more times than anyone in a season and who has finished in the top five the most. What's more, it gives you hard, yet attainable goals that you can conquer with a little determination and a whole lot of focus. <P>The control is great - it's super responsive whether you're using the Dual Shock analog pad or a regular pad. The addition of the draft meter really makes playing the game a whole lot more fun. It lets you know when you're holding a line right behind the car in front of you and benefiting from the draft effect. The meter makes battling for every position more of a science, instead of just an exercise in holding a line and hoping to catch up. The rearview mirror toggles on and off, so you can flip it on from time to time to check for cars that might be coming up from behind. <P>In the end, NASCAR 2000 is a better version of last year's title with more than enough new options and features to warrant a purchase by anyone who already owns NASCAR 99. If you're a fan of NASCAR and want the best NASCAR game for the PlayStation, this is the one to get. However, if you are simply a racing-game fan who's looking for a new game, keep in mind that NASCAR 2000, while definitely one of the best NASCAR simulations ever, is still all about driving in circles until your eyes bleed. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

All of this will be delivered in 3-D, with hardware acceleration required for the game's 3-D terrain, the fully polygonal units, and the dynamic lighting and environment effects. <i>Machines</i> offers everything you've been waiting for in a 3-D RTS game."", ""If we are to believe movies like Terminator, humankind's destiny ends in destruction at the hands of nefarious machines. If this is to be, let's hope the hyperintelligent robotic brains look to late-20th-century real-time-strategy artificial intelligence to govern their military tactics. At least we might have a fighting chance. Case in point: Acclaim and Charydbis' Machines. This 3D real-time strategy game features enough dazzling visuals for several games of its type, but it's hampered by its been-there-done-that gameplay and poor unit intelligence."", 'After the fourth world war, humankind\'s biggest threat becomes overcrowding, as significant medical advances double the life-expectancy rate. When the need for additional resources arises, humans launch numerous ""seeder ships"" and machines to colonize and harvest alien worlds. A hundred years pass; the machines continue to collect resources and evolve, but humans never arrive to join them. Exhausting all resources, the machines move on to additional worlds, and, after many years, two machine ""races"" encounter one another in a distant star system. During the confrontation, an artificial intelligence defect causes a galactic war to break out among the machines.', 'Machines follows basic real-time strategy principles and only breaks the mold with its 3D engine and camera angles. Gameplay involves collecting building material units (BMUs), then utilizing them to research new technology and construct military and builder units. Several basic units are provided, with the more powerful constructors and offensive machines residing high up the technology tree. Unlike the similar Warzone 2100, Machines places greater emphasis on resource collecting and base management. Transports, locator bots, smelters, and mines must be constructed to keep the BMUs flowing and your coffers full.', ""It's obvious the age of 3D real-time strategy games has finally arrived; Machines' 3D-accelerator-only engine boosts some impressive special effects. Units are completely three-dimensional, and most are wonderfully animated, particularly the spider-like reaper and the intimidating gorilla (one of the coolest-looking RTS units ever). Those are the standouts, though, as many other units look extremely similar to each other and lack discernable features. Unit weapon effects fare better, with a scattering of bright laser beams and smoke-trailing missiles, all with ample doses of colored lighting and adequate sound effects. Terrain features are sparse, with only the occasional small hill or valley to liven things up, and terrain height appears to have little effect on strategy or unit abilities."", ""The visuals really shine in Machines' two free-floating-camera options. Included are the zenith camera, the default isometric perspective providing the best view of base layout, and the ground camera, a field-level perspective that places you in the middle of the action. But, while the ground camera provides an amazing viewpoint, core game elements, like base and resource management, become nearly impossible. Machines also features a first-person perspective and, much like Activision's action/strategy hybrid Battlezone, lets you hop into and control any of your units. Again, an intriguing gimmick, but one that's not useful, or integral, to gameplay - the machines are too sluggish to control effectively, and you have no way of controlling other base functions while in this view."", ""Where Machines falters most is in the single-player campaign and unit intelligence. The solo missions feel more like loosely connected skirmish levels than a cleverly woven campaign. With little continuity (often you must research the same technology over and over across several missions) and even less storytelling, Machines' solo offering lacks the rewards to inspire you to continue onward."", 'As for unit intelligence, the computer-controlled opponent offers little challenge, typically tossing a wave of two or three units at your defenses, rarely doing significant damage until later levels when the quantities are greater and the technologies more powerful. Unfortunately, your own troops aren\'t much better. A simple three-setting ""initiative"" meter can be adjusted, but it doesn\'t affect important gameplay aspects like BMU transports moving to a new mine once their designated resource has been exhausted or a healing machine acting on its own to mend your troops. Instead, they just sit there, waiting patiently for your orders.', ""Poor unit pathfinding, a bane of real-time strategies, rears its ugly head once again. BMU transports move slow and often get hung up on one another and other base structures when trying to reach their assigned mine or smelter. Further, when ordering your military units around the map, getting them to actually follow the order can be a patience-trying task. Units will stop for no apparent reason or navigate so poorly around objects or terrain features that they'll fall significantly behind the rest of the pack. And the lumbering, mech-like gorilla seems to occasionally walk on an invisible treadmill, a frustrating occurrence during a hectic battle. Pathfinding issues are compounded when engaging in one of the indoor missions; the structure's layout, filled with narrow corridors and tight doorways, is enough to send your machines into pathfinding overload."", 'Pitting your Machines skills against up to four human opponents can be accomplished over modem, serial, LAN, or TCP/IP connection. In addition to those protocols, a matchmaking lobby has been set up at Microsoft\'s Internet Gaming Zone - so finding an online adversary shouldn\'t be too difficult. Multiplayer gameplay has some interesting features, such as the spy unit, which can covertly plant explosives in enemy structures, and the need to build special locator units to discover resources. Numerous options and game styles (including ""gorilla jousting"") help diversify the action and strategy, but apart from the 3D engine and colorful visuals, not much new ground has been broken here. There\'s only one army of machines to choose from - though the colors are different, each player receives the same units and technology tree.', ""For players new to the real-time strategy genre, Machines might be a worthy entry point. The single-player game starts off quite easy and doesn't really offer a challenge until well into the campaign. Veteran players, however, won't be impressed, apart from the camera angles and pyrotechnics, and will be less forgiving of the game's pathfinding and AI shortcomings. <i>--Doug Radcliffe </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Introducing <i>Microsoft Baseball 2000</i>--Major League ball the way you want it--when you want it. Find all the teams, stadiums, and players, officially licensed from Major League Baseball and the MLBPA. Get ready to ""play ball"" right into the next millenium!', 'Microsoft Baseball 2000 includes a number of enhancements and new features that make it better than the original (Microsoft Baseball 3D). Unfortunately, the game still suffers from a number of bugs, design flaws, and gameplay issues that keep it at the bottom of the pack among arcade baseball games. <P>First, the good news. Last year, Microsoft boasted some of the best graphics in the baseball genre, and if there\'s one area in which the game continues to shine this year, it\'s the graphics. The lush 3D engine features some of the best player models around, complete with eerily lifelike facial features and skin tones. The animations are excellent for the most part, though the transitions between multiple animations are so choppy and ludicrous that they make each game look as though it\'s being played by a bunch of robots. In particular, the pitcher walking back onto the mound after covering a base looks ridiculous (he runs to the mound then slams to a halt and climbs tiny invisible stairs to the pitching rubber in near slow-motion). <P>Still, the game does an excellent job of re-creating the look of a real baseball game. The 3D stadiums are well modeled and, for the most part, accurate. They convey a great sense of depth too, which is something that is often missing in computer baseball games. The play-by-play is very good also, though it still sounds as if it\'s being recorded in a small cardboard box. Many of the comments are humorous, and all of them are in context, which is impressive. The game even has a sizeable library of rivalry anecdotes to spice up some of your matchups. <P>Gameplay is much improved over the previous version simply because WizBang! built in some midrange difficulty levels. The batting difficulty, for example, now includes a middle setting so that you don\'t have to go with just basic (which is laughably easy) or advanced (which is still very, very difficult). The batting interface is still a strong point, in fact, though it is tough to precisely move the batter\'s aiming box with a typical gamepad. Triple Play 2000\'s toggle, which centers automatically when you release the pad, is much more intuitive even if it doesn\'t create quite the same level of realism. But for all its awkwardness, the Microsoft Baseball 2000 batting system does generate an exceptionally realistic array of hits, foul balls, and whiffs. No other baseball game, including 3DO\'s impressive High Heat Baseball 2000, has as many varied hit locations and velocities as this one. The pitching interface, by the way, is the best around without a doubt. It may take a while to warm up to it, but after some practice, you should be able to appreciate the way it adds elements of pressure and unpredictability to your pitching - good stuff. The gunshot effect has to go, though - nobody in the MLB is really capable of throwing at 120 miles per hour, after all. <P>Fielding is very tough, though you can have the computer do it for you. Unfortunately, the computer makes a lot of boneheaded plays on your behalf and, on numerous occasions, simply refuses to move toward a ball at all (and there is apparently no override option that lets you assume control in these situations). Computer-assisted baserunning, as with most computer baseball games, is problematic and should be avoided. Of course, manual baserunning can be tricky as well. Several times when I would hit the button to advance my runners, they would ignore me completely. Turns out that I had to hit the button three or four times before they did something, and by then it was often too late to turn that single into a double (the gamepad was in perfect working condition, by the way). <P>The game offers season, exhibition, and home run derby modes, but for some bizarre reason you still cannot choose to play a short or medium-length season: It\'s 162 games or nothing. A great player editor is included with the game, and it lets you edit, create, and trade players at will - but just like last year, it is not incorporated into the actual game. You have to launch it separately from the Windows start menu. <P>Microsoft Baseball 2000 exhibited a number of graphical bugs and glitches. For starters, the menu screens were flaky, with buttons and menu items appearing and disappearing from screen to screen. This happened with the latest drivers for a Riva TNT card, so the cause of the problem is still uncertain. Also, the game choked completely the first few times I tried to launch it in Voodoo2 SLI mode (1024x768). The game was actually going on, but all I saw was the ""Game loading"" screen, overlaid by the lineup that appears at the start of each game. This problem eventually went away on its own, but again, the cause is indeterminate. Finally, about halfway through a game between the Cubs and the White Sox, the game flipped out entirely and decided that it was now taking place between the White Sox and the White Sox. Both teams became the same, and the computer seized control of the action. It was pitching, it was hitting, and it was fielding, and I could not stop it without quitting the game entirely. That was a most disturbing bug. <P>Overall, this is still a decent game but not one that can compete well against High Heat Baseball 2000 or even Triple Play 2000. The graphics are excellent, and the batter/pitcher interface is equally impressive. Unfortunately, the rest of the game is rather disappointing. About the best thing Microsoft Baseball 2000 has going for it is the $19.99 price tag, which should help boost sales among uninformed buyers.<I>--Michael E.

There's animated game pieces with real personalities, 3-D graphics, and Internet play. Play Classic, Team, Strategy, or Way Sorry!"", 'Over the last few years, Hasbro Interactive has established a growing presence in the interactive entertainment business, taking many of its most popular board games of yesteryear and translating them to the PC CD-ROM platform. This astute if conservative strategy has paid off handsomely for the fledgling computer game publisher, capitalizing on its library of renowned board games to a huge, pre-installed base of consumers that fondly remember playing these classics. <P>In the case of Sorry! CD-ROM, Hasbro Interactive has not only crafted a faithful representation of this ageless board game, but in so doing has included an array of extraordinary features that breathe new life into a time-honored favorite. For the uninitiated, Sorry! is a simple yet enjoyable board game, in which you take turns hopping your four pawns along a single rectangular track, moving each pawn from its separate starting area to its home base. You take turns drawing cards from a special deck, moving your pawns in accordance with the card\'s instructions. Pawns can move forwards or backwards along the track, advancing several additional squares if they land at the start of a slide. Depending upon the card played, pawns may also trade places with an opposing player\'s pawns or perhaps land on them, sending them back to their starting location to repeat the process all over again. The object of the game is straightforward enough - be the first player to successfully move all four of your pawns into your home area. <P>From game setup through actual play, Sorry! CD-ROM employs a mouse-driven point-and-click interface that\'s both intuitive and simple to use. In addition, you can choose to view the board from either a catty-cornered 3D perspective or a more traditional head-on vantage point, and you may even rotate the board to have it face any desired direction. Once you decide which pawn you\'ll move and where you\'ll move it, a letter-boxed window momentarily replaces the game board, depicting, in rather whimsical fashion, where the pawn has relocated. Pawn movement is portrayed using a wide array of cute animations, ranging from steam-rolling flywheels to hoola-hooping buffoons. Moreover, all of the pawns, be they computer or human controlled, routinely utter short, amusing remarks, which hold your attention even if it isn\'t your turn to move. <P>Several different modes of play have been included, covering everything from the familiar, classical game of Sorry! to an entirely new variant called Way Sorry!. In Way Sorry!, several new cards are added to the deck, including the so-called ""Bully"" and ""Buddy"" cards. The Bully card lets your pawn switch places with an opponent\'s pawn, sending the opposing pawn back to start. On the other hand, the Buddy card lets you move your pawn adjacent to the nearest pawn, which can be located in either direction on the board. Furthermore, you can opt to play the game by yourself or with a teammate, or you may play the game in either classical or strategy mode. In classical mode, you take turns drawing and playing one card from the deck moving as many pawns as you dare onto the game board. In strategy mode, you start out with five cards, which are kept hidden from your opponents. When it\'s your turn, you may choose to play any card in your hand, which is then replaced by a new card at the conclusion of your turn. <P>As with Monopoly, Scrabble, Risk, and Battleship, Hasbro Interactive has successfully ported the venerable game of Sorry! to the computerized medium, reacquainting a legion of hard-core and casual gamers with an old, if sometimes forgotten, friend.<I>--Marc Dultz</I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Take advantage of his vast wisdom and learn inside moves that you won't find anywhere else."", 'There was a time a few years back when Mindscape\'s Chessmaster series actually had some competition, but about the only serious rival on the market nowadays is Sierra\'s Power Chess line. Even with its incredibly strong chess engine, though, Power Chess just can\'t match the incredible array of teaching tools found in the Chessmaster games. <P>So the decision as to which chess program to buy is a no-brainer, right? Actually, the answer is a definite maybe. Chessmaster 6000 is unquestionably the most feature-packed installment in this classic series, and chess fans deciding on their first chess program should rush right out and grab it. But if you already own Chessmaster 5500 or even Chessmaster 5000, you might want to consider whether you\'ve exhausted the features of those games before buying the new version. <P>And what are the new features? Mindscape has significantly expanded an already impressive chess tutorial, adding considerably more topics that progress in a logical and easy-to-follow order from general chess concepts through the first crucial moves in a game and on to endgame strategies. Better yet, all the tutorials now feature voice commentary, and while that might seem like a small addition, it truly goes a long way in helping you stay focused on each lesson. Josh Waitzkin, subject of the book and movie <i>Searching for Bobby Fischer</i>, is back again as the ""host"" of the program, and the number of his voice-annotated games has been boosted to 14. These are a real treat for beginning and intermediate players, and even advanced players can glean new perspectives from the comments of 21-year-old Waitzkin. <P>Another addition is the inclusion of nearly 100 ""personalities"" - computer-controlled players that range in skill level from sheer novices to grandmasters. There\'s also a gallery of world-famous grandmasters to compete against, as well as the Chessmaster program itself; if you can beat the Chessmaster, you probably don\'t have much need for this program except for storing and annotating your own games. <P>Of course, all the other powerful tools of the Chessmaster series are back in full force. There\'s the wonderful natural-language advice option, which analyzes your position and suggests the appropriate moves (and tells you why the moves are good); auto-annotate, which constructs a complete analysis of any game or position; an Opening Book with over 2200 opening lines; a database coach that identifies openings and shows how the game can progress from that point on; and much, much more. <P>But there is one small disappointment here, and while it was probably unavoidable on Mindscape\'s part, it still makes Chessmaster not quite as enjoyable as it has been in the past. Chessmaster Live, which was hosted for the last couple of years by Mindscape, provided a way for Chessmaster owners to log on directly to the Internet and challenge other Chessmaster owners. There was an option to play for free, as well as subscribe to The Chessmaster Network for $19.95 a year and take part in classes, tourneys, and ranked games, and best of all the interface was a breeze, and the network performed relatively well in terms of bandwidth and latency. <P>But with the release of Chessmaster 6000, Mindscape has moved Chessmaster Live onto Mplayer - and the results don\'t exactly have me jumping for joy. With Chessmaster 5500 and Chessmaster Live, you could be up and playing in a matter of minutes; going through Mplayer, you might spend a good five or six minutes just logging on and waiting for advertisements to be downloaded before you can actually get to a screen where you can find a game. <P>This happened three times in all, and by the time I finally got on Mplayer (which seems to be running slower than I ever remember it), I was cranky and bored - not exactly the mood you want to be in when starting a chess game. <P>To be fair, Mindscape probably had to take Chessmaster to Mplayer because it couldn\'t afford to keep the network going, even if everyone had ponied up and paid the $19.95 membership fee. And at least Mplayer and Mindscape have created a patch that makes it possible for Chessmaster 5500 players to compete online as well. But it\'s unfortunate that Chessmaster 6000 doesn\'t have support for any other type of multiplayer mode. <P>If that bothers you, you can always pick up Sierra\'s Power Chess and play on the World Opponent Network - but that means giving up all the wonderful features exclusive to Chessmaster 6000. In the end, I still have to say that the Chessmaster line is the only way to go if you\'re looking for a chess program - but I\'ll also take this chance to say that Mindscape should make the effort to provide some other type of multiplayer support for Chessmaster 6000 and all future Chessmaster games. It\'s the least they can do for the millions of customers who\'ve made it the bestselling chess program of all time, don\'t you think? <I>--Stephen Poole </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Tomb Raider 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Lara Croft set the world on fire in Tomb Raider as it easily became one of the biggest games of 96 providing 3D Adventuring like no other. Compliments of 3D Accelerators Tomb Raider 2 on the PC now surpasses the PlayStation version graphically in nearly every aspect providing of course you own a P133+ with 3D Accelerator. The game runs in a number of high resolutions with richly detailed textures and perfectly lighted environments. Animation is also a strong point and all human opponents move relatively realistically though unless you have a high-end machine the frame rate may drop slightly. This time around the game takes place through more modern environments including the Great Wall of China, the streets of Venice, Tibet, oilrigs and even a shipwreck laying at the bottom of the ocean. Your enemies also are mostly made up of humans who while providing a greater challenge due to smarter AI leaves the satisfying originals slaughtering of almost exotic animals absent. Tomb Raider II contains seventeen huge levels, the clever use of smart puzzles, plenty of exploration for the vivid adventurer, many brilliant environments that are just ready to burst at the seams with life and plenty of weaponry insuring frantic action.', 'It was only a year ago that Eidos Interactive released Tomb Raider, a game that had such innovative flare that it defined its publisher as a formidable force in the gaming industry. With its cavernous 3D environments and charismatic protagonist - a hip English jet-setter named Lara Croft - Tomb Raider pioneered new territory in gaming. But can Tomb Raider II, which seldom strays from the original formula, stand up to the new generation of action games on the shelf? Definitely. <P> Taking its cue from the previous game, Tomb Raider II sees Croft becoming embroiled in a brand new globe-trotting hunt for treasure. Again, levels are lushly appointed with colorful textures, taking you on a visual voyage from the waterways of Venice to eerie subterranean catacombs, this time in search of the Dagger of Xian, a relic that supposedly bestows great power upon its bearer. <P> Once again, plot has little bearing on the Tomb Raider experience. Most of Lara\'s activities still consist of finding a key to open a door to find another key, with a lot of puzzle solving in between. For example, in one level a switch is thrown and a door opens in another part of the level. When the door is finally reached, it\'s shut. Solution: Drive a speedboat up to the door as soon as the switch is thrown. There are also a host of ""timed"" traps, where Lara will find herself having to charge desperately through a labyrinth of encroaching spikes and collapsing floors when she least expects it. It\'s the process of finding the key, of getting to that particular door that just opened, that makes Tomb Raider II a truly engaging adventure. <P> Complaints about the original, such as the tedium of levels and Lara\'s sometimes erratic control, have definitely been addressed in the sequel. Basic moves such as running leaps and grabs are slightly easier to perform with the new and improved heroine. Most importantly, this helps the levels stay interesting. From the very beginning, each trap or physical obstacle poses an extreme challenge, forcing you to control Lara with the utmost adeptness. More often than not, getting Ms. Croft from one ledge to another requires that two or more specific moves are executed in series. Performing a Hail-Mary leap only to cling successfully to a far-away wall; figuring out how to execute that perfect double-gainer back flip to get around a seemingly impassable trap: These kind of activities become the most rewarding part of playing the game. <P> Apart from being larger, the levels in Tomb Raider II are also more geographically interesting. Lara is exaggeratedly dwarfed in her surroundings, scaling the enormous walls of a gangster hideout\'s vestibule during one adventure, swinging from balcony to balcony in a surrealistically proportioned opera house during another. When dropped into these extremely spacious environments, Lara becomes a sort of modern Alice in Wonderland with you ultimately acting as guide. Featuring 18 massive levels, it\'s probably safe to say that Tomb Raider II represents more of an adventure than Alice ever had. <P> Tomb Raider was all about looks, and Tomb Raider II continues that trend. When running the game with a 3Dfx card, it\'s often tempting to simply sit back and take in the view. Combining breathtaking landscapes, fluid, Disney-like character animation, and (most importantly) a nicely balanced procession of obstacles, traps, and puzzles, Tomb Raider II is an excellent continuation to the Lara Croft saga.<I>--Tim Soete</I> <P> --<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Army Men,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games']",{},"[""Mixing childhood imagination with real-world environments, 3DO's <i>Army Men</i> brings to life the plastic military units we played with as kids. It's tactical action like you've always imagined: Melt 'em, shoot 'em, and blow 'em up, just like you did back then. But be careful--this time they shoot back.<P> Take on the role of Sarge and command a unit to defend, attack, or follow. Call in air strikes and send in paratroopers, but make sure to get a good picture of the land with air reconnaissance first."", ""When 3DO stopped billing Army Men as a strategy game and began labeling it an action game, many gamers were frustrated that they wouldn't be able to relive their plastic childhood battles in a real-time strategy setting. But the final result is a compelling game, and its only major fault is that it doesn't play up the toy soldier bit as much as it should. <P>In Army Men, you are cast in the role of Sarge, an onscreen hero who is responsible for fulfilling a variety of mission objectives set down by Green Army headquarters. You move your character around huge maps, picking up, using, and discarding different types of weapons; scooping up medkits, air support markers, and other items; hopping into and out of vehicles; and coaxing any accompanying troops into battle. At varying intervals along the way, enemy troops, combat vehicles, and various types of fortifications are dispersed across the map, deployed to stop Sarge from accomplishing his mission. When battle is joined, Sarge can fire his weaponry from either a standing, kneeling, or prone position and can evade enemy fire by diving or rolling to either side. Since Sarge can carry only three types of weapons and gear at a time, the trick is knowing when to drop certain articles in favor of more suitable items. <P>Interestingly, there are no independent scenarios included in the game. Instead, Army Men features a grand campaign game, which is segmented into three sequentially playable mini-campaigns. You begin the game in a desertlike region, eventually move on to an alpine setting, then finish your tour of duty in bayou country. Each mini-campaign is further subdivided into four scenarios, which, in turn, are composed of two to three interrelated missions played out across huge battle maps. In the process, you are slowly brought up to speed regarding the progress of the war with the evil Tan Army, which at times may be further augmented by units from the supposedly neutral Blue and Grey Armies. <P>Army Men also comes equipped with an informal boot camp, whereby you receive rudimentary training on the game interface, on how to use each type of weapon, and on how to issue orders to different combat units. You meander through a stylized shooting range, learning how to control your character, identify weapons caches, shoot rifles and bazookas, toss grenades, fire mortars, and handle flamethrowers. You are also taught how to lay mines, detect and unearth enemy minefields, plant explosives, call in air strikes and photo reconnaissance missions, drop paratroopers, and lead squads of loyal plastic soldiers into battle. In addition, you learn how to operate several different types of WWII-era combat vehicles, spanning everything from a jeep and a 2 1/2-ton truck to a half-track and a tank. Apart from the truck, each vehicle is outfitted with a rotating turret, which can train and fire its weapon across a 360-degree arc regardless of which direction the vehicle is moving. <P>Missions run the gamut, from simple reconnaissance operations to full-blown search-and-destroy operations involving multiple squads, several combat vehicles, and even air support. The typical mission brief usually entails moving Sarge from one map sector to another, sometimes requiring him to conduct special tasks along the way. Fortunately, it's always up to you to determine Sarge's route, what types of weapons he'll carry, discard, or use, when and where he'll confront the enemy, how he'll disperse any accompanying units, and how he'll employ any and all supporting arms. More importantly, gameplay is far from linear. Objectives can usually be reached using multiple avenues of approach, a variety of weaponry, and a wide array of battle tactics. For instance, instead of going toe-to-toe with an enemy tank and perhaps risking Sarge in an all-or-nothing engagement, you can try to lure the onrushing tank into a hastily sewn minefield. Alternatively, Sarge could be ordered to blow up a crucial bridge thereby preventing the tank from interfering with the mission at hand. Similarly, Sarge could order in air support, hop in another combat vehicle, or send in troops to destroy the tank while he watches from a safe vantage point. As a result, you are not bound by any predetermined set of rules and instead may fulfill the mission objectives any way you deem necessary.  <P>Army Men's combat animations are first-rate. Destroyed combat vehicles are flipped over or smashed into little pieces, a broken axle flimsily lying alongside the smoldering wreck as if to say these are still nothing more than glorified war toys. Explosions too are well handled with vibrant spouts of flame and choking debris showering the battlefield. The sound effects are equally superb, typically depicting men screaming in agony as they're continually burned, bombed, run over, or blown to smithereens. About the only thing missing is the flat stand-up bases, which have come to epitomize the weak-kneed plastic soldiers.  Despite its charm, Army Men nevertheless manages to shoot itself in the foot on several counts. For starters, you are unable to save a mission in progress and must either complete the mission or repeat it from the very beginning. Now, considering the time and effort it takes to move your forces from one end of the map to the other and the number of pitched battles you must fight along the way, I can't for the life of me understand why a save-game option wasn't made available. Secondly, combat vehicles can easily be put out of action long before they engage the enemy, oftentimes becoming immobilized if they inadvertently ram a tree or get hung up on a few rocks. Even if they're meant to portray plastic combat vehicles, the system could have been better tweaked to allow for an occasional mishap. Lastly, Army Men's replay value is extremely limited. For all intents and purposes, once you've conquered the immense campaign game, your military career has come to a screeching halt. While the inclusion of a multiplayer option is indeed commendable, no provision was made to let you create your own scenarios much less swap them with your friends. <P>While the plastic soldier theme might have been better served if it had played up the Toy Story angle a bit more, the end result is fun nonetheless. Army Men successfully melds the old with the new, taking an ageless pastime and literally, as well as figuratively, giving it new hi-tech legs.  <I>--Marc Dultz </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Heretic 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['This game is the newest title in the best-selling <I>Heretic-Hexen</I> series. A third-person action game based on the <I>Quake 2</I> engine, <I>Heretic 2</I> sets players on a quest through vast city and outdoor environments as they search for a cure to a deadly evil plague before all is lost. Using the Quake 2 engine, <I>Heretic 2</I> plunges you into a deep, compelling game that combines brutal face-to-face combat and mystery-laden adventure in the most advanced graphics engine yet. From a third-person perspective, gamers travel through complex, richly detailed environments filled with stunning special effects, wicked magic spells, detailed characters, vivid artwork, and challenging-level designs created by the Raven team and renowned fantasy artist Brom.', 'Didn\'t seem like a good idea when Raven Software announced it was working on Heretic II. After all, Heretic, the original Doom clone, spawned the Doom engine-based sequel Hexen, which gave rise to the Quake engine-based Hexen II. So when the Raven team decided to pull a fast one and create a ""true"" sequel to the original Heretic based on the Quake II engine, it seemed like they were just being cute. But it turns out Raven was dead serious, as not only is Heretic II a satisfying departure from the lukewarmly received Hexen series, but it\'s a bold step away from the genre\'s traditional first-person confinement. Heretic II, which plays from a behind-the-back third-person perspective, still controls a lot like a first-person shooter, but it\'s different enough to look and feel not just like a great new shooter, but like a great new kind of game. You wouldn\'t want to live there, but the world of Heretic II is a beautiful place to visit. Sure, the game is based on the Quake II engine, but you\'d never guess from looking at it since it looks just that much better. Gone are the claustrophobic corridors of id\'s shooter. Instead you get expansive, meticulously detailed, and tastefully colored architecture that is amazing to behold more often than not. Even those sorts of places that are traditionally ugly and drab, like swamps and dusty old temples, look absolutely stunning in Heretic II, with fog and lighting effects subtly implemented to make such places look both real and fantastic. All the environments look different, from room to room, and especially from level to level. A host of appropriately dressed, appropriately sinister monsters populate each region, and all of them look great even if some look a little puny. Best of all, they die in spectacular gouts of blood and gore, and you can even dismember the humanoid ones with your sword staff. The violence is accented by appropriate if somewhat subdued and nondescript sound effects and a correspondingly meek and understated musical score. <P>Since the soft-spoken elf hero Corvus is in the spotlight at all times, he\'s made to look especially detailed. He walks, runs, sneaks, sidesteps, crawls, rolls, flips, climbs, and swims much as you\'d expect from an elf of his stature, but he\'s at his most impressive when he\'s fighting. The mainstay in Corvus\' arsenal is his sword staff, which he\'ll power up to stunning potency over the course of his quest. He has several slick moves with this weapon and can even pole-vault with it to make those especially difficult jumps. The brunt of his ranged weapons are magic spells, including fire- and lightning-based attacks, and worse. All of these look dazzling as they light up the screen, and if anything, they\'re not quite as devastating in effect as they are in appearance. Corvus has other tricks up his sleeve: a Hellstaff, which fires energy bolts at a furious rate; the Storm Bow, whose magical red arrows create deadly thunder showers; and the Phoenix Bow, whose ammunition explodes in the image of its fiery namesake. All of these can be powered up temporarily by means of the Tome of Power, which makes the attacks even more spectacular to behold, and all the deadlier in practice. <P>While it was a single-use power-up in previous Heretic games, the Tome is now a persistent item (not to mention a character in the story) that requires defensive mana for its effects, which also fuels several useful defensive spells. From the meteor shield, whose shimmering green boulders wait in orbit and lash out at your enemies, to the fearsome morph ovum that turns your enemies into henpecked shells of their former selves, the defensive spells are as impressive as the main arsenal. Using offensive and defensive abilities in proper conjunction all while dodging enemy attacks is the key to Heretic II, and although it\'s a similar enough feel to your typical first-person shooter, it\'s hardly the same. Certainly the third-person perspective gives you a better sense of dodging enemy attacks, but the camera, which only rarely obstructs your view, does in fact inhibit some of your peripheral vision and makes it difficult to detect enemies attacking from the flanks. Corvus has a lot of moves in his repertoire, and most of them are useful, but altogether he moves a little sluggishly compared with your typical first-person action hero, especially while sidestepping. Still, he could run circles around Lara Croft any day, and a simple, even amusing tutorial will help you get acquainted with how he operates in no time. <P>Heretic II fixes most every shortcoming the series ever had, in large part by returning to the Heretic formula rather than following the Hexen tradition. Although Hexen and its sequel each offered three character classes to choose from, the same resources could have gone into making a single, far more interesting protagonist. That\'s what Raven did with Heretic II, whose hero packs so much firepower that you won\'t soon find yourself getting bored using the same old magic tricks. Better yet, the levels are finely paced, with ammunition and mana in rather short supply such that you\'ll have to be conservative with your attacks, even as new weapons, spells, and power-ups are introduced with perfect timing. The levels are large, cohesive, and intuitively structured, and you even get nicely acted in-game cutscenes during and between them. You can travel back and forth between certain areas in a throwback to the Hexen and Quake II hub system, but much like those other games, the hub system doesn\'t work all that well. It\'s just not much fun to have to backtrack, even if you do face new enemies on the way back, but it is a convenient means of increasing the length of the game. Searching for keys to locked doors or pushing three buttons in sequence isn\'t much fun either, and you\'ll be forced to do such petty tasks occasionally, but never in excess. <P>If there\'s any real fault to Heretic II, it\'s in the name - this game is in a league above its predecessors, and although it continues the original\'s plot and holds over many of its weapons and items, it mustn\'t be regarded with the kind of prejudice its predecessors might evoke. Otherwise, sure, the game suffers from a bug or two, level load times aren\'t insubstantial, the third-person perspective thing isn\'t exactly revolutionary, and altogether the game isn\'t very long (although it\'s worth replaying cooperatively). Occasional areas in Heretic II can be frustrating either because they\'re difficult or because they\'re confusing, and as a deathmatch game, it isn\'t as fast and furious as Quake. But one look at the game, one taste of any of the weapons it places at your disposal, and you\'ll forget all about the little things like that. <I>--Greg Kasavin </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Total Air War - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<i>Total Air War</i> is designed as the ultimate strategic simulation of modern air combat. You're not just flying the plane, you're commanding the war. <i>Total Air War</i> features 10 open-ended scenarios, each increasing in intensity. Novices can involve themselves in short, intense conflicts such as small border disputes, while diehard gamers can try to master a full-scale war among coalition forces. The campaign will alter depending on the actions and reactions of the user. Minor altercations can escalate rapidly, leading to the intervention of the superpowers and total war."", 'With most games, a handful of annoying bugs and intermittent crash problems are enough to negate whatever potential fun factor there might have been. With DID\'s Total Air War, on the other hand, the gameplay is so good and the overall game design so solid that it\'s pretty easy to overlook its flaws. This is, quite simply, one of the most addictive, entertaining, and approachable jet combat sims I\'ve ever seen. <P>Total Air War is the sequel to F-22 Air Dominance Fighter, and it improves upon its predecessor in numerous ways. The most notable new feature is Total Air War\'s comprehensive campaign mode, which lets you take part in ten fully dynamic conflicts in the Red Sea region. In each campaign, the AI will plot out a general strategy while you take part in combat and AWACS missions to further the overall war aims. <P>While you don\'t exercise much direct control over campaign strategy, the eventual outcome is highly dependent on your performance in combat, AWACS, and scramble missions. As the campaign unfolds in real time, the AI maintains a running list of available combat missions. You begin each campaign as a novice pilot, and, since combat missions are ranked according to difficulty and importance, you can only access the easiest escort and CAP assignments. As you gain experience and rank, however, you\'ll be able to take on deep-strike assignments and more dangerous escort missions. One of Total Air War\'s most notable features, the mission planner, lets you customize every aspect of a given mission. Using this planner, you can modify the waypoints, weapons loadouts, and even the number and type of escort flights for every mission available to you. Of course, since the campaign chugs along in real time, you can\'t take too long to plan your missions - if you do, the AI will handle them itself, and they\'ll disappear from the list. <P>In addition to the combat missions, you can also take control of an AWACS patrol at almost any time during a campaign (provided that you still have some AWACS aircraft left in your arsenal). From these patrols, you will have a bird\'s-eye view of the air campaign and will be able to direct allied aircraft to intercept enemy forces or patrol specific areas. Periodically, you will also receive requests to vector inbound friendly aircraft to tankers or alternate airfields. Best of all, you can jump from the AWACS into the cockpit of any F-22 in the theater at any time. So long as your E-3 doesn\'t get shot down, you can continue to jump from F-22 to F-22 until the end of your patrol. If you\'d rather just observe from afar, you can track any object on the map (air and ground targets alike) through the mini-camera view on the AWACS interface. <P>The last type of mission in Total Air War is the scramble. If you volunteer for scramble missions, you will be prompted whenever an intercept flight of F-22s goes on alert at an allied airbase. If you accept the mission, you will find yourself in the cockpit of an F-22 on the runway, ready for takeoff. These missions are generally brief and nasty, as scrambles usually don\'t occur until the bad guys are within AMRAAM range. Scrambles are, however, one of the best ways to move up the ranks so that you can access the tougher combat missions. <P>Because of the dynamic campaign engine, no two missions are ever exactly the same (though several are very, very similar). As a result, Total Air War offers nearly limitless replayability. Also, since each campaign runs in real time and not as a series of predefined scenarios, you can fly a mind-boggling number of missions in each campaign. For example, I had already taken part in 70 sorties - including combat, AWACS, and scramble hops - before my first campaign was even half over. The sheer number of missions available makes it ideal for flight sim buffs who are tired of the same old scripted scenarios. <P>Part of Total Air War\'s appeal, however, is the fact that you don\'t have to be a hard-core sim fan to appreciate the game. At its core, Total Air War is a sophisticated and realistic combat sim with solid flight modeling and challenging enemy AI. But thanks to the various difficulty settings and a versatile autopilot mode, novice pilots should be able to enjoy this game as well. <P>Of course, novice and veterans alike will have to watch out for a handful of annoying bugs. The autopilot is particularly irksome. In addition to occasionally slamming my F-22 into a mountain during automated landings (which I can optimistically chalk up to the realistic modeling of computer reliability and MTBF) the Total Air War autopilot sometimes fails to engage at all during takeoffs. While many sim pilots will scoff at the idea of autopilot-assisted takeoffs, there are times in Total Air War when they almost appear to be necessary. For example, even if you manually taxi out to the runway and await proper clearance at the proper time, your wingmen and escort flights will not always take off with you. This can be troublesome on deep-strike missions when you find yourself alone with a gazillion SAM radars smiling up at you. Fortunately, you can usually get around this problem by using the game\'s time-skip feature to move quickly from mission start to an airborne position en route to your target. <P>Additionally, the game\'s ""target view"" feature during mission briefings is often inadequate. While I\'m sure the developers were trying to simulate the quality of data available in a real wartime situation, the images of target buildings were sometimes useless. The camera was usually zoomed out too far and moving too fast to provide an accurate idea of the building\'s size and shape. Though you can typically get an idea of its location, this information is nearly meaningless when you arrive over a target and have to pick out one building from the dozens below. <P>One of the biggest problems with Total Air War, however, is the fact that you are severely penalized for ejecting - even after successfully completing a mission. While I agree that a pilot should not receive full mission credit if he doesn\'t bring his ship back to base, I also recognize that making it to the ground alive is pretty damn important. DID should really modify this aspect of the game, perhaps giving only partial credit for bailouts, and then only when they occur over friendly territory. <P>Finally, I encountered an intermittent crash bug that was quite infuriating. Several times, often after I had successfully completed a particularly difficult mission and landed, the game would crash out to Windows 95 for no apparent reason. <P>Still, Total Air War is such a solid game that these flaws seem almost forgivable. I anxiously await a patch that fixes some of the obvious bugs and hope that DID will in some way address some of the game\'s other minor flaws. In the meantime, I will continue to play Total Air War, logging countless hours in the skies over the Red Sea region and enjoying a truly enjoyable and unique jet combat sim. <I>--Michael E.

A-10 Cuba - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Famous for its rugged design, unique looks, and 30-millimeter cannon, the A-10 is one serious piece of aerial machinery. <i>A-10 Cuba</i> lets players slip into the titanium cockpit of this close air-support plane and dish out some serious hurt in a fictional campaign against Cuba.', ""It is unfortunate that <i>A-10 Cuba</i>'s graphics are so dated, because the physics and flight models are some of the most convincing we've ever tested. Few other flight simulations do such a great job of conveying the feeling of commanding an aircraft, whether it is the landing gear struts compressing when we braking on the runway or the plane's crazy behavior when damaged. The attention to detail in the cockpit also deserves praise, as nearly every button, knob, display, and handle is rendered as an interactive object. It takes a lot of practice to get familiar with its complexities, but the reward is in knowing you are handling one of the most realistic re-creations of a military aircraft ever crafted."", 'Ultimately, the worst thing about <i>A-10 Cuba</i> is the lack of missions. The designers gave us this great aircraft to fly and then didn\'t give us enough to do with it. The ""campaign"" is just a series of linked missions without much of an overarching story line to hold them together. The skies are alive with other aircraft, but they never talk to one another. Much like the aircraft it simulates, <i>A-10 Cuba</i> is all business, and players who want a flight simulator with personality should look elsewhere. <i>--T. Byrl Baker</i>', '<b>Pros:</b>', '', ""It's one thing to create an ultra-realistic flight simulation, but it's quite another to design it so that novice to intermediate pilots won't feel intimidated. And while it's great for a sim to be as realistic as possible - it would be slammed by every serious flight sim fanatic in the world if it weren't - that doesn't mean there's no place for options that allow newbies to fine-tune the degree of realism, or for a well-organized manual to help them understand the myriad weapons, gauges, and controls on a modern attack jet. And for it to qualify as a first-rate product, it also needs features such as a mission editor, wingmen you can communicate with, and a campaign mode, to name a few."", 'A-10 Cuba!, which bills itself as both an ""ultra-realistic flight simulation"" and ""the most realistic flight combat simulator ever,"" is a perfect example of what I\'m talking about. Without question, A-10 Cuba! employs a very realistic flight model, and the air-combat action - which ranges from tank-killing sorties and escort missions to a bridge-busting assignment and a strike on an enemy commander\'s home - is fast, furious, and very satisfying.', ""The cockpit display is one of the most impressively detailed I've ever seen, and what's more, it is actually interactive: You can toggle switches and turn knobs via the mouse. And while gamers accustomed to texture-mapped extravaganzas might sneer at the polygon-based graphics here, they do make for a stunningly impressive frame rate - even running at 1024x768 - and the planes look pretty good, especially from an external view."", ""But in several crucial areas, A-10 Cuba! falls short of the competition. Its most glaring deficiency is the lack of a printed manual; the only documents you get with this game are the registration card, a layout of the keyboard commands, an order form for ThrustMaster flight sticks, and an almost worthless jewel-case insert that's woefully thin on useful information. The latter contains a screenshot with captions describing various cockpit flight instruments, but the picture and text are both so small you'd need a magnifying glass to get any real use out of it."", 'To be fair, A-10 Cuba! does come with online Help, but there\'s just too much information here to be covered adequately in this format - and if you stay in the Help file too long while the game is running, you\'ll be kicked out by a demo that you can\'t disable. This simply doesn\'t cut it for a flight sim, especially one that boasts how ""ultra-realistic"" it is. Novice and even intermediate flight-sim fans need a manual they can keep at their side for quick reference, and novices especially would benefit from a ""basics of flight"" type tutorial - the kind that\'s found in the manual of many PC air-combat sims.', ""Other common features are missing, too. There's no specific support for popular four-button flight sticks such as the CH FlightStick Pro or the Microsoft SideWinder 3D Pro - or if there is I couldn't find it in the Help file. (Then again, the numerous keyboard commands almost dictate using some type of programmable stick or throttle.) While the 12 combat missions are varied and exciting, and the game's AI routines for enemy forces guarantee that no single mission will pan out the same way twice, that doesn't change the fact that there are only 12 missions - a pretty sparse amount for a flight sim. The situation is made even worse by the lack of a mission editor."", 'There\'s no way to communicate with wingmen; no way to change your waypoints; no campaign mode (except to play the 12 combat missions in order); no way to access a mission briefing during a sortie; no ""auto-navigate"" feature to guide you to a waypoint; no toggle for stalls; no variable difficulty modes; and no option to skip take-off and start in the air (though many targets are so close by you might want to take off just to make the experience last longer).', ""It's true that A-10 Cuba! carries a very low sticker price - and if you trade in a copy of A-10 Tank Killer, Silent Thunder: A-10 Tank Killer II, ATF, AH64 LongBow, F-22 Lightning, SU-27, or EF2000, Activision will send you a check for $15, which means you could get this game for as little as $14 or $15. Considering the fun to be had dogfighting over a LAN or modem, that really boosts the value rating."", ""Longtime flight-sim fans will take to the realism of A-10 Cuba! like ducks to water, and forgive it its shortcomings - easy to do with a sim offering such an authentic flight model and intense combat missions. But if you're relatively new to the genre, you might want to try a sim that allows graduated levels of realism and more features, and includes a printed manual.<i>--Stephen Poole</i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Flight Unlimited 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Depart your local airport and cruise to the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the world's most popular flying venues, to one of 46 different airports. Fly over realistic scenery complete with the actual landmarks, buildings, and roadways you'd need to navigate visually. Or use your instruments to safely navigate in poor visibility and foul weather. Experience adventures and challenges, some of which let you fly in the face of the Federal Aviation Administration."", 'Flight Unlimited is a tough act to follow. A detailed physical model, lavish graphics, and a selection of high-performance planes set a new standard for aviation sims. After most of the original team responsible for FU departed, Looking Glass needed to start over and reconceive its product line. It did this by moving away from the aerobatic emphasis of the original FU in order to create a thorough and exacting simulation of civil aviation in one region, with results that are as impressive as they are innovative. <P>Unlike the thousands of international airports offered by MS Flight Sim (the other major civil-aviation sim), Flight Unlimited II concentrates on 46major airports (and many minor ones) within the confined area of the San Francisco Bay area. This decision cuts two ways. Microsoft Flight Sim folk will undoubtedly be disappointed to find only one region mapped, since they are used to cross-country jaunts. But by narrowing the range, Looking Glass has been able to re-create its little spot of terra firma in exacting detail. <P>Graphically, it is probably one of the most complex representations of a single region available in any sim. With its 3D-accelerated graphics, terrain and objects flow smoothly on even the higher resolutions, though things do begin to bog down once you go much over 800x600. Software acceleration is also available, providing a good show even without the hardware. The result of all this detail is to provide the pilot with true visual flight rules and terrain following. Navigation with the Mark 1 eyeball is rarely this well implemented. A full complement of locations (Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz) and beautiful scenery makes it all the more enjoyable. <P>Graphics are only one part of the equation that creates the quite realistic feeling of FU II. Looking Glass has spent a great deal of time perfecting the physics, the instrumentation, and, most importantly, the traffic and tower AI. Instead of the high-performance stunt planes of the original, FU II models some staples of civilian flight: the Beechcraft Baron twin-engine, Piper Arrow single, de Havilland Beaver float plane, P51-D Mustang, and the ""Trainer 172"" (which looks like a Cessna to me). The performance and handling are top-notch across the board, right down to the weather effects and the unique handling of the Beaver during water takeoffs and landings. These are tight, effective flight models that truly capture the feel of these planes, two of which I\'ve actually flown. Each has a full complement of instruments for true cross-country instrument flying, unlike the simpler cockpits of the original FU. <P>Adding to the sense of realism is a complex re-creation of air traffic, radio messages, and tower controls. Flight II is as much a radio and air-traffic sim as it is a flight sim, with detailed, smoothly edited cockpit chatter. Dealing with the ATCs at various airports adds greatly to the feeling of airspace restrictions, takeoff, landing, and other aspects of flight control. There are also allegedly some provisions made for restricted military airspace, but no matter how many times I buzzed Travis, I couldn\'t stir the hornets out of their nests. <P>Gameplay is pretty open-ended, as one would expect from a pure sim. You can set up flight plans and save them, then fly point-to-point. A couple dozen special missions are also included, and they run the gamut from dropping chickens on Candlestick Park to breaking some prisoners out of Alcatraz. Creating a custom flight in any condition and at any location is very simple with the planner, and the variety of weather conditions (with the best weather effects in any sim, bar none) can make for some harrowing flights. The interface that ties all this together is easy and intuitive. <P>There were some problems with the initial release that have been largely hammered out and some that are due to be. Tower AI goes daffy now and then, and the aforementioned lack of a proper response in restricted airspace comes to mind. A problem with the center trim on the elevator has been fixed (this was very annoying). The Mustang has several bugs in it that have been mostly fixed. Control and joystick routines are overall pretty clean, and while there were some instances of graphical glitches, there were no hard crashes. <P>Flight Unlimited II is a very different experience from the original. For fans of civil aviation, it offers a whole new way to look at flight without the fight. It doesn\'t have the globe-spanning sweep of Microsoft Flight Simulator, but it renders its own little corner of the world with admirable fidelity. <I>--T.

Combining the ruthless combat of its predecessor with strategic asset management, <I>Mercenaries</I> engulfs players in full-scale, megaton warfare while giving them control over an entire freelance war-making operation, including finances, personnel, contract negotiation, and equipment management. Players battle as guns-for-hire within the Inner Sphere, a world where alliances, rivalries, and honor count for nothing in the face of big-money contracts to kill.', ""First off, if you're one of the many people who've been writing in asking for our opinion of MechWarrior Mercenaries, let me end the suspense right away. It's all you've been waiting for and more. Activision's new sim takes everything that was entertaining about MechWarrior 2 and combines it with fantastic resource management features to create a hybrid that is unmatched in the futuristic sims category. <P> With that said, let's give the newbies a chance to catch up. MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries is a prequel to Activision's popular MechWarrior 2. As the leader of a crack squad of mercenaries in the year 3039, you must accept enough important missions, collect enough cash, and avoid enough political BS to keep your team fitted with the giant living robots they rely on to survive. These 'mechs (short for BattleMechs) are upright Leviathans with more firepower than a fleet of today's tanks, and are used to wage war on many different worlds in the space that you call home. While most mercenaries will tell you that the only thing that matters is who brings home the paycheck, the wise commander will also keep abreast of the overall status of this conflict, making sure never to back a loser for too long, or to back a winner who threatens to bring an unprofitable future to your squad. <P> Although the folks at FASA (the creators of the MechWarrior pen-and-paper roleplaying games) worked hard to put together several strong plots, it's the gameplay in MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries that is so completely addictive. On the sim side, the game has everything that made MechWarrior 2 such a hit. Smooth graphics and animations mix with an intuitive control system (although it's not as easy to learn as it could be) that lets players get the feel for battle firsthand. On top of that, players are required to keep track of new factors like salvage - if you're tricky (in other words, if you don't shoot everything you see into small pieces) you can even get ahold of some Clan mechs - and repair costs that add an entirely new spin to an already challenging game. Worry not, action lovers - a new instant action option lets you bypass all of the new intellectual requirements and jump right into battle at the helm of over 30 classic era 'mechs. <P> MechWarrior: Mercenaries artistic vision is brilliant, but sometimes its execution leaves a little to be desired, considering the advances made in graphics during the year since MW2's release. The entire game is rendered in well-mapped polygons that will give a player with a little imagination a good feel of what it might be like to be on a futuristic battleground in snow, on rock, by day or night. Thanks to cool visual effects like the Thermal Sensors and an amazing particle physics system, laser blasts and missile trails really add to the overall realism of the product. MechWarrior's audio is another split story, combining solid voice acting and sound effects with a soundtrack that doesn't hold up too well through the long listening sessions involved in the average game. <P> In the end, there's an awful lot to like about MechWarrior: Mercenaries, and those who liked the first two games are in for a real treat when they open the shrink wrap on this follow-up. All new AI, an amazing network play system that allows players to host their own multiplayer games over the Internet, and some really great pre-made missions ensure that the game is almost certain to appeal to any fan of action or simulation games. <I>--Trent C.

East Front 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>East Front 2</i> is a stand-alone game that combines all the scenarios, campaigns, units and nationalities found in <i>East Front</i> and <i>Campaign</i>, while adding the new gaming features and improvements of <i>West Front</i>. It is tactical combat on the Eastern Front at its most complete and very finest. Besides compiling the features of the previous games, <i>East Front 2</i> also gives over 45 all-new scenarios, two new Dynamic Campaign Games, and two Linked Campaign Games, battles that can be found only in this release.', 'Ignore the fact that there\'s a Roman numeral in the title. East Front II is not a sequel, but rather a ""gold"" edition. Basically it\'s all the original East Front scenarios, the campaign disc, and 50 new scenarios upgraded with the advances found in West Front. Yes, that\'s right, Talonsoft has gone the Sierra route and rereleased a game that originally suffered from severe bug infestation. Yet even Sierra would at least have included a rebate if you already owned the original game, something you won\'t find in East Front II\'s box. Instead, as a concession, you can order East Front II through Talonsoft at a discounted price, but tough luck if you\'ve already picked it up at a retailer - you\'re stuck with full price. <P> So what\'s new in East Front II? Well, imagine all the improvements of West Front, applied to the original East Front. This means better graphics such as contoured terrain features and vehicle camouflage schemes, several optional rules such as armor facing, a linked campaign mode, and a thick manual. Of course, everything you didn\'t like about West Front is still present, such as the annoying supply rules (supply in a game where most scenarios represent an hour of real time? Come on, at least make the rules optional!). And oh yes, don\'t forget that 50 new scenarios have been added. While veterans of the original East Front might have to take a long hard look into their wallets, picking up East Front II is a no-brainer for green recruits. <P> If you\'re a newcomer to the world of computer wargaming, but grew up on board games, East Front II plays a lot like Avalon Hill\'s Panzer Blitz or GDW\'s Blood and Thunder. Turns represent six minutes, with most scenarios lasting from one hour to two hours of simulated time. A single unit represents a platoon, with individual strength points equaling half an infantry squad, a full MG team, an artillery piece, or a tank. The game is played out on a hex grid (each hex is 250 meters) and conforms to the standard ""side A moves and fights, then side B does the same"" style of play. Victory levels are derived from the control of certain hexes and the destruction of enemy forces while preserving friendly forces. <P> Because East Front II is a computer game, technology eases some of the burdens found in board wargaming. For example, true fog of war is possible without any convoluted double-blind system. The pain of setting up hundreds of cardboard counters is eliminated, as is trying to recall dozens of arcane rules and tables. The game is very user friendly, with plenty of online help, but most importantly the control scheme is very intuitive. The basics can be mastered in a few minutes, and the manual (weighing in at a nice 239 pages, and it even includes an index) does a good job of laying out all the tables one could want. <P> The graphics are pleasing to the eye, with a choice of three 3D views and two 2D views. In the 3D view the maps are laid out in an oblique manner, with terrain resembling that found in a diorama and units looking like hand-painted die-cast miniatures. The only downside is the poor sense of scale; tanks are as big as buildings, and the soldiers are all descendants of Paul Bunyon. The 2D view portrays the more traditional view found in board games, looking directly down on the terrain with units represented by icons. Unlike The Operational Art of War, the 3D view is actually playable and doesn\'t detract from the player\'s battlefield awareness. <P> One of the most impressive features of East Front II is simply the sheer size of the game. There are 150 single scenarios, a random scenario generator, an editor for crafting your own scenarios, and several campaign games. The dynamic campaign mode of the original is still present, but a linked campaign mode has been added. In the linked mode, the scenarios follow a ""tree,"" with the number of scenarios you branch into depending entirely on how well you fare. If none of that is enough, there\'s also the slew of multiplayer options to extend gameplay, including the ability of 16 players to play over the Internet in one scenario! Imagine trying to get that many gamers together around your kitchen table! <P> While there\'s something to be said for gaming against organic intelligence, another advantage of computer wargaming is simply the ability to provide an opponent for you. Many wargames make up for the lack of a decent AI by creating scenarios that are actually puzzles. In these puzzle scenarios, good tactics are always overshadowed by trying to figure out the proper use of your units in the situation. East Front II\'s artificial intelligence puts up a good fight, and because of that, the scenarios are winnable by good strategy, not following a walk-through guide. <P> The biggest problem comes from the aforementioned supply rules that are totally out of place in a tactical game. Considering the background most of the scenario designers have with board wargaming, it seems strange that they allowed the supply rules to remain in the game. Some other problems include the inability to cancel an artillery attack and the console style of saving in a campaign. You can only save after a campaign scenario and never during the scenario. The rationale is to prevent ""cheating"" by retrying a scenario until you get the best score. Not everyone who wants to save during a campaign scenario is interested in cheating though; sometimes we just don\'t have enough time to sit down for an entire session. <P> East Front II is everything the original East Front should have been when it was released. It\'s big, engrossing, enjoyable, and true to its board game roots. It\'s just a shame that Talonsoft would make it appear like it was a true sequel, and not including a rebate is just as shameful. Still, East Front II is the best tactical level wargame to come out in a long time. If you have the original game and the expansion CD, you\'ll have to decide if the new features are really worth the money (and also take two points off the value score). For the rest of the world, dress warmly and expect to spend quite some time in those harsh Russian winters.<i>--Scott R. Krol</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Need for Speed: V-Rally 2,,['Playstation Game'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Need For Speed: V-Rally is the latest Electronic Arts entry into the racing world. However, don't be fooled by the title. This game has nothing in common with the previous NFS games, and wasn't even programmed by the same team. EA simply picked up the rights to V-Rally, brought it over from Europe, and slapped the NFS name on it.. EA also ported over all 42 tracks and 11 cars as well, an impressive lineup compared to most racing games. This is one of V-Rally's biggest draws, because even though there are so many tracks, they don't suffer from weak layout or boring level design. Each track has its own look, and there are plenty of conditions (dirt, asphalt, snow, rain) to race in. Rally fans take note, the car lineup is a nice collection of rally cars, including the Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer, and various other name brand cars. V-Rally has some of the nicest-looking graphics around, with smooth backgrounds and colorful scenery. The tracks are pleasing to the eye. The cars themselves look good as well, although not as detailed as the tracks. The sound effects are average, nothing great but at least the engine sound lacks that annoying whine that can plague racing games. The music is fairly good, composed of the typical rock-type music found in racing games, with a few tracks slightly above par. The biggest draw to V-Rally is the graphics and the huge number of tracks. However, looks and tracks alone don't make a game. And this is where V-Rally falters. The control, to put it bluntly, is horrible. The cars spin out much, much too easily, and even with understeering turned all the way up in the options, the cars still tend to go wild. Granted, some cars do turn better than others (the bigger cars tend to flip uncontrollably at the slightest touch or bump), but even the best-handling cars suffer from bad control design. All in all, V-Rally could have been one of the best driving games ever, but because of its shoddy control, it simply becomes a great-looking game that isn't worth playing.

And with an Internet link, there's always an Outburst party for you to burst into. (Ages 17 and older)"", 'There have been few attempts to turn party word games into PC games, and probably for good reason. The games that currently exist such as Scrabble and Boggle do fine because there is a material component (a board or dice with letters) that acts as a visual cue to the gameplay. But when you try to dress up a word game like Outburst, which only uses cards with witty comments and a ""quirky"" host, you\'re bound to run into some stumbling blocks. <P>Outburst is a verbal party game where players divide into teams and try to guess phrases/words for a particular topic. For example, if the subject is ""Robert Redford films,"" answers like The Sting and The Natural are valid. However, the answers are preselected so that points are only gained for guessing the answers chosen by the game\'s creators. The game progresses through the various subjects, and each team tries to get more right answers than the other. <P>The trick to making computer versions of board games or party games work is the additional effort you put into the product. With Outburst, Hasbro added some extra flash to the game, but it\'s such a rip-off of the great You Don\'t Know Jack series that half the time you\'ll be thinking the game was made by Berkeley Systems. The announcer has that quirky tone. There are fake commercials between categories that offer outlandish and sometimes disgusting products and even animated icons (goofy exclamation points) to represent each team. <P>As for the questions, they\'re straight from the game. However, guessing answers is a legitimate strategy because the game only requires the first three letters for an entire answer to be correct. The topics range from the basic ""Animals of the Cat Family"" to the quirky ""Movies Featuring Airplanes"" or the moronic ""Foods That Create Intestinal Gas."" The variations in topics are numerous, but often you\'ll find yourself a little bored with the repetitive play that this game offers. <P>It\'s not a bad game, but it\'s not a good game either. This is a case of an interesting party game losing its magic when there\'s no party around. Unless you\'re desperate for a version of Outburst! you can play by yourself, you\'re better off sticking with other trivia and word puzzle games. <I>--Tahsin Shamma </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

The Settlers 3,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Ultimate Strategy - On Land, On Sea, On Line', 'Holy Civilization! Something history textbooks seldom capture because they must overcome the limitations of two dimensions, is the painstaking evolution of society. Not to mention how fragile it all is. This real-time strategic simulation of building settlements from ground up is a compelling lesson in just that. Players choose to rebuild the ancient societies of the Romans, the Egyptians or the Asians and work at developing a thriving economy and a powerful military in order to sustain and progress society. None of this is easy. Citizens have to be trained to build structures (110 different buildings), they must weapons, mine ore and grow food. Prosperity depends on wise choices of more than 30 different trades--including woodcutters, hunters, fishermen, farmers, brewers, stone masons, merchants, and priests. Military tactics to protect the settlement and develop trade routes requires legions of archers, swordsmen and spearman ready for battle. What is amazing about his game is that all of this comes to life on-screen, under your nose: The incredible graphics conceptually are like those of the popular ""Civilization II,"" but much more close-up and zoomed-in, so when hundreds of villagers are moving through daily life on your screen, you can see the individual animation of each one--more than 150 characters brought to vivid reality with over 50,000 phases of animation. And the sounds! Hear fish jumping in the stream, or pigs snorting, or laborers breaking boulders. Even birds chirp in this micro, complicated world that Sim City and battle-strategy freaks will find impressive and deliciously animated. (Don Oldenburg, Parents\' Choice&#174;) -- <i>From <a href =""/exec/obidos/subst/partners/marketing/parents-choice.html"">Parents\' Choice&#174;</a></i><br /><br />In the past few months, three venerable empire-building series have all become trilogies. Impressions\' Caesar, Bullfrog\'s Populous, and now Blue Byte\'s Settlers have seen the release of their third incarnation. Each has tried something different. The designers of Caesar III stayed true to the series\' formula, adding a few new features and refining some areas. Populous: The Beginning shares some basic similarities to its two predecessors but is a completely new game at heart. Settlers III, on the other hand, tries to do a little of both. It adds many new features and expands the scope of the series. But while many problems of Settlers II are addressed, many still remain. <P> Settlers III, like its predecessors, combines city building and combat, focussing primarily on the former. It is a game of complex interdependencies. You must gather wood and stone to build structures. To do so, you must have woodcutters and stonecutters. With these basic building blocks, you then move on to mining minerals, such as coal, iron, and sulfur. With these minerals, you begin to build weapons to arm your military and tools to supply your ever-expanding workforce. Miners require food, though, and a variety of food at that. So you must build grain farms, mills, bakeries, fisheries, pig farms, and slaughterhouses. And all of these require carriers to lug supplies around, so you must make sure you have plenty of houses to keep the workforce plentiful. It\'s a good system, but it is basically the same as in Settlers II, with the major exception being that you no longer have to set roads for your workers. That in itself is an improvement, but some more changes would have been welcome. <P> Eventually, you\'ll be able to expand no more, and you\'ll have to resort to military might to push back the enemy borders. Settlers II suffered from its rudimentary combat, which simply required you to send as many forces as you could spare to an enemy fort and hope for the best. Settlers III doesn\'t improve this much. There\'s a slightly different interface, and the inclusion of new types of units (such as archers and spearmen), but these are surface changes and make only a moderate improvement. <P> Settlers III is broken into three campaigns to reflect the inclusion of new cultures. You can play as Romans, Asians, or Egyptians. Each culture features a unique building set and a few slight differences in supply needs and building types. But the new cultures and campaigns don\'t alleviate the major problem of Settlers III\'s mission structure: Each mission is almost exactly the same. You start off with some supplies and must expand until you encounter an enemy. Building up your city takes a great deal of time, and going through the rudimentary steps at the beginning of almost every mission becomes very repetitive. The missions do become harder, but difficulty is almost always determined by the scarcity of resources or the proximity and strength of your neighbors. <P> One area that is completely new to Settlers III is the inclusion of gods. You must build temples, which give you access to priests. Priests have access to a variety of divine intervention spells, such as creating resources or destroying the enemy. This area is interesting, but it isn\'t very well developed. Priests aren\'t integrated into the existing system, just placed on top of it. And more often than not, you won\'t even need them. <P> Multiplayer improves things a bit, as your opponent will likely be more aggressive and won\'t just surrender territory once you consume it. But the pacing of the game and the length of time it takes to build a decent infrastructure makes multiplayer games time-consuming affairs. On the upside, though, the multitude of options (including Blue Byte\'s own free Internet server) makes finding opponents easy. <P> Settlers III looks great and can be played in a variety of resolutions. The cartoonish graphics are colorful and detailed, with the only negatives being the blocky animated cutscenes and the crude interface menus. The interface itself is somewhat confusing as well, and the online-only manual - which details much about the game but does a poor job of actually explaining how to accomplish anything - leaves much to be desired. Luckily, the game is pretty straightforward and can be learned easily through playing. Settlers III features good, if repetitive, ambient sounds, though the clinking combat effects sound like silverware being tossed in a drawer. <P> The only real problem with Settlers III is that, despite all the additions, it doesn\'t really play much differently than Settlers II. With some innovative missions and some more integral changes (or at least better-integrated changes), Settlers III would have been a much better game. Those who love the Settlers formula will enjoy it, but those who are unfamiliar with it will likely find it to be a moderately fun multiplayer game and an immensely repetitive single-player game.<i>--Ron Dulin</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Disc(s) are professoinally cleaned. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', 'It took a couple of months, but the Dreamcast finally has a wrestling game. But before you run out and buy a copy of WWF Attitude, there\'s really some things you must know about it. This game was produced on a very tight deadline. You see, Acclaim will lose its license to produce and sell WWF games on November 15. That means the company had to pump out this Dreamcast version as quickly as possible, because once 11/15 hits, no more copies can be manufactured. So the Dreamcast version is, essentially, a cleaned-up clone of the PlayStation version. The improvements are mostly limited to graphics (better textures) and sound (higher fidelity). Therefore, if you already own one of the other two versions of Attitude, and you are relatively happy with the version you have, you can pretty much sit this one out. <P>The roster in WWF Attitude was reasonably current when the game was originally released on the PlayStation and the N64 back in August. Now, the lack of superstars like the Big Show, Chris Jericho, and the Dudley Boys really make the game feel much more dated. However, one plus is that D-Generation X has gotten back together recently, so at least that aspect of the game is correct. <P>The game is reasonably good for a wrestling game, which is to say it has just about as many weird, quirky collision problems and ""which guy am I facing"" issues as the next game. The game shies away from much of the rampant button-mashing, which plagues other wrestling games, in favor of a more fighting-game-like approach. This means you\'ll be doing a lot of ""left, right, down, button"" type of moves instead of just grappling, hitting a button and a direction, and watching the fireworks. Momentum also comes into play here, which makes it easier to pull off larger, grapple-based moves on your opponents if you soften him up with a few punches and kicks first. The game also has a few reversals here and there, so it\'s important to vary your method of attack, especially against experienced players. <P>There are also a whole lot of modes in the game, most of which are slight variations on the same type of match. You can throw down in standard versus matches, two-on-one fights, three-on-one matches, tornado bouts, and tag-team contests, among others. There are also modes based on some of the WWF\'s more famous Pay-Per-View matches, like the Royal Rumble and the Survivor Series. The Rumble pits you against 29 other wrestlers in an over-the-top-rope brawl. In the real thing, a new wrestler hits the ring one at a time, after a set interval, though here the number of simultaneous wrestlers never gets higher than four. There\'s a slight pause while a new wrestler enters the ring, but it\'s nothing too serious. Add to that various match conditions, like hard-core matches or first blood, and you have enough options to keep you creating your own pay-per-views for months. <P>Graphically, WWF Attitude is a mixed bag. On one hand, it looks much better than the N64 and PlayStation versions of the game. It sports much better textures (though many of the wrestler faces still look pretty bad), a cleaner-looking crowd, and cooler effects. But on the other hand, as a Dreamcast game, it easily could have been better. The wrestler models are still on the blocky side, and the animation looks pretty choppy. The sound has been greatly improved from a fidelity standpoint, but the commentary still manages to sound a little choppy from time to time. Also, the commentary is a little too generic, staying away from calling out specific moves and only occasionally calling the wrestlers by name. <P>With a few more months, this game could have probably turned out a lot better. But since the game is the very definition of the word ""rushed,"" it\'s merely a rehash of the older versions of the game. If you didn\'t buy the PlayStation or N64 version of Attitude in hopes that the DC version would beat them, then you\'re getting a bittersweet victory. Yes, this is the best version of WWF Attitude, but no, it doesn\'t live up to the potential of the license or the hardware, and it\'s really a shame that Acclaim has to end its longtime relationship with the WWF on such a sour note. Rent this one first before making your decision. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Pitted against an alien invasion, players will need to use their wits in this epic battle against the Ethereals, Mutants, and Sectoids.', ""Following in the footsteps of X-COM UFO Defense is no easy task. A modern classic of strategy war gaming, the original X-COM combined an amazing turn-based battle engine with a complex resource management system to become one of the most addictive and innovative games of the last few years. <P> Relocating the battle from outer space to inner space, X-COM Terror from the Deep creates a scenario where a long-dormant alien race is awakening from the ocean depths. Once again you must take command of the X-COM troops, leading them through battle and managing ever decreasing funds to improve your facilities. Everything that made the first X-COM such a success is still present in Terror from the Deep, but very little has been added to the formula. <P> Apart from new art and a handful of new combat options, this is exactly the same game as UFO Defense, only much more difficult. The story follows an identical pattern, ensuring that discoveries and important events are easily predicted by X-COM vets. Even though the new alien races and weapon technologies may appear different at first, it gradually becomes apparent that they're the same races and technologies, with new names and new faces. <P> This rehash leads to some logical errors which are difficult to overcome, especially considering the new aquatic locale. Even though most of the missions take place underwater, you can toss grenades around with ease, and you must develop special suits to allow your soldiers to move vertically (apparently the X-COM training camp doesn't including a swimming class). <P> Anomalies aside, Terror from the Deep is still a great game, but it seems more like an add-on than a bona-fide sequel. Fans of UFO Defense will find a pleasurable challenge in the cagier alien artificial intelligence, but interested newcomers are likely to find much more pleasure in the original.<i>--Ron Dulin/SpotMedia Communications</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

And as the dirt track shifts and moves into ruts and grooves beneath the riders' wheels, players must constantly make subtle adjustments to keep control. It's loud, fast--and memorable--stomach-churning fun. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", ""Supercross and the Nintendo 64 haven't really gone hand in hand. Supercross fans looking for gaming goodness have been all but forced toward the PlayStation. EA Sports' Supercross 2000 strives to fill the gap with a heavily licensed endeavor. The game is broken up into two styles. The racing mode puts you on lots of different tracks, while the freestyle mode puts you in a large area populated with jumps, bowls, and other air-enablers. On paper, both modes look really cool, but the game's control really isn't up to snuff, and this takes a lot away from what otherwise would have been a pretty good game. The problems surface when you make turns. The game tries to make turning realistic, in that your rider will put his foot down if you jam the stick all the way to one side, but you never seem to turn with a tight enough radius to feel fully in control of your bike. Turning problems aside, the game features a pretty nice physics model, and the bikes buckle and bounce in a realistic fashion after big jumps. Graphically, the game looks a little boxy, especially the racers' legs and torsos, but everything runs at a good frame rate with or without the expansion pak, which lets you run in a higher resolution. It's a fair trade-off, as a lower frame rate at the expense of better-looking models would have hurt the gameplay quite a bit, especially in the two-player split-screen mode. The game's sound is every bit as annoying as real supercross races, complete with grinding, buzzing motors. The play-by-play is low on the personality meter, sticking strictly to calling out passes, tricks, and other semi-important events. If you're a fan of supercross, and you've been waiting for a good game to come along on the N64, Supercross 2000 is good enough as a first effort, but hopefully we'll see some control tweaks and some improved performance in the sound and graphics departments in the unannounced-but-you-know-EA-will-eventually-do-it sequel.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Rayman travels through six fantastic, fanciful worlds on his quest, searching for six caged collections of Electoons per world. Along the way Rayman occasionally meets a friendly female fairy named Betilla, who is slowly regaining her powers as Rayman does his thing. She doles out extra, sometimes comical, powers to Rayman like helicopter ears and flying, glowing punches."", 'Each level is chock-a-block with bizarre and zany enemies, beautiful and incredibly imaginative scenery, and several, secret side-trips. As you complete various sections, and gain more powers, you can click on a map and return to previously played levels and seek out those hidden goodies.', 'Despite its beauty and magical qualities, several flaws scratch at my craw. As is true for many side-scrollers, there are minimal save options which lead to terminally tedious replays. You have to complete several scenes before an auto-save kicks in. The only way to see the fanciful introductory animation is to load a ridiculous 50 MB on your drive, while a ""full"" install takes a sublime 94 MB! I did the medium load, watched the animations, then did a minimum, 10 MB reinstall. Plus some of the secret locations are darned difficult to find, even using the tips available on Ubi Soft\'s website.', 'Rayman is side-scrolling, comic animation at its finest.

Links LS Extreme [Old Version],,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games']","{'Shipping Weight:': '7.2 ounces', 'ASIN:': 'B00002S78P', 'Item model number:': 'C34-00001', ' Date first listed on Amazon:': 'May 10, 2002', 'Discontinued by manufacturer:': 'Yes'}","['Links Extreme is a fantasy golf experience inspired by Happy Gillmore -bizarre on the surface but fiercely competitive underneath. Play Poison, Deathmatch and Extreme Golf, or practice your anger management skills on the Demolition Driving Range!', 'Before I realized how much skill golf requires, I ranked it right up there with cricket and bowling as one of the most unexciting spectator sports ever (OK, so cricket and bowling take some skill, too). But instead of just resigning myself to avoiding golf whenever it came on TV, I dreamed up ways to make it more exciting. One of my favorites was for golfers to act like pro wrestlers, with lots of smack-talk and face-to-face confrontations so we\'d have good guys to cheer for and bad guys to root against. I also thought things would be a lot more interesting if golfers had to jog between holes (a wrinkle that\'s now the basis of the International Speed Golf Association). I kept coming up with new twists - souped-up golf carts and rally-style cart paths, eliminating out-of-bounds markers and letting players get to each hole any way they like, adding an option to throw the ball onto the green instead of chipping - and regaling my friends with my plans to bring golf down to a whole new level. <P>So you can understand why I was pretty intrigued by Links Extreme, which lets you play with either explosive balls of varying strength or a set of ""prank"" balls you can use for your own shot or to ruin your opponent\'s score. After a few rounds with this novelty game, though, I quickly realized that what sounds hilarious over a couple of brews at the 19th Hole Lounge isn\'t necessarily such a laugh riot in practice. <P>The problem with Links Extreme isn\'t that the concept isn\'t good or that the game couldn\'t have been fun, it\'s that Access and Microsoft took a good idea and ran all of about ten yards with it. Take the golf venues, for instance. With only 27 holes to play - 18 at the fictional voodoo-drenched tropical island of Mojo Bay, and a measly nine at the WWI-battlefield course Dimension X - it takes just a few rounds to see just about everything here. Actually, that\'s not quite true: If you look closely, you\'ll see all kinds of nifty animations, like zombies plodding across the fairway with outstretched arms at Mojo Bay and swooping biplanes and bombed-out buildings on the Dimension X course. But because there\'s no option to walk the course, the only way to get a close-up view is to whack your ball toward \'em - not exactly the most inviting way to savor these little Easter eggs. <P>Then there are the balls. The exploding ones are fine and dandy by me, but the addition of ""prank"" balls is a little more dubious. I don\'t have a problem with the ones that you use to improve your own shots, like the tee ball (any lie becomes a tee shot), the slam-dunk putt (ball bounces and plops into hole), the distance limiter (travels only as far as distance marker), or the rocket ball (you can blast it over 400 yards). The balls actually add some nice twists: You can blast through trees or land on water to turn a nightmare hole into an easy birdie or even an eagle. But the ones you use on your opponents seem sort of gratuitous, because hitting a decent shot (you click when the power meter is between two blue markers) nullifies the prank. The only players who\'ll have to endure these bedeviling tricks are ones who can\'t hit a good shot in the first place. <P>Oh wait - I almost forgot to mention the Demolition Driving Range, where you hit those exploding balls at targets moving at various speeds across the range. The reason I almost skipped over it, though, is that it\'s fun for all of about five minutes - and you can\'t even compete against another opponent for a high score to make things even marginally more interesting. <P>The one area where Links Extreme could shine is in its multiplayer game - in fact, it\'s the only way to use the prank balls. But in my numerous visits to Microsoft\'s Gaming Zone, I found zero players to compete against. <P>Like earlier entries in the Links series, Links Extreme features 2- or 3-click swing types and a power stroke that lets you slide your mouse to determine shot strength. But in keeping with the focus on action rather than pure golf realism, you\'ll also find a kwik swing - aim and click once, and the ball always goes straight (this is only available on the Demolition Driving Range). And totally inept players will appreciate the amateur swing: click, hold, and release the mouse button, and the ball heads dead-on to the aiming marker; and the power of the shot is determined by where you placed the marker. <P>Being a long-time Links veteran, I opted for the 3-click swing - but for some reason I found my accuracy dropped off pretty drastically compared to my performance in normal Links games. Putting was especially irksome for me - I found myself continually coming up short on relatively easy putts - but I also had unexpected trouble with simple tee and fairway shots, too. But that\'s definitely a subjective complaint, one definitely overshadowed by more overarching problems. <P>The shame is that there are all sorts of little things Access and Microsoft could have tossed into this half-baked mix to give it more of a kick. Mustard-gas balls, an option to lay barbed wire behind you, or even a sniper gun (using it would cost a stroke) would be cool on the WWI course; at Mojo Bay, the zombies and crocs should make off with your ball, and I would have loved to have had a doll I could prick with needles to torture my opponent. But these suggestions bring up the dilemma facing the developers of Links Extreme: Make it too extreme, and you run the risk of irritating your primary, golf-buying consumer base. Make it too cutesy, and the action gamers you hoped to coax into trying a golf game will laugh you out of town. The end result is that Links Extreme tries much too hard to stay squarely in the middle of the road - and winds up going nowhere fast.<I>--Stephen Poole</I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

But the fact is, a good PC pinball simulation can be a great deal of fun, and Addiction Pinball is almost as good as any pinball sim around. <P>The game comes with two tables, both of which are based on other Team17 games. This device works well because the basic gameplay of the originals - Worms 2 and World Rally Fever - provides a good setup for the tables' strategy. On the Worms table, the object is to score kills and complete missions by using specific combinations of shots to the various ramps. Here, hitting a specific ramp at a specified time is more important than scoring points. The Rally Fever table provides a more repetitive strategy where the duplication of certain ramp shots is the key to winning. <P>While it doesn't have the ultrarealism of a game such as Pro Pinball: Timeshock, Addiction Pinball offers more sensory gratification. The table design is really impressive. The tables look and feel like they were meant to be full-fledged arcade table designs. The ball physics, surface friction, and momentum forces respond realistically within the game, and pinball purists will be hard-pressed to find faults. And for those of you who even like the video modes of current stand-up machines, Addiction Pinball gives you some arcade action as well. <P>Addiction Pinball does contain a few irritating elements. The first is the Worms 2 table. If you find the voices of the worms from the original game annoying, you're going to be enraged by the time you finish one game on the Worms table. The Worms table provides too much flavor of the original game in the form of sounds and cutesy worm ambience. As for the Rally Fever table, such recycling of materials is justified and almost appreciated; in racing games, the squeal of the tires and the voice of the race announcer is an important factor. <P>In the end, Addiction Pinball is recommended if you're looking for a solid simulation. If you can handle Team17's style of self-promotion in the tables' theme design, you're going to enjoy the experience on the whole. <I>--Tahsin Shamma </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Forsaken - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The Terran System, once proud birthplace of humanity, now lies forsaken, utterly abandoned and up for grabs. Only decades before, the Earth had rested smugly in the knowledge that no alien force could possibly penetrate its staggering armada of defense satellites, orbital minefields, and computer-controlled attack systems, all of which patrolled the space ways vigilantly. Invasion from an alien race was inconceivable. Ironically, though, the end did not come from without, but from within. In the year 2113, humanity destroyed itself when it sought to harness the universe\'s most powerful and dangerous energy source. <P> For many years particle physicists on Earth had been delving deeper and deeper into the mysteries of matter itself. Unraveling layer after layer of subatomica, they finally discovered the means by which they could manipulate matter at its most basic level. Tragically, their first experiment created an uncontrollable fusion reaction, which ripped apart the planet, sending an irresistible shock wave through the entire Terran System. When it was over, the Earth was devastated. <P> Torn from its orbital axis, the fragmented planet was now a lifeless, hulking husk, devoid of atmosphere and bathed in the searing radiation of the sun. Within a few agonizing days, all human life had perished. News of its extinction spread quickly through the universe, reaching the High Senators of the Imperial Theocracy, the ruling body of the multi-verse. A thorough investigation into the mind-boggling disaster began. Anything considered valuable on Earth was shipped out of the system. Robotic military personnel were then deployed to watch over the dead world. <P> Months later, the solar system was declared ""Condemned."" Now, every bounty hunter, mercenary, space pirate, and free-booting scum of the earth in the galaxy has the unwritten right to raid the system and take anything that the Theocracy didn\'t want. The worst cutthroats have converged on this blackened corner of the universe to engage in a desperate game of interstellar cat-and-mouse. Astride roaring antigravity pioncycles with deadly arsenals, they will battle to the death against each other and the dead world\'s ruthless robotic sentinels. For the one who emerges victorious, the lost glories of a dead civilization await. For the rest, only agonizing death.', 'Remember Descent? You know, the crazy zero-gravity first-person shooter that put you in the cockpit of a small ship and forced you to reenact the end of Return of the Jedi over and over again? Forsaken is, at its core, a Descent clone. But stunning graphics, a dazzling array of weapons, and above-average level design make the whole thing seem fresh. <P>The simple scenario sets the game on a postapocalyptic Earth. Most of the planet is in ruins, complete with loads of goodies ripe for the taking. You play a scavenger on a hoverbike, and you\'ll traverse military installations, nuclear reactors, refineries, temples, and more in search of gold and crystals. This may sound like a cakewalk, but Earth\'s automated defense systems are still intact, littering your path with all kinds of annoying drone ships, tanks, and turrets. Rival scavengers will also pop by from time to time in an attempt to take out their competition. While none of the enemies proves to be a threat on its own, their sheer numbers make the game incredibly difficult. While most of the levels are of the ""just get to the exit"" variety, a few are timed. The time given, however, is incredibly generous, so there\'s never a real race against the clock. <P>The weaponry in Forsaken is unique. Each weapon has three levels of power, depending on how many power pods you\'ve found. The Suss gun is a spread-fire weapon that quickly shoots a mess of projectiles in your enemy\'s direction. The Trojax is a charged weapon that gains power (and sucks ammunition) when you hold down the fire button. The Pyrolite is a beautiful-looking flamethrower. Transpulse shots can bounce off walls, making them good for surprise attacks in multiplayer games. The Beam Laser simply emits two monstrous beams of death. It requires pinpoint accuracy, but it does insane amounts of damage. Secondary weapons include the Scatter missile, which causes the victim to drop all of his weaponry. The Multiple-Fire Rocket Launcher quickly spits out tons of small missiles. The Solaris homes in on its target. The Gravgon missile creates a vacuum at its point of impact, sucking enemies into its gravitational field and holding them in place for you to take out at will. The Titan is the most devastating weapon in the entire game and will frequently take you out as well if you aren\'t careful. There are also three different types of mines that will help you keep enemies off your tail and a nitro boost that will allow you to escape from sticky situations. <P>The multiplayer feature in Forsaken is well done in some ways, but in others it\'s a mess. The largest oversight has to be the lack of a dedicated server option, which would make it a bit easier to find a game. If you\'re looking for a Forsaken game on the Net, chances are you\'ll have to venture into a chat room and hope someone is advertising a game they\'re hosting. However, some of this hassle is offset by the server machine changing when necessary. If the current server quits or crashes, the game finds another suitable machine in the game and makes it the server. This makes finding a game to join a bit harder, though, as a game that started out on one IP may now be running on a different IP. Another problem, which Acclaim is working on, is that the multiplayer mode tends to crash from time to time. I frequently encountered crashes when changing levels, and on more than one occasion I became disconnected from all the other players, leaving their bikes seemingly unattended in the middle of the level. Forsaken is pretty modem-friendly, but you\'ll want the server machine to be on at least an ISDN line - if not a cable modem or a T1 - if you\'re planning to play with more than eight players. <P>The graphics in Forsaken look pretty good unaccelerated, but once you throw an accelerator board at it, it looks simply outstanding. Colored lighting abounds, and it really sets an appropriate mood for the game. Weapon fire is beautiful, and the shockwave generated by the Titan looks really, really good. The sound in Forsaken is also well done. There are several different characters and bike computers to choose from, resulting in a mess of different voices for power-ups and damage. A few of the characters swear, but only if the mature content is enabled from the options menu. <P>If you\'re a Descent fan, well, you probably stopped reading about four paragraphs ago and you\'re already halfway to the store. You won\'t be disappointed, especially if Acclaim can work out the multiplayer bugs. Acclaim is currently working on a Forsaken level editor that will surely extend the game\'s life - but the great graphics and difficult yet exciting gameplay are already enough to keep you interested for a fairly long time. <I>--Jeff Gerstmann </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

British Open Golf (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['It would seem a fool\'s errand to enter a field as crowded with stiff competition as golf simulation. But if anyone can face up to the challenge, it\'s Looking Glass. Not only do they have a proven ability with graphics rendering and real-world physics, but the team is also headed by the man who pretty much invented the computer golf simulation. Rex Bradford not only programmed Mean 18 - the first computer golf game - but also created the sadly UNpatented ""power bar,"" which has been used in every subsequent game. <P>Add in the exclusive license to re-create the most revered golf course in the world, another exclusive license with the oldest and most prestigious golf tournament in the world, and the announcing talent of ABC\'s Jim McKay, and you have a pretty good recipe for success. But does British Open Championship Golf make the most of this recipe? For the most part, yes it does. <P>As golf sims begin to blend together, BOCG strives to carve out a style uniquely its own and largely succeeds. First off is the look, one of the most important parts of any golf sim. BOCG\'s graphics, which are scaleable up to 1024 x 768, stretch out to the horizon, with elegantly rendered terrain and detailed objects. Since the game models links courses - which tend to be open and flat - the effect is important in capturing the feel of the location. Instead of golfing through a tunnel of trees, you\'re aiming for the St. Andrews clubhouse. There\'s a kind of hazing effect, almost like watercoloring, that also adds to the unique look, and helps evoke the misty, gray weather of the British links. <P>Another visual element that radically sets BOCG off from the pack is the presence of crowds. Golf sims have always been very solitary experiences, and British Open changes that. Onlookers gather to watch and react to shots. They\'re not very animated, but they do make the proper ""oo"" and ""ah"" noises for good and bad shots. A satellite view and another viewing window of your choice can be open at all times. Viewing angles are handled well, with custom camera placement and instant reverse angles. Control is a mixed bag. Aiming is efficient, but the yardage information for your aiming spot often disappears before you can read it. You can aim in any open window, and swinging is done with the familiar three-stage power bar. The best element of the control interface is the shot designer. In most golf games, you have the option of changing club height or angle and foot placement, but it\'s hard to tell just how this affects a shot. In BOCG\'s shot designer, several pre-designed shots are included to show you the basics. As you change things like foot placement, you see just how the shot will play. You can then save effective shots for use later. This is probably the best custom shot builder in any game to date. <P>Shots themselves respond very realistically and the physics modeling is one of the strongest yet. Unfortunately, there is an apparent glitch in the swing interface that causes the power bar to run at varying speeds mid-swing, resulting in an occasional hitch in the flow of the swing that can greatly reduce accuracy. The putting swing meter is novel, being a flat meter instead of a circle, but putting introduces a new set of problems. Greens are very hard to read, and the grid is quite badly implemented. The result? Too many unnecessarily bad putts. This is a shame considering the overall excellence of the design, and it will hopefully be fixed. <P>Play and scoring options include stroke, match best ball, tournament, practice, and single hole. Tournament play is where BOCG floors all the competition. You can begin at several points in the British Open, against a leaderboard filled with the greats of the game. As you go through the rounds of a tournie, you watch your position change on the leaderboard, the crowd around you waxes and wanes, and the competitors grind you into the dust. The commentary is terrific, with few repetitions and much interesting, relevant, and accurate patter. From the camera towers to the VIP tents, this IS the British Open experience, and it\'s a competitive golf experience second to none. <P>The most important element of BOCG is the courses. Only two ship with it St. Andrews and Royal Troon - but these are two of the greatest courses in the world, and you\'ll only play them here (at least until someone makes Jack Nicklaus 4 versions). These are links courses: Devilishly difficult to play but not the lush, manicured, ersatz-Augusta courses we expect in the US. British Open captures them beautifully, with every bunker and hill modeled to perfection. Detailed strategy videos begins each game, giving some history and insight into the course. Your onscreen caddy (another first) also has a course book with him that you can access from any shot, with advice on the best way to play a hole. <P>British Open Championship Golf is a unique entry into the world of golf sims that is sadly brought down by a few flaws. The last and maybe greatest of these flaws is the absence of multiplayer capabilities, though Looking Glass is working on this now. If the swing worked a little more consistently and putting was handled better, this could have been recommended without hesitation. As it is, it\'s still a good game with much to offer. <I>--T.

One member of the council began to practice the black arts and spread destruction throughout the land; he became know as the Warlock Lord.

As the last member of the forgotten royal family, you are the only one who can stop the Warlock Lord and save Kal Torin. The trek through Shadowgate castle will not be easy, and will require strength of mind and body. Will you be able to stop the Warlock Lord in SHADOWGATE CLASSIC?', ""Shadowgate first hit the good old Nintendo Entertainment System back in the mid-'80s, a time when RPGs were a curious rarity on the console scene. It's interesting to note that in a time when the genre has finally achieved mainstream status, this game has been rereleased with no changes. Many will say that you can't improve on a classic. Lots of other people will be wondering why they spend half their time navigating menus. I'm going to admit to something here. For the first two hours of playing this game I couldn't get past the room you start exploring the dungeon in. Embarrassing? Sure, but it's more annoying than anything else. This is two hours spent looking blankly at two screens, reading the same text over and over, and trying to figure out what the heck you're supposed to be doing. Eventually the solution - opening the skull on the front door and taking the key that lies inside - became apparent, but it served as an ominous warning. The puzzles in Shadowgate Classic aren't obvious and are difficult to solve, and they don't get any easier as the hours go on. In fact you could swear that the game runs on its own unique logic system, one that bears no relation to the world you and I live in. The number of buttons on the system and the screen's limited resolution don't lend themselves too easily to the RPG genre, but the developers have done a good job of fitting it all in. A screen full of menu options is always available and lets you do things like take, look, open, and use objects and peruse your inventory. Picking up a sword on the floor, for example, requires a few clicks of the A button and a few seconds spent moving the cursor around the screen. It's not the best interface in the world - in fact, it's downright ugly at times - but it does work. Eventually. Graphically this is a decent game, with good backgrounds and fairly good use of color throughout. NES- devotees will see that everything looks exactly as it did then, which is apparently a good thing. It would have been nice to see some of the machine's extra memory put to good use - ever hear of animation that uses more than two frames, Tecmo? Or screens with more than eight distinct colors? Apparently not. At least this ensures that the game plays just as well on a monochrome Game Boy as it does on a Color one. One thing Shadowgate does have going for it in the presentation department is the music. It's moody, atmospheric, and somehow manages to sound decent when pumped through the machine's tinny speakers. Progress through Shadowgate is slow. We're talking watching-grass-grow slow, here. A typical session can last a few hours, thanks to the sloth-like control system and the amount of time it takes to get from one room to another. While this is fine for RPG fans who want longevity, it's still a strain on the eyes. The biggest problem Shadowgate Classic has is that it has not improved with age, and newcomers will fail to see the original charm hidden under the unintuitive gameplay. Those who are old enough to have played the game in its original incarnation will quickly find that this is a game that really only needs to be played once.<i>--Cameron Davis</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

After all, only a lucky few have ever actually flown a real F-16, so no one will notice if the plane doesn\'t capture the precise ""feel"" of its real world counterpart. Unfortunately, the designers of Virtual Pool do not have this luxury. Since all of us have held a cue stick at least once in our lives, Interplay has to ensure that the table physics are 100 percent accurate in order to suspend our disbelief. <P>To this end, the Celeris design team employed mathematicians and physicists to ensure absolute realism. As a direct result of their meticulous attention to detail, Virtual Pool succeeds in reproducing every possible nuance of the game. In fact, Interplay claims that the physics are so accurate that it will actually improve your real-life pool game - or your money back! <P>Of course, outstanding physics are useless without a control scheme that allows you to actually take advantage of them. Fortunately, Virtual Pool utilizes one of the most elegant and responsive interfaces ever created for a computer game. By providing a direct link between the mouse and the motion of the onscreen cue stick, Virtual Pool allows you to recreate all the draw, English, and spin you would apply to an actual cue ball. All you have to do is line up the shot, pull back on the mouse, and then stoke forward as you would a genuine pool stick. By moving the mouse gently, you can make smooth and accurate shots. If you roll the mouse with force, you can send the onscreen balls careening off the rails. This direct interface is so convincing that you can almost feel the contact with the ball. <P>Once you have mastered the art of the cue, you can challenge one of the nine computerized competitors to a game of 8-ball, 9-ball, or straight pool. In addition, numerous multiplayer options allow you to hustle a friend using the same machine, or even remotely via modem or IPX network. <P>Virtual Pool is like a real pool table crammed onto a tiny CD. The accurate treatment of table physics not only duplicates the mechanics of pool, but also the intuitive interface replicates the elusive ""feel"" of the game - which is the highest praise that can be awarded to any simulation. <I>--Jim Varner </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Redneck Rampage (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Just when it seemed that publishers had shipped every possible variant of the first-person 3D shooter, Interplay has pulled the genre from the swamp. <P> And they did it with redneck jokes. Redneck Rampage packages the Duke Nukem 3D engine with a low-concept theme - invading aliens are cloning backcountry hicks - that could have very easily fallen apart. But Redneck Rampage works on several levels - as a shooter, adventure, and humor title. This is a clever, fun, and challenging game with great characters, crisp sound effects, and inventive - though at times very frustrating - gameplay. <P> The backwoods deep south is near-universally the butt of jokes, and the game delivers them through the perspective of Leonard, the game\'s rampaging hero. In the opening scene, the Jim Varney-lookalike cocks his pistol and says he\'s ""out to open up a can o\' whup ass."" His goal is to kill off the aliens who snatched a pig right out of the bed of his pickup and, it turns out, are starting their invasion of earth by cloning the moronic local folk. The aliens in the first few levels are chirping, feces-flinging gremlins, while the local yokels greet you with shotguns and rifles. Vicious dogs attack without provocation, with the exception of one mutt that remains frozen in mid-leap until you get his attention with a bullet or crowbar. <P> Though the tabloid alien-abduction plot feels a bit dated, there\'s more than enough splatter and gags to compensate. The player sends Leonard into a sewage treatment plant, dairy, junkyard, mobile-home park (complete with a nasty tornado problem), and other locales. He must find the skeleton keys that help him work his way to the nose-picking, crotch-adjusting Bubba and whap him upside the head with a crowbar to complete each level. Our hero\'s arsenal includes weapons such as a scattergun, a dynamite crossbow, and a gun that launches ripsaw blades. Thanks to the Build engine, he can blow up cows, trash jukeboxes, smash windows, and generally leave destruction in his wake, just as Duke could. <P> The game\'s humor works. Xatrix Entertainment invested the time to load Redneck up with endless little in-jokes and details - the game is a rich, twisted parody of the deep south. Moon Pie snacks become Cow Pie power-ups, and Leonard has a repertoire of post-killing punchlines such as ""You plays with the bull, ya gets the horns."" Other touches of humor are more subtle. If Leonard dives into a well and swims along an underwater tunnel, he\'ll come up for air in the outhouse. Health is restored by drinking moonshine and cheap-ass whiskey - but watch your intake! Too much \'shine and you\'ll be lurching out of control. While Leonard can ""take a quick pee"" to sober up a bit, more obvious scatological gags fall flat - including the straining, splashing sound effects that start up whenever he nears a toilet. <P> Farts aside, the game\'s sound effects are sharp, from the echoing crack of an automatic rifle report, to the crash of pins in the bowling alley, to Leonard\'s painful ""ow!"" when he\'s hit or bitten by a giant mosquito. The Reverand Horton Heat pumps out of jukeboxes in several parts of the game, and Mojo Nixon and The Beat Farmers are included on the game\'s soundtrack. <P> While shoot-outs are fun, a strong adventure element underscores the gameplay. Leonard must open fridges, run machinery, climb hidden ladders, and ride concealed elevators. The player can easily get stuck, wandering endlessly in search of the well-hidden key that will open a door and advance a level. Interplay is likely doing great business with their 1-900 hint line. Controls can be frustrating to get the hang of, especially when the player is trying to time a crucial split-second jump from a wrecked car or a bale of hay. One such jump demanded 15 or 20 practice runs. On every other level, this tight maneuvering, combined with the sometimes too well concealed skeleton keys, stalls out the otherwise addictive gameplay. <P> Overlooking the controls and difficulty issues, this is a fresh, funny, inventive take on a formula that grows more tired every time the FedEx guy shows up at the GameSpot offices with a box. If you liked Duke Nukem - and you\'re ready for a twist - you\'ll find Redneck a hoot. <I>--James Glave</I> <BR><I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

In under two years Earthworm Jim has made the evolutionary circle complete by returning to its roots, the computer, where Shiny entertainment first breathed (programming) life into this lovable, sardonic, super-powered nematode for their cartridge game. Now Activision has brought that same fast-paced, side-scrolling action game to the PC with more levels, more weapons, and a chance to trick-out your work area with a Jim desktop theme that plugs into Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95. <P>Like The Simpsons, this animated character traverses the terrain between slapstick humor and social commentary--you could even call it subversive. With the same mastery that ported Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure from a cartridge game to a PC game, Activision has done justice to Jim with a righteous conversion. <P>The keyboard serves as a decent controller for this side-scrolling game, but to skillfully dodge and shoot the biggest bosses you'll want to play this one with a gamepad. The game is Windows 95 native, so it integrates smoothly into your desktop and there's no installation. Now all Activision has to do is convert the rest of my favorite SNES and Genesis games to PC, and I'll be completely content. <I>--Jeffrey Adam Young </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Heroes of Might and Magic II,,[],"['Video Games', 'Mac', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>The Succession Wars</i> is the highly anticipated sequel to the award-winning 1995 release <i>Heroes of Might and Magic</i>. Having crushed his enemies, consolidated his power base, and eliminated dissent at the end of <i>Heroes of Might and Magic</i>, Lord Ironfist settled down to rule the land of Enroth. After 25 years of peace, the land is again thrust into turmoil. Lord Ironfist is dead, and the ensuing battle for power between his sons, Archibald and Roland, has led to a state of war. Players must choose sides and summon their armies as they use all of their strategic wit and tactics in the battle for domination of the lands.', 'In our March \'97 issue (p79), we warned you against Heroes of Might and Magic, not because of the game, but because of the port quality. With the sequel, Heroes of Might and Magic II: The Prince of Loyalty, we can skip right to gameplay, because there\'s nothing wrong with this version technically. <P>The game mechanics haven\'t changed much from the original: You still control castles and heroes, and your goal is to take over the other castles and defeat all other heroes on the gameboard. There are six different types of heroes and castles - barbarian, sorceress, wizard, warlock, necromancer, and knight - which control different species of fantastic creatures - goblins, druids, golems, rocs, mummies, and calvary, to name just a few. Castles provide troops and the funding needed to hire them. To improve both troops and income, a hero needs to claim control of a variety of building materials scattered throughout the countryside. Improving the fortifications requires wood and stone and leads to better defense, whereas mercury, gold, and sulfur allow you to upgrade the mage tower which gives a hero more spells to cast. Opposing heroes vie for control of these resources. <P>The sequel adds more hero types (necromancer, wizard) and their associated monsters (vampires, halflings). There are more buildings on the playing field, and you can climb a tower to get a glimpse of the surrounding countryside, even of places you can\'t physically reach yet. The castles have been upgraded, with more options: You can build a captain\'s quarters, turrets and a moat for defense. If a hero isn\'t in the castle when it\'s attacked, the captain leads the defense. You can also upgrade the creature habitats: cavalry become champions, giants become titans, and liches become power liches. <P>Battle mechanics are slightly different from the original. Your hero gets a number of spell points, and once he or she runs out, no more spells may be cast. There are also some new battle spells: the ""death ripple"" is amusing to watch as it ripples along the screen, wounding all living creatures in its path. The death ripple can be countered with a ""holy word"" spell, which clouds the video and wounds undead creatures, such as vampires and liches. If your hero runs out of points, you can take him or her to a castle to recharge (but not during battle). <P>Completely new in the sequel are campaign intros which introduce the opposing forces. You can choose to play the good (outcast and honorable) or evil (in power but oppressive) side. We found the campaign scenarios difficult after the first few levels. If you get stuck, play a standard game, and work up to beating the expert levels at the highest difficulty rating, and then go back to the campaigns. <P>The game is zippy on a standard Power Mac. However, if you\'re running on a 68040, turn off ambient animations and computer opponent animation. Our only nit to pick with Heroes II is that we wish that ports would use the standard file dialog for saving and opening games, and that the light source for shadows was in the Mac-standard upper left corner. Still, if you\'re a role-playing or strategy fan, you\'ll have tons of fun with Heroes of Might and Magic II. - Kathy Tafel <P>Good News: Completely upgraded. Runs well on \'040s. Better port than original. Fun for weeks, not hours. <P>Bad News: Nonstandard saving mechanism. RAM-hungry. <P><B>Rating:</B>4/4', '&copy;1999 MacAddict -- <i><a href=""https://secure.imaginemedia.com/group/maca/8VPX.html"">From MacAddict -- Subscribe now!</a></i>']","by

Starship Titanic (DVD) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['NEW, in the original retail BIG cardboard box. Sealed. Windows 95, 98 DVD-ROM', ""For years now the adventure genre has been a stagnant place, overwhelmingly dominated by two styles. At one end you have the descendants of Myst, tours through rendered locales filled with mysterious gadgets and artifacts that you must learn to operate. At the other end you have the heirs of King's Quest, defined by sprite-based animation and inventory-based puzzles. It's a rare occasion when something innovative comes along, and games that do break from the formula - The Last Express, Bioforge - are all but overlooked by the general public. In this environment, Starship Titanic occupies a unique place. It isn't particularly innovative, but neither is it a Myst or a King's Quest clone. Instead, it draws upon storytelling and puzzle-solving styles that originated in the text adventures of old, and is a somewhat refreshing game as a result."", ""The text-adventure feeling makes logical sense. One of the creative forces behind Starship Titanic (science fiction humorist Douglas Adams) developed two such games for Infocom. Those who have played Adams' text adventures (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Bureaucracy) will feel right at home on the Starship Titanic. The puzzles involve the same type of overly complex logic, requiring you to go through mind-wrenching ordeals to accomplish the simplest of tasks. While there's nothing on par with the classic Babel Fish puzzle from Hitchhiker's, the majority of the puzzles keep with the same absurd spirit - such as when you must deal with a complex mechanism simply to turn on the television in your cabin."", ""The text-adventure references don't end with the puzzles. The game actually includes a text parser that is used for conversing with the many robots aboard the Titanic. It's not perfect (your statements will often be misunderstood in unfathomable ways), but it's a nice nod to the days of old. The use of the text parser adds an element of discovery as well: The solutions to otherwise obtuse puzzles will often become apparent through conversation."", ""But Starship Titanic lacks the one major element that elevated so many text adventures to classic status: a story. There's a slight skeleton of a plot (you must repair a derelict starship), but apart from discovering why the Titanic is in the shape it's in, there's nothing to it. The game does borrow a bit from older adventures (the moody robots bit is almost a direct lift from Steve Meretzky's Stationfall), but it doesn't create enough of a backbone to lend much purpose to your actions."", ""That's not to say it isn't fun. It is certainly funny - and it's the kind of funny you'd expect from such contributors. The voice acting brings the humor to life (two Monty Python veterans make appearances - Terry Jones brings his talents to the annoying parrot, and John Cleese makes a particularly funny appearance as a bomb), and the graphics are good-looking, Myst-esque fare. All in all, Starship Titanic is an enjoyable tribute to an older era of adventure gaming. It feels a bit empty at times, but Douglas Adams fans and text-adventurers will undoubtedly be able to look past its shortcomings. <i>--Ron Dulin</i>"", '--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

You'll solve puzzles and fight bad guys, and, on the last level of each zone, you'll get to face off with one of the Evil Prospector's boss toys. So onward... to infinity and beyond!"", 'Within the first few minutes of the Disney/Pixar film Toy Story 2, you can already see how the game will follow suit. The movie\'s plot, while it has great pacing, is candidly segmented, and the action is mission based and rooted in specific geographical locations throughout the game - Andy\'s House, Al\'s Toy Barn, The Airport, and so on, just like in a game. The PlayStation title rearranges the order of the sequences a bit but essentially tells the same story, with the same colorific characters and the same amusing antics of search, rescue, crazy happenings, and - eventually - escape.  Toy Story 2 is something like n-Space\'s Rugrats: Search for Reptar in that it has mission-based levels set off a hub, which, in both cases, is a house, and that it follows the film\'s scenarios to a T. Toy Story 2 is larger, with about 15 levels (three levels within five zones) you can play through them either as quickly and easily or as difficultly as you wish. By picking up all the items and solving all  the puzzles, Toy Story 2 has a bit more complexity than Rugrats, which probably exists more in the ""good for kids"" category. Toy Story 2 wants to appeal to a broad range of gamers, not just kids, and this is obvious in its level design. In each of the levels, you have several objectives. You have puzzles to solve, tokens to collect, enemies to fight, and items to find - in addition to a boss fight at the end of zone. However, once you complete one objective, you have the option to move on, fight the boss, and work your way to the next zone. It\'s usually easy to acquire 50 tokens in a level, as they\'re scattered about the environment, often lending clues as to which obstacles you can jump on, and so forth. You can also pick up tokens from dead toys you\'ve destroyed with your Buzz Lightyear laser. Eventually, you must go back and replay levels, if you haven\'t picked up all the goods, as you\'ll need a decent-sized stash of Pizza Planet tokens to advance toward the final stages. But as in any game, you learn certain skills as you progress that will make stages that had seemed difficult in the beginning much easier. Another big surprise comes in the graphics department; the PlayStation version looks surprisingly better than even the N64 version. With movie license games, it\'s easy to assume that the PlayStation/N64 trade-off, should both versions exist, will be graphics for the N64 and sound and FMV for the PlayStation. This is not the case. The PlayStation version actually has it all. Scenes from the movie advance the plot; the scenes appears before and after the game and between levels, and it actually looks a bit better than on the N64  - which has simplistic, underwhelming stills with rudimentary text that look that look almost like placeholders in lieu of the animated cutscenes you get with the PlayStation title. Otherwise, the environments are colorful, easy to get around, and fairly free of the depth-perception problems all too common in PlayStation games that involve jumping from one place to another. A really nice touch was Buzz\'s reflection being visible from inside his space helmet when you\'re in targeting or close-up mode.  The cameras presented a bit of a problem, however. You could choose passive or active cameras, with either you in charge of the camera or the camera in charge of itself. You decide. What\'s good is that you can change between active and passive cameras on the fly during gameplay. You\'ll probably find yourself doing this quite often in the beginning. When the active camera is agreeable, it\'s suspiciously good. But then, seconds later, you\'ll find yourself cornered in an alley, pushing a box next to a chair that you must jump on to leap onto a scale that will in turn send you soaring into the air looking for the best place to land. This isn\'t fun with a camera whipping around you like a mosquito, yet you\'ve too much going on to manage your camera while you navigate your jumps, grabs, and leaps. This becomes a problem far too often, dragging the game\'s overall score down a bit and keeping the graphics from a potentially higher visual score. It\'s certainly not the worst camera system out there, and you will get used to it and probably settle on the active camera at some point, cursing your way through the game. The camera proves the game to be yet another notch away from being a kid\'s game.  For a movie with generous voice-over already in the can, you\'d expect an overload of catch phrases and one-liners in the licensed game. This is not the case, and Crystal Dynamics could learn a thing or two for Gex from this one. It\'s a simple model: Less is more. The voices from the film are intact, but they\'re not out of hand, at least Buzz\'s voice isn\'t. It does get a bit annoying when Hamm whines, ""Buzz, come \'ere"" the entire time you\'re in his territory. And Sarge\'s pep talk gets old pretty fast. But for the most part, the catch phrases are few and far between - just enough to make it interesting without driving you to the brink. And the music? Toy Story music. \'Nuff said.  <I>--Lauren Fielder </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Virtual Chess 64 - Nintendo 64,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Transform your N64 into a powerful chess adversary. The most awesome chess engine adapts to any skill level. Learning is endless fun yet even superb players face the maximum challenge. Brillant graphics brings this classic game alive.', 'Titus has introduced the first chess simulation for the N64, Virtual Chess. Even with most of the options available to PC chess players, 14 skill levels to choose from, and animated fight scenes for the kiddies, the 3D view\'s lack of visual clarity makes for a frustrating game. <P>Virtual Chess offers most of the options computerized chess should. For the novice, there\'s a simple but thorough tutorial. Broken up into slim chapters, it\'s easy to use, whether you\'re just verifying the rules for taking pawns ""en passant,"" or trying queenside castling for the first time. A save-game feature allows you to see just how stupid a move is before committing to it permanently. Unfortunately, there\'s no option to just retake the last move, so if you\'re hesitant, save early and save often. If you\'re still feeling squeamish, there\'s an onscreen CPU next-move suggestion button available at all times. <P>Play in Virtual Chess is plain hard to see. The pieces are difficult to tell apart from any angle, so you\'ve got to be extra careful to avoid stupid mistakes (or be surprised when the enemy ""king"" easily avoids check by sliding across the entire board). To this end, plan on spending a lot of time rotating the board, which turns a full 360 degrees horizontally or vertically. If you were some kind of crazy nut, you could even attempt to play looking at the felt on the bottom of the board. Unfortunately, the board only spins on either axis in one direction, so if you miss your spot, you have to go all the way around again. Thankfully, a 2D version is also included, but that removes the whole point of the game: the fight animations. <P>The game would be better off without them anyway. Had they occurred on the regular playing screen, that would have been one thing. Such is not the case. Every time a piece is captured, all the pieces shoot into the air, the screen goes all crazy, and... the board appears again, with a cutscene featuring stylized representations of the capturing piece and its victim squared off to fight. The black knight is a battering ram, the white a unicorn. The black bishop is some sort of mosquito creature, the white a wizard. The black queen is overweight. Yawn. The animations are jerky and slow and lose their appeal after the third time or so. Thankfully, they may be turned off. <P>Ever since R2D2 and Chewbacca first played their first near-deadly game of holographic chess (""Let the wookie win""), it\'s seemed like a good idea to offer a chess simulation that comes equipped with 3D fighting sequences for the captures - and this did prove somewhat successful with Empire Interactive\'s Combat Chess for the PC. Unless the fighting actually occurs fully rendered using the same engine as the rest of the game, rather than as an annoyingly distracting cutscene, the novelty will always fade fast. Masters and novices alike will probably quickly strip Virtual Chess down to its clearer, more practical 2D mode after a minimum of laughs are achieved from the fights. Even in this mode, the game provides a great tool for fans of the ""real thing"" of any skill level. --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Blast Chamber,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Some folks will do anything for money. Take the contestants of the futuristic gameshow, Blast Chamber, who tote time bombs on their backs as they gamble life and limb to amuse a worldwide audience and make some quick cash. These volatile competitors set upon one another in enormous, cubic, violently rotating metallic battlefields called blast chambers in a race to stave off a personal doomsday.Hearkening back to the simpler days of gaming, Blast Chamber is a stylish four-player action/puzzle game with straightforward mechanics: run, jump, shove, and survive. Your kill clock immediately begins its countdown when the game opens, and if it hits zero you go kablooey. The key to survival lies in the conspicuous golden crystal, which materializes at a random location in each chamber. An aptly-colored transmitter for each player beckons, and 20 precious seconds are added to your timer when you deposit the crystal into your own transmitter. Or, players can take the offense and drop the crystal in the other guy's terminal to shave a third of a minute off his limited life expectancy. Adding to the frenzy in this mad race against time are traps deadly enough to make a torturer blush; powerups that include speed bursts and magnetic shoes; and pressure panels which rotate the chamber 90 or 180 degrees without warning. In the one-player puzzle mode, you have to run the gauntlet, collect the crystal, and drop it in our own transmitter before the bomb goes off. Expect to decorate over 60 Blast chambers with your remains.Each chamber is 3-D and texture-mapped, complete with player-controlled camera perspectives and colored lighting effects. The tiny player characters are animated sprites that look like motocross bikers decked out in primary monochromes and thick padding. A typical techno soundtrack, your token smug female announcer, and an uninspired assortment of generic grunts combine to make a game that looks much healthier than it really is.You see, Blast Chamber is great concept that doesn't reach its potential as a game. Far too often, to seize control of the crystal you'll find yourself mashing the shove button instead of winning it through skill or wit. The small on-screen characters are difficult to follow, the play control is too loose, and the explosions are unimpressive. And for all the reckless competition that Blast Chamber offers, there simply isn't enough game to keep you occupied for long - let alone through 60 cubes. The computer opponents are hopelessly dumb, making the single player game a dull exercise in personal Armageddon.When four players take to the virtual battlefield the action gets very hot. Unfortunately, poor sound and a mediocre visual presentation bog the package down. Blast Chamber could have used more time in the oven, and a greater variety of unexpected events and details would have put this game over the top. As is, Blast Chamber is a little more than an enjoyable party game. Too bad, it could have been a real blast. --Greg Kasavin <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Grand Theft Auto: London Mission Pack,,['First expansion pack for a console game; must own GRAND THEFT AUTO to play; start as small time criminal; steal cars; obey the English rules of the road to remain unnoticed'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['London 1969 - You are a stylish hooligan entering a new decade of grievous bodily harm car-jacking and general thugggery. Drive Run and Shoot your way into all sorts of trouble with the law ruval gangs and civilians. Warning requires original Grand Theft Auto disc to operate. Parental advisory - Explicit contents.', 'The original Grand Theft Auto delivered a new type of experience. The overhead ""crime spree on a disc"" managed to be more than just a shocking, violent game. It was just plain fun to drive around, get into a four-car pileup, hop out of your stolen car, mow down four or five pedestrians with a machine gun, and blow up a few cop cars for good measure. GTA: London 1969 bridges the gap between the first game and GTA2, scheduled for release later this year. As one would expect from a mission pack, there haven\'t been many changes made to the formula, so only those who still enjoy aimlessly driving through the streets of Vice City in search of a new car to steal and blow up need apply. <P>Though mission packs have long been a part of PC gaming, there really hasn\'t been any solid add-on technology on consoles. GTA London requires that you own the original GTA disc (Rockstar is selling the two discs together under the name Director\'s Cut, in case you don\'t have the full game) and makes you put it in while starting up as part of its bizarre swap trick-esque startup sequence. You boot up the system with London in the unit. It\'ll tell you to put in the original disc, spin for awhile, and then tell you to put the London disc back in the drive. Whether this is because it\'s actually using game code from the original disc or just trying to keep people from playing the cheap add-on without buying the more expensive full game is unknown, but I\'d suspect it\'s the latter. <P>The differences between the mission pack and the old GTA levels are minimal. If you want to stay legal, you\'ll want to stay on the left side of the road. You\'ll also be entering and exiting vehicles on the right side of the car. This will initially cause a bit of confusion. I know it caused me to get caught by the cops (er... nicked by the bobbies... whatever) more than once. All the speech has been replaced with the slang and accents you\'d expect to find in London around 1969. The music has also been completely revamped, and it fits the scenario nicely. The graphics are mostly new as well, providing new textures for buildings (there were a lot of pubs in London back then, I guess) and new cars, including an Austin Powers-esque ride, complete with accompanying secret-spy music. <P>The GTA London mission pack really doesn\'t hold a candle to GTA\'s original three cities, but it still manages to be reasonably fun. If you\'ve still got that itch to jack fools for their rides and smoke cops (and honestly, who doesn\'t?), then GTA London should make the wait for GTA2 a little bit easier to bear. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Dark Rift's ultra high frame rate ensures fast animations."", 'With every release of a new system, there is a series of firsts that help define the system - and ultimately who will be best served by it. The Nintendo 64 has already had its first original sports game, its first shooter, its first racing game, and its first arcade translation. Dark Rift is the system\'s first native fighting game. And if indeed this game helps to define the Nintendo 64, it chalks up another point in the ""not bad, but I wouldn\'t actually pay money for this game"" column. <P>Dark Rift is the product of Kronos, the same company responsible for the abysmal PlayStation fighter Criticom. While Dark Rift isn\'t a sequel, the lackluster fighting contained on the cart might as well have been culled from a mythical realm called Criticom II. On the upside, Dark Rift isn\'t quite as bad as Criticom. But the two games are still a little too similar for Dark Rift to slide through the VGS offices unscathed. <P>The graphics of Dark Rift represent the game\'s lone strength. The characters move very quickly, and for the most part, smoothly. Also, the N64\'s graphical prowess is exploited in this title, resulting in some nice lighting effects. The only dull point is the characters themselves: they\'re very blocky, presumably to keep the frame rate up. <P>Playing Dark Rift can be compared to playing Konami\'s classic arcade game, Track & Field - the faster you pound the buttons, the better you\'ll do. The three attack buttons are part of the C button cluster, which makes it nice and easy to hit them all with only one finger. So easy, in fact, that I\'m typing this part of the review with one hand - the other being on the three attack buttons and the block button - and I\'m still winning. Fun. Aside from these buttons, there are two sidestep buttons (only helpful when trying to avoid projectiles), a throw button, and a special button. The latter doesn\'t do anything when pressed by itself, but when combined with fireball motions or double taps, it executes fireballs, super kicks, and a few other moves, depending on the character. <P>With its questionable character design and repetitive gameplay, the only gameplay variation Dark Rift brings to the fighting game table is its default three-out-of-five matches (as opposed to the standard best two-out-of-three). The rest feels like a Virtua Fighter-inspired mishmash of monsters, demons, and guys with guns. The graphic effects are the only things that save Dark Rift from falling below average. As much as I hate to say this, I\'d rather be playing War Gods. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

In development for almost three years, Guilty Gear is just that - a 2D fighter with enough originality and flavor to earn its own place in this once-dominant genre. Let's explore."", 'In Guilty Gear you take control of one of ten characters, which are available from the outset. These fighters are a mix of the usual Ken/Ryu/Zangief ilk, with a little Samurai Shodown thrown in for good measure. The difference here is that these characters are designed with a flair not usually seen in a ""serious"" fighter. Character artwork is fantastic and lends the game an incredibly manga feel without being too derivative. As with Samurai Shodown, most characters utilize a weapon of some sort, ranging from the usual Excalibur-type sword, to some futuristic-looking blades, to a sickle and chain. Some characters, however, fight with only their fists and/or hair. It\'s this sort of diversity that keeps Guilty Gear fresh and not too confined to one particular premise.', ""Gameplay is confined to the usual fireball motions, double air jumps, super moves (called chaos moves), and counters. The difference in Guilty Gear, as opposed to something like, say, King of Fighters, is that the GG fighters move with an ease that rivals even Capcom's elite, and in some cases, even surpasses them. It's surprisingly agile for a PlayStation fighter, and you'll find the control impeccable. In addition, you won't be hampered by choppy animation; instead, each character has a wealth of moves and supers, each rendered in stunning detail, which complements the pinpoint control. In fact, the PlayStation handles so many frames of animation, with very little slowdown (except when doing screen-filling chaos moves), you'll wonder how Arc Systems fit it all in the meager amount of RAM available - transparencies, multiple blue shadows, fast and fluid animation at little cost to the gameplay. The only noticeable defects in the presentation are a fairly high amount of pixelation in the super moves and very little background animation. Even so, you'd be hard-pressed to even notice, since everything moves so fast and furiously."", ""Sound-wise, heavy metal style is the order of the day - a choice that is a nice contrast to the techno-heavy soundtracks of games like Tekken 3 and the nondescript music that litters most of Capcom's fighters. It certainly adds an aggressive edge to the proceedings. Sound effects are extremely well done. On a good sound system, your house will quake each time a hit lands or two swords meet. The soundtrack and the crunchy sound effects combine to create a truly awesome sound experience. Thankfully, Atlus hasn't messed around with the voices as it had been contemplating. Everything has basically remained intact from the original Japanese version."", ""The downside to this great fighting game (especially when you consider how long Arc's been working on it) is the lack of options. OK, there's a training mode and an options screen, which lets you mess with things like match time, but there's little else. You can't set the number of rounds or adjust the difficulty, things that seem peculiar by their exclusion. Another problem with Guilty Gear, and it's not the only one, er, guilty of it, is the extremely cheap bosses. Anyone who's played a Fatal Fury or X-Men: Children of the Atom knows about cheap bosses. Same thing applies here. Fortunately, you can continue as much as you'd like and switch characters after each defeat, so you can find someone who'll get you past the last boss. Unfortunately, once you unlock the secret characters, you can only use them in vs. mode, which is a bummer since Baiken is such a cool boss. It's always better when you can use them in one-player mode."", 'To summarize the Guilty Gear experience is to look to the best parts of other four-star fighting games. Fast, furious action, with truly awesome characters and moves worthy of the Darkstalkers series, Guilty Gear is one of the few non-Capcom or SNK 2D fighters to make any sort of impact on the genre. If you like 2D fighters with a little flair, GG comes highly recommended. With its excellent gameplay, surprisingly good graphics, secret characters, and kick-ass aural experience, Guilty Gear (minus some spit and polish) is as good as it gets. --James Mielke <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

You will - and the company that will bring it to you is Activision. Other mech games may claim to be a great combination of simulation and action, but only MechWarrior 2 comes close to the mark. <P>MechWarrior 2 on the PC was an incredibly intense and detailed game. There were controls for just about every function imaginable. The game featured numerous missions, many taking a lot of time and skill to complete. The PlayStation version is different from the original in many ways: The controls have been tailored for the system, and the game has been retooled, with a more intense focus on action. The result is game that will receive decidedly mixed reviews. Fans of the original will likely feel the game has been watered down to appease the younger-skewing console demographic. While this may be true, fans of video games will discover a truly fun shoot-em-up. <P>MW2\'s graphics are nice from a distance, but up close the moving polygons (especially the parts of a mech, which scatter when destroyed) look pretty pathetic. The fiery explosions look good, but usually result in lame-looking mech parts flying about. The in-game music is just plain bad, and the rest of the game\'s sound effects are merely adequate. <P>The control is a bit strange at times. But after little use, control becomes second nature. The default settings are nowhere near what the game can truly do, however, as they don\'t allow targeting or torso twisting. This means the default setting forces you to line up your shots by hand and always face the direction you wish to shoot. After messing with the default setting for ten minutes, you\'ll want to configure your controls to one of the full-featured settings. Suffice to say that without torso twists and targeting, you probably won\'t make it out of the first few missions. <P>The game features 16 new missions and 32 re-worked versions of popular PC campaigns. From the main menu you can choose between the Wolf Clan and Jade Falcon squads or use the ""instant action"" feature to get right into battle. Either way, expect to spend a lot of time blowing stuff up - each mission revolves around destroying something (regardless of whether your mission is offensive or defensive).

By winning races, the characters earn tokens that can be used to open new tracks or buy vehicle upgrades. In addition to the racing, there are number of mini-games to be discovered. Try to beat Pete's henchmen and reclaim the decorations in MICKEY'S RACING ADVENTURE."", ""It would be very easy to dismiss this title as just another fluff Disney game, but the fact of the matter is that Mickey's Racing Adventure is a solid choice for racing fans. The game is viewed isometrically, and you control Mickey, Minnie, Daisy, Donald, or Goofy as they race around tracks filled with obstacles, ramps, power-ups, and Pete's evil cronies. Many of the races consist of both land and water tracks, and you'll instantly switch vehicles on reaching the shore. Each character has a special vehicle, as well as two others that can be purchased with Disney Dollars, which are earned for racing expertise. All of the cars can be upgraded - you can purchase a better accelerator, top speed, and turnbox for each car. These are necessary to complete the game, for as more difficult tracks are unlocked, opponents' vehicles are upgraded automatically. You can also purchase and cast magic spells to disable the competition on the track. In addition to the tight racing are scores of minigames, from a Pipes-style game with a locomotive to Pluto's eight Bone Hunt challenges, which he literally has to dig up to play. Maneuvering the characters around Mickey's world is a task in its own right, as Pete's goons are on the loose and they will steal your hard-earned Disney Dollars if you come into contact with them. The graphics of Mickey's world are nearly perfect: All of the characters are animated as well (if not better) as they are in a Disney cartoon. The musical score is dynamic and vibrant - a pleasant change from the usual three-note themes that are repeated endlessly in so many Game Boy titles. The visuals and the sound during the races themselves aren't up to par with the rest of the title, but they get the job done more than adequately. With more than 20 tracks and six characters to choose from, this title shows how Game Boy racers should be done.<i>--Doug Trueman</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Each samurai carries a distinct identity -- monk American ninja snow maiden aesthetic perfectionist etc -- and special feature allows player to determine one of two ""moods"" for each attack -- ie Chivalry or Treachery. Player controls all 12 characters. Also features \'Rage Gauge\' and \'Power Gauge\' to intensify every attack. With 24 different attack modes and 96 special moves and full-power attacks.', ""Shodown III held its own in the arcades. But until the release of King of Fighters '95 and Fatal Fury Real Bout for the Saturn, SNK has had trouble converting its games to the home platform. The burning question: Would Shodown III safely make the transition? The answer: Samurai Shodown III for the Playstation is really good, but not really great. <P>Some animation frames from the arcade version of the game have been cut, and the gameplaying speed on the Playstation is somewhat slower. It's a solid game - that is, as long as players are willing to deal with the excruciatingly long loading time. Even so, the gameplay is still there - along with vivid colors and SNK's detailed character art and backgrounds. <P>It would seem that the name of the game in Samurai Shodown is patience. For players who like to whale on the buttons, prepare yourselves for a big time beating. Players should instead look for openings and slice away. Since this game doesn't really have a combo system, players have to string together moves slowly, methodically countering their opponent's swordplay. This can lead to some long bouts - a departure from today's fighters, which are designed to guzzle quarters as fast as possible before going to the consoles. <P>Changes from Samurai Shodown II are many. Each character now has an alter ego with tweaked moves, and players can also choose among the many difficulty settings. For example, new players can make their character always block; more experienced players can eliminate blocking; and there's even an option that gives players a full desperation move meter throughout a match. These options are a nice touch - especially for those who are otherwise discouraged by the move complexity in the fighting game genre. <P>Those who loved the arcade game version of Samurai Shodown III will be happy with this conversion. Those who have never played the game should give it a try - they'll probably like it, provided they can stand the loading time. --Nikos Constant <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Machine Head,,['PS1'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['If you disassembled Machine Head and looked only at its constituent parts, it would seem like you\'d have a pretty great game on your hands. The graphics and sound effects are excellent, you have loads of super-destructive weapons at your disposal, and there\'s enough of a storyline to tie everything together. Put it all together, though, and you don\'t have much: Machine Head is a prime example of the whole being nowhere near the sum of its parts.  <P>The plot follows the standard ""the end is nigh"" sci-fi scenario typically tacked on to games where the basic goal is mass destruction. It\'s the ever reliable ""near-future,"" and a deadly virus is destroying the human population. Assigned to contain the virus, you must head out on your heavily armed hovercraft and blow away everything that crosses your path. To continue this trail of mayhem, you are charged with seeking out the keys which will allow you access to the next area. The story, of course, is totally forgettable once you\'re in the game - which would be fine, if the game was at all fun. <P>But it isn\'t. The most striking problem with Machine Head is the control. The directional pad is used for looking around, the L1 and R1 buttons for firing, and the shaped buttons for moving. The result is a mass of confusion, and it takes awhile to get comfortable just moving around, let alone aiming and firing at fast moving opponents.  <P>Adding to this confusion is the difficulty you\'ll encounter just navigating through the levels. Your so-called hovercraft will get hung up on the most minor piece of scenery, and the levels are littered with debris that impairs movement and filled with narrow passageways which are difficult to maneuver through. Finally, everything looks so similar to everything else that you\'ll often find yourself wandering around aimlessly, with no idea where you are or where you should be. <P>Machine Head isn\'t all bad - the soundtrack is a thumping techno affair; and the graphics are really cool with nice environments filled with fast-moving mutants and insect-like opponents, building cocoons on power lines. But sound and graphics do not make for a good game. That is to say it\'s somewhat difficult to sit back and enjoy the game\'s nice aspects when you\'re constantly groaning in frustration. --Ron Dulin <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

The first 3D Shanghai game for the Playstation game console. Select from 2 modes: original and arcade Shanghai. In each of these modes choose from a further 3 ways to play: classic; rolling; and battle Shanghai. Against the computer or a friend whichever way you decide to play Shanghai True Valor is ""The"" definitive puzzle game.', 'Shanghai. A puzzle game that has been with the human race since before time was time. OK, maybe not, but it\'s certainly been floating around on PCs and console systems for many years now, even if it isn\'t exactly ancient. If you\'ve never played it before, it goes something like this: mahjongg tiles are set up in a complex pattern a few deep, and you must remove them from the playing field in pairs. Tiles you remove must be free to slide to the left or right and must match each other. It\'s basically just another form of solitaire - using tiles instead of playing cards.  Simple? Yes. But it is also a nice, mellow time-waster, and that\'s why it\'s been around as long as it has. It\'s nothing to get excited about, obviously, but it does offer some mind and finger activity. True Valor endeavors to liven up this traditional game with some new modes, and they aren\'t half bad. To begin with, there are classic and arcade modes; classic has no time limit, but arcade does. Arcade also has different levels, which can be accessed through a password. It\'s kind of bizarre that the game uses a password system - as it frequently alerts you, it writes to the memory card. The only thing that is saved, however, is system data. There is also a new ""rolling"" Shanghai, in which the tiles are set up around four sides of a cube, and L and R rotates this construct. Not exciting, but it\'s something.  This brings us to versus mode: a cute idea for what is essentially solitaire. In this mode, you get to pick your favorite ancient Chinese warlord to represent you in the Shanghai arena. (As you will discover if you read your history, the ancient Chinese often ended deadlocked battles with a calm game of Shanghai.) You are then presented with two side-by-side mini-Shanghai setups. Clearing blocks quickly and cleanly adds to the mayhem on your opponent\'s side. The loser is the one whose time runs out first, as clearing a set of blocks also momentarily halts the flow of time. It\'s not exciting, but it helps add to the variety of the game, and that\'s always a good thing. On a technical level, Shanghai is about as polished as you\'d expect from a bottom-tier developer on this generation of the PlayStation. The tiles are polygonal, but there seems to be no reason for this until you play rolling mode, since in classic mode this only serves to obscure the tiles\' faces due to the mediocre texture quality of the game. The background is made of low-key stuff like blurry battlefields and harbors. More of an eyesore than eye candy, it gets the job done... just barely. There are only three tile sets to choose from: traditional mahjongg, household, and alphabet. Household is easily the most confusing and garish tile set that could have ever been conceived, so it really boils down to two. The music is on the same par as well. You\'re probably going to want to find your own CD to listen to while you play the game. Still, it can\'t be denied that it\'s fun in a low-key way. Add in the variety of modes and you\'ve definitely got something. It just boils down to whether you\'re the kind of person who is in the mood to play solitaire. If so, go for it. Otherwise, there are only several hundred other PlayStation games on the market. I\'m sure you can find something more suitable to your tastes. If you even remotely think you might enjoy this, though, rent it. You might be surprised.<i>--Christian Nutt</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Practice is just you and the track as you learn the different twists and turns forming each course, while Time Trial has you trying to improve your best lap times and course records. The one-player game involves competing against five computer drivers in either the Arcade or Championship mode. Arcade mode involves racing each track in an attempt to finish first. Players begin this mode with 45 seconds on the clock and must cross multiple checkpoints within the time limit. If time should expire before reaching the checkpoint, the game is over. Championship mode is a season composed of multiple races, with each race earning you points depending on how well you finish. The winner of the event is the driver with the most points overall. These races can also involve optional pit stops, which come into play whenever your car needs fuel or new tires, although it should be noted that cars do not experience damage in the game. By finishing both the Arcade and Championship modes on both difficulty levels, players will be allowed to access additional cars. Automobili Lamborghini also lets you customize the following areas: number of laps, control sensitivity (analog or semi-analog), and the number of races comprising a circuit.

It's your challenge to complete each of 31 levels with all three Vikings alive and kicking. Features new characters: Scorch the fire-breathing dragon and Fang the werewolf. With 5 different worlds to explore -- endless terrain and a host of fierce enemies. For 1 or 2 players."", ""The original Lost Vikings was a surprise to everyone. The name was kind of goofy, the gameplay was strange, and yet somehow...it was still fun to play. Typically when a company has a surprise hit like this, it's quick to make a sequel and cash in on the hype. Fortunately Interplay has instead decided to surprise the gaming community again by putting out a solid action-puzzle title that is not only good, but in fact, far superior to its predecessor. <P>For the most part, the games are very similar. You have three Vikings you must lead through a series of increasingly difficult mazes. Each of the Vikings has his own area of expertise - Erik is really fast and can jump, Baleog is a badass with sword and mace, and Olaf can block attacks with his shield and glide. Each of the 31 levels is filled with all kinds of obstacles that can only be bypassed by a player who can figure out the way to use the each of the Viking's, er, unusual talents to his full advantage. Sound simple? It's not. Most players will find themselves searching the Web for hints after about an hour of play. The game offers up some pretty tricky action challenges as well, so you would do well to remember that figuring out how to beat a level is only half the battle. Veterans will also notice the addition of two new playable characters, Scorch the dragon and Fang the werewolf, who add a whole new set of skills and challenges to the game. <P>Although it's no visual feast, Norse by NorseWest still looks pretty good for what is, at its heart, a puzzle game. All of the characters and enemies are rendered in 3-D (but tiny) and move fluidly throughout the skillfully detailed backgrounds. Sound is also solid, featuring some pretty humorous voices from the Vikings themselves, and some surprising sound effects from the rest of the menagerie. <P>Norse by NorseWest is a good puzzle game that offers just enough action to keep it interesting during long play sessions. Although it doesn't have enough of the hack-and-slash element to appeal to hard-core action fans, its extra long levels, solid animation, and inspired play mechanics are sure to please just about any fan of the genre. --Trent C.

R-Type DX,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Game Boy Color', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""A deep-space probe has uncovered the Bydo Empire's secret plans to mount an attack on Earth. A full-scale assault force would be detected by the Empire's long-range scanners and any hope of surprise would be lost. Our only chance is for a single pilot in a lone R-Type fighter to penetrate the Bydo defense system and destroy the evil Empire before it can launch its attack."", 'R-Type is the video-gaming version of a one-hit wonder. Irem\'s genre-busting side-scrolling shooter made its arcade debut in 1987, a time when hydraulic gismos such as Sega\'s Space Harrier and Out Run took everyone\'s attention and subsequently their quarters. The game was a sleeper hit and went on to spawn a billion home conversions, sequels, and clones, but Irem had lost its way. While the company had a few mildly successful titles roll out the doors, none of them matched the classic status R-Type eventually earned. Irem quickly faded into obscurity and eventually finished operating a few years ago. With only a standard cabinet and monitor housing the game, R-Type had to rely on its graphics and playability to draw in players. Like in Defender, another classic shooter, the longest game a first-time player will experience is typically no more than 30 seconds. Thirty confusing, crushing, and completely humiliating seconds. The key to successful play is precision, timing, and knowing the level ahead, rather than mindlessly stabbing the fire button and moving all over the screen. Every time you play R-Type you get a little bit further or learn a new technique that opens up more possibilities. It\'s basically the thinking-person\'s shooter, and it\'s here on the Game Boy Color. R-Type is no stranger to Nintendo\'s handheld - the original arcade conversion and a specially crafted follow-up were released for the monochrome platform. R-Type DX contains both of these games in their original black and white glory and separate colorized versions. The ""DX"" in the game\'s title refers to the new DX mode, where both games are combined into one challenge, and the graphics are further enhanced. If that\'s not enough, there\'s a new level to work your way through. As a Game Boy conversion, R-Type DX does an admirable job. The enemy attack patterns, level structure, and H.R. Giger-inspired graphic design are all here, albeit in miniaturized form. Boss creatures - who are still some of the most fearsome looking creatures to have been seen in video gaming - are intact and fill up the screen with consummate ease. Level 3, which takes place around a giant multiscreen battle cruiser, is particularly impressive and is one of the best ways to show off the machine. Not bad at all for a decade-old 8-bit gadget. Oh, and before we forget, there\'s the music. Shoot-\'em-up music is typically never that remarkable, but there\'s something memorable about R-Type\'s tunes. Not so much a soundtrack as an anthem to great gaming, the tracks have been reproduced here perfectly. The boss theme in particular is still one of the best tunes in gaming - foreboding and catchy at the same time. Certainly, it\'s not a perfect package. The diminutive playing area means there isn\'t a lot of room to dodge bullets, which will probably make experienced players change their strategies. Further aggravating this problem is the unreliable collision detection. It\'s so slack that if it were a parent it would be up for criminal negligence. Sprites, which usually mean enemy bullets, power-ups, and moving objects, can make contact with you to no effect, while backgrounds kill you instantly from a distance. While the overall package isn\'t as refined and full of cool bonuses as other ""DX""-branded titles - Super Mario Brothers in particular - the core gameplay makes R-Type worthwhile. It\'s still one of the best shooters you can get for any machine, and the GBC version does the series proud. Excellent.<i>--Cameron Davis</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Timeshock Pro-Pinball,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""TimeShock! is the second game in Empire Interactive's Pro-Pinball series. Like its predecessor, the Web, TimeShock! is a pinball simulator. Empire Interactive created TimeShock! much like a real pinball machine. All the operator settings are there and can be changed. You can execute light, sound, and bumper tests just like it was a real machine. The trouble is, if we really wanted a pinball game this accurate to the real thing, wouldn't we just go out to an arcade and play the real thing?"", ""The TimeShock! table is a good one. It has things like magnetic ball saving, lots of different modes, multiball, and everything else you'd expect from a modern pinball machine. With the controller you can nudge the table, activate the ball saver, and, of course, control the flippers. It responds just as you would expect it to respond and puts on a pretty good act. But it is an act. A PlayStation controller simply can't replace an actual machine. At times, you'll almost feel like you're playing a real pinball machine... except most real machines don't have loading times."", ""The game's graphics are decent, although everything has a very fuzzy look to it. The dot-matrix back-glass display looks reasonably cool, as well. The game's sound (flipper noises, the sound of a ball heading up a ramp) is incredibly close to the real thing. The game's music, however, is just plain bad."", ""If this game had more than one table, it would come across a whole lot better. Also, if it did some things that a real pinball machine couldn't do, it would make sense. As it is, you just can't justify this as being a worthwhile purchase. Yes, the TimeShock! table is good, but Empire should really just start making real pinball machines instead of wasting its design talents on simulations. If you're a monster pinball fan, then you'll get some play out of TimeShock!, but wrapping your hands around a PlayStation controller simply can't stand up to wrapping them around the real thing. --Jeff Gerstmann <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

That\'s definitely the case here. Pandemonium\'s extraordinarily silly (and not very funny) storyline exists only to string together the graphically diverse levels - and make no mistake, the graphics are the main attraction here. As for gameplay.... <P>Pandemonium has that unfortunate platform-game trait of forcing players to screw up certain puzzles before they learn to solve them. On the very first level, for example, players must fall straight down a wall in order to land on an important ledge. However, players won\'t know about the ledge (because the camera view prevents it) until after they plummet past it. The dramatically moving camera can also be thought of as a gameplay element. In fact, the camera zooms in and out of the luscious 3-D environment, making the gameworld so enticing that players presumably won\'t notice they\'re engaged in a glitzy game of run-jump-shoot. The few power-ups are fun (including a fireball, a freeze ray, and a shrink ray that zaps opponents into stomp-size morsels), though unoriginal. Pandemonium also commits the crime of never establishing clear personalities for Nikki and Fargus, whose morphing abilities only compound the problem. Their only real difference is that Nikki can jump high, and Fargas has a monster-killing tumble move. <P>Burke Tresichmann\'s jaunty music veers into the Calliope Zone at times, and some of the selections sound much like his previous scores for Captain Quazar and The Horde. Moreover, the sound effects are downright awful, and the rubber-bandy ""boing"" that accompanies each jump is more than annoying. <P>Despite all of its nifty graphics, Pandemonium doesn\'t have what it takes to contend with the latest 3-D action games, like Crash Bandicoot and Tomb Raider. Ultimately, Pandemonium is a game for run-and-jump junkies who\'ve already beaten those two offerings and are still looking for an angry fix. --Peter Criscuola <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

It\'s essentially a third-person arcade-style shooter where you sail the high seas - well, OK, more like the high lake, since the initial levels\' bodies of water are entirely surrounded by land, but no matter - battling other pirate vessels and destroying the gun turrets and flamethrowers (on a pirate ship?) of defending ports in an attempt to spread your swashbuckling reign of terror.

The only real design flaw is that the backgrounds and perspectives sometimes make it hard to see what you\'re doing. Frequently, when you\'re in a really narrow causeway, you can\'t see yourself over the hedgelike rows of beach flora. Sure, there are three different perspectives, but when you\'re fleeing electric squid through giant rotating buzz saws, there really isn\'t time to toggle camera angles. <P>Initially, control seems pretty easy. Movementwise, all you have to deal with is rotating on a center axis and moving forward. There is no reverse, no strafing, and (obviously) no jumping. When you get into combat, things get a little sticky. Your primary method of attack is with cannonballs. You can either fire one shot dead ahead or a cluster of four to the port or starboard sides. So, you\'re continually lining up your spinning vessel with your enemies either dead-on or to the left or right. If it were easier to switch the type of cannon shot, this would be a snap, but the game only has one attack button. It uses the L2 and R2 buttons to spin a small onscreen weapon-select wheel, and by the time you get anywhere in the game, you\'ve picked up enough other (stylistically cool, but less effective) weapons that the two types of cannon shots are several clicks away. Most people will just settle on one type of shot and spend a lot of time bearing down on the enemy, firing off a few misses, taking a long time to turn around, and making another pass. Oddly, the enemy AI seems to freak out sometimes and drive its ships into the shore, leaving them easy targets, stationary, with their guns pointed away from you. Weird. <P>After a bit of time, the initial novelty of the game\'s look and design dulls slightly, as the shortcomings of the combat interface become more apparent. Sure, the later levels have amazing new looks. Storm clouds gather, the world falls into twilight, and you pick up a strange new weapon that allows you to hurl lightning. But the essentials of the game remain the same throughout, making it great for an arcade-style afternoon or two but without any big payoffs for your long-term dedication. --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling,,['PS1'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['The most realistic bowling simulation available Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling features the best known license in the sport including all of its personalities tournaments state-of-the-art equipment and family fun. Choose from among 13 of your favorite Brunswick Pro Staff bowlers and hit the lanes in a true 3D simulation utilizing the most advanced physics engines to date for unsurpassed realism in and pin action. Based on actual Brunswick tournaments Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling boasts authentic tournament rules equipment and structures including the brand new Brunswick Bowling Skins Game!', ""Bowling. A sport that depends more on talent and raw wrist power than actual physical conditioning. A sport that can be so laid back that there's even a section of it that involves buying beer. While THQ can't bring you a six-pack should you throw a strike on the seventh frame, it does manage to deliver an extremely realistic bowling title, complete with some of the best big-money bowlers in the world today. <P>To start, you can create your own bowler or simply choose one of the 13 Brunswick Pro Staff bowlers in the game. Each bowler has a little video clip (similar to THQ's wrestling game, WCW Nitro) that proclaims how much of a badass he is. These clips provide the most hilarious gaming moments in recent memory. Each video is chock-full of bad reads, funny-looking bowler types, and poorly conveyed braggadocio. <P>There are a few different gameplay modes to choose from. Exhibition games get you going quickly, with no strings attached. Just pick a bowler and get on with it. Other modes include the skins game, the tournament, career mode, and cosmic bowling, which turns the lanes into a discotheque. The lane is realistically oiled, which forces you to move around the lane and vary your rolls as conditions change, but this doesn't really make the game terribly hard. Expect to bowl around 150 within your first two games. <P>The graphics are much more than you'd expect from a bowling game. There are tons of different camera angles, which are automatically selected on each roll of the ball. The players look like their real-life counterparts and are fairly well animated. The music in Brunswick is surprisingly good. The music changes on each frame. The sound effects are also very well done. <P>All in all, Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling is a pretty good game. It isn't the type of game you'll play every day, unless you're some kind of bowling nut. Those of you still clinging to Ten Pin Alley can move up to the big leagues with this one. Even if you aren't a bowling fan, and couldn't care less about this game, you really should see the video clips at least once. They're incredibly funny. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

C: Contra Adventure,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Having sold nearly four million units since the game's introduction in 1987 the Contra series has become synonymous with blast-a-minute fun that puts the gamers' strategy and shooting skills to the ultimate test. This all-new 3D version brings consumers a fresh scenario set in a beautifully textured polygonal world. Nine powerful weapons including the popular Shatter-gun and over ten intense stages combine to offer a thrill-packed experience."", ""After the last Contra game, which in case you've blocked it from your memory was a terrible failure, you'd think that Konami would have the sense to put together a decent follow-up in an attempt to right its past wrongs. But this is not the case. Appaloosa Interactive has managed to develop a game that, in some ways, is even worse than Legacy of War. The game is played from two perspectives. The first is an attempt to return to the side-scrolling ways of old-school Contra. The camera occasionally does some funny stuff to make it seem 3D, much like Pandemonium. The other mode is a top-down perspective similar to Legacy of War. The game's weaponry lacks any significant punch, partially due to the terrible sound effects, but the shots also don't look very impressive. The spread gun is still effective but doesn't look or sound as fearsome as it should. The graphics in the game are just plain bad. From the opening title screen, that looks like it came from a fourth-grade art class, to the blocky polygonal characters and ugly sprite-based explosions, nothing looks good. The music sounds like the guy that makes all the music for the Charlie Brown specials was told to write war tunes, and the shots, screams, and explosions that make up the effects are all very drab. Most of the game's levels are played from the top-down perspective, which, unfortunately, is the weaker of the two perspectives. Of course, the side-scrolling levels aren't exactly great, either. So what you're left with is a bad shooter that doesn't even resemble a Contra game most of the time. You can hold multiple weapons and take more than one hit before dying, and you also have smart bombs. It's hard to believe that Konami would release yet another sorry game with the Contra name on it. You would think it would have learned from Legacy of War and put more effort into the next game. If you want to play a good Contra game, pull out your NES or SNES. There's really nothing in this game worth checking out.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Jagged Alliance 2 - PC,,['WINDOWS 98 2000 ME XP VISTA WIN7 WIN8'],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Much like the original <I>Jagged Alliance</I> before it, <I>Jagged Alliance 2</I> offers a tremendous mix of strategy and role-playing. Players take charge of a team of mercenaries and attempt to rid the fictional island Arulco of its tyrannical dictator. After recruiting your team from a vast and often entertaining corps of mercenaries (each with his or her own unique personality and verbal quips), you create a merc to represent yourself in the game and then hit the beach on Arulco.', 'The game play is much like the original <i>Jagged Alliance</i> and the earlier <i>X-COM</i> games from Microprose. You control the action from an overhead, isometric angle and move your troops about in real time until an enemy is spotted. At that point, the game shifts into a turn-based mode, where everyone moves and fires their weapons by spending action points. Though the pace is slower and more deliberate than real-time strategy games, the turn-based mode also allows for more tactical planning, and works exceedingly well in this game.', 'You move through the game by clearing the bad guys from each individual sector of Arulco. As you do, the support of the people grows and you can then recruit and train militia to support your cause. Combined with the need to find a source of income to finance replacement mercs and additional equipment, your to-do list for <I>Jagged Alliance 2</I> becomes quite full.', ""With a solid story, a great array of entertaining mercenaries, addictive game play, and enormous depth, <I>Jagged Alliance 2</I> is an excellent all-around package. It can be extraordinarily difficult as you near the end of the campaign, but aside from that, it's tough to find fault in this game. --<i>Michael E. Ryan</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>The unique personalities of the mercenaries <li>Addictive blend of strategy and role-playing <li>Nonlinear game with lots of depth </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Graphics could use improvement <li>No multiplayer support <li>Extremely difficult toward the end </ul>', 'Like X-COM: UFO Defense before it, the original Jagged Alliance was a complex turn-based strategy game that gained a loyal following almost entirely through positive word of mouth. Yet while X-COM had you commanding squads of marines against alien invaders, Jagged Alliance, as its name suggests, put you in charge of a bunch of ragtag mercenaries, many of whom had their own agendas and wouldn\'t always follow orders. Sirtech followed up with Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games, a pseudo-sequel that included more single-player missions (though no real campaign) and multiplayer options, but it was disappointing when compared with the excellent original. Now, after months in publisher limbo, Jagged Alliance 2 is finally here. And, for the most part, it\'s excellent. <P> As in the first game, you have been hired to liberate a small country from the machinations of a tyrannical ruler. To do this, you must use your small initial funds to build a team of mercenaries whom you send to the country in question. You must recapture it zone by zone and in the process find a means of earning money to hire more mercs and buy better equipment. The hiring/buying process is all done through a well-implemented in-game version of e-mail and the World Wide Web, letting you hire trained killers and purchase heavy explosives much like you\'d buy more common products at any online retailer. <P> Much like the original, the dozens of unique mercenaries of Jagged Alliance 2 are the highlight of the game. Each merc has significant strengths and weaknesses. The stronger and more numerous the strengths, the more money the merc costs (though you can get discounts for paying them for a week or two up front). The mercs each have distinct personalities, and much of the fun in the game comes from hearing what they have to say in certain situations. While the Schwarzenegger-esque Steroid may cry out ""My skin is punctured and leaking!"" after receiving a nasty wound, the tough-as-nails Shadow will only worry that his blood is leaving a trail. The mercs also respond to one another, and many will balk if you hire someone they particularly dislike, and some may be less inclined to work for you if members of your team get killed. <P> Fans of the original will be glad to know that most of the original mercs are back, and some of those that seem strangely absent from the roster make appearances in some form or another over the course of the game. <P> Thankfully, guiding your mercs in action is as much fun as listening to them. The turn-based combat system in Jagged Alliance 2 is excellent, including some welcome improvements over the first game. Each turn, your mercs are allocated a certain number of action points, which can be used to perform any action, such as moving, bandaging, using a weapon, or opening a door. When aiming at an enemy, not only can you target the head, torso, or legs, but you can also allocate more points to each shot, making your merc aim more precisely. When moving, mercs can crawl, crouch, or stand, and a new stealth mode lets them move almost silently, though more slowly. Mercs can also climb onto rooftops, making for some excellent sniping opportunities. Another significant improvement is that the game switches to real time when there are no enemies in sight, letting you reposition your team quickly for the next firefight. <P> Gunshots are simulated precisely, even to the extent that bullets will sometimes ricochet or penetrate obstacles and still cause damage to the intended target, albeit much less than usual. And while your mercs\' ability to absorb damage may be a bit unrealistic (how many point-blank head shots can one person really stand?), it certainly makes the game more playable. <P> Jagged Alliance 2 deviates from the original in its campaign structure. While the map is still divided into zones, you no longer simply move and fight on a zone-by-zone basis. Towns are your primary targets, and you must take and hold these while training a militia to protect them while you are away. Zones between towns contain wandering troops of enemies, and you have the option of retreating, fighting, or having the computer resolve the combat situation for you when you encounter resistance (though the latter almost always leads to unnecessary loss of life). Your team can also find and employ vehicles, from hummers to helicopters, expediting travel between zones. <P> And no longer will you have to halt your attack simply because night has fallen - you can now engage in combat during day or night, though you must make sure your team gets plenty of rest. The map is full of strange and unexpected encounters and at times resembles Interplay\'s role-playing game Fallout more than X-COM. You\'ll even encounter nonplayer characters to converse with, and often they\'ll ask you to undertake missions from escorting them to safety, to rescuing their imprisoned comrades. <P> Visually, Jagged Alliance 2 resembles Fallout as well, with smoothly animated 2D sprites and similarly barren landscapes. Oftentimes the scenery becomes repetitive, although things liven up as you press into the wealthier regions of Arulco. There is a wide variety of character animations, and these are excellent, though the most common death animation (drop to knees, drop to ground) occurs too frequently. Sonically speaking, though, Jagged Alliance 2 is nearly perfect. The mercenaries\' voices are excellent (and if you find any particular merc annoying, you can mute him individually), and the soundtrack is suitably dramatic. <P> Its many strengths make Jagged Alliance 2\'s occasional but noticeable weaknesses especially frustrating. The most notable problem is the manner in which line of sight is implemented in combat: The game uses a realistic line-of-sight system, with elevation and objects serving to affect your mercenaries and their targets. Unfortunately, there is no tangible way to determine the visible range for a mercenary. The isometric view tends to make some terrain objects almost invisible (it\'s difficult, for instance, to see each individual trunk in a cluster of trees), so you may think a merc is protected by cover when, in truth, he is in plain view. Predictably enough, your enemies do not suffer this human handicap and seem to know just where to stand for maximum protection. There are any number of ways the developers could have made this information apparent (through a fog of war or something akin to Commandos\' sweeping sight indicator, for example), and its lack is a notable oversight. <P> The addition of more role-playing elements is welcome, but many of these features seem underdeveloped. When speaking with NPCs, for example, you simply choose your attitude toward them (friendly, direct, or threatening). Different people will respond to different attitudes, but it\'s difficult to really guess how to act with whom. Moreover, you only get one chance, so once they decide the conversation is over, the conversation is over. You never can be certain whether they held some valuable information you couldn\'t extract or whether they just had nothing important to say. <P> Jagged Alliance 2 also retains one of its predecessor\'s biggest faults: The endgame is ridiculously difficult. The original contained a final combat zone that was far more challenging than any that preceded it. The sequel is no different, save for the fact that instead of a single zone, its ending is made up of five such areas. Jagged Alliance 2 does include three difficulty settings, but you cannot change difficulty in mid-game, which means you may become hopelessly stuck toward the end. <P> Beyond just the difficulty level, Jagged Alliance 2 lets you set other key variables as well. You can toggle the science fiction elements off (a choice that only affects a small subplot of the game), and you can choose either ""normal guns"" or ""tons of guns,"" the latter adding a selection of Warsaw Pact weapons and two additional ammo types. <P> Add to these options the wide variety of mercs, the numerous nonplayer character conversations, and the random nature of encounters, and it\'s quite likely that you\'ll eagerly play through Jagged Alliance 2 several times, provided you can get through the grueling endgame. Even with its problems, its excellent combat system and sense of style make Jagged Alliance 2 very easy to recommend.<i>--Ron Dulin</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

WCW vs. NWO: WorldTour,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['Who will win this battle royale the legendary WCW or the upstart new World order. Up to four players can choose their favorite superstar wrestler in a down and dirty rumble match.', 'WCW vs. NWO features tons of licensed wrestlers for the WCW enthusiast, with dozens of special moves. If you\'ve just got to fight Hollywood Hogan against Rey Mysterio Jr., you can - although they still call him ""Hulk"" in the setup screens despite Mr. Hogan\'s newer, sleeker, blacker look. Unfortunately the game is flawed with sluggish control and play mechanics. However, the list of pile drivers, body slams, sleeper holds - hell, the sheer number of submissions in general - is long enough to make it worth checking out. Plus, the game is blessed with a battle royal mode that may be the best comedy dollar spent on the N64. <P>Control is unresponsive and sluggish. A sense of timing is required not only to find holes in your opponent\'s defenses, but also to find the points at which the Nintendo 64 will allow you to perform moves at all. Run at your opponent and push the attack button and watch as your wrestler performs a flying kick - in the wrong direction. For the bulk of the game, the analog stick is only employed for special moves and grandstanding. The remainder of control is performed with the standard D-pad. Collision detection is sketchy at best. A punch will connect in one instance, but move one centimeter closer and attempt the same punch, and watch as your wrestler\'s hand moves right across your opponent\'s face and doesn\'t connect.  <P>The animations of the individual wrestlers are pretty solid. The use of multiple or rotating camera angles during pins, holds, and special moves is a nice touch also. There is a fair amount of pop-up when the depth of field allows for the ropes to enter the view, but its effect on the overall feel is minimal. The animation of the crowd is a downright surreal blur of horrific shades of mauve, gray, and pale blue that somehow makes the ring seem to exist somewhere in Dante\'s Inferno rather than on pay-per-view. Very odd.  <P>The AI is fairly competent, if a little random at times. It can hold its own against a novice player, but once you get used to the control it\'s easy to beat. It also exhibits a strange tendency to block or duck when neither is appropriate. WCW vs. NWO is much better as a multiplayer game. Maybe it\'s the license, or maybe it\'s the capacity to grab foreign objects from outside the ring, or throw opponents from it, but this game brings out the best and worst in human competitors.  <P>Options include tag team play, season play, and round robin tournaments, but it\'s the battle royal, with four wrestlers in the ring - all the time - that really takes the cake. One word sums it up: shenanigans. With one to four human players and the CPU controlling the rest, battle royal is wild and crazy - and absolutely hilarious. It\'s so, well, downright silly, to have four people in the ring at once. The sheer number of onscreen bodies makes any time the right time for a flying leap from the turnbuckle.  <P>With its ups and downs, you may want to rent WCW vs. NWO before purchasing it. Fans of the real-life WCW may find the treatment of the license not realistic enough for their liking. The characters\' moves and appearances aren\'t very accurate, making the license appear like it was slapped on at the last minute. Control issues and poor collision detection aside, though, the battle royal mode is one of the strangest things going for the N64.  --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Show your friends how cool you are by perfoming killer moves and imposssible tricks. Choose from 10 characters each with their own unique attributes and styles. You can even pick from tons of snow boards with specific ratings or you can create your own monster board.

What does it all mean? It means that Sony\'s Cool Boarders 2 is an awesome snowboarding game and one of the best trick/stunt racing games since Uniracers for the Super Nintendo. It\'s also one of the most difficult. <P>You have your choice of five play modes. Freestyle mode sends you down a long track with tight turns, narrow passages, and a handful of jumps. Scoring is based on time, number of wipeouts, and tricks performed on the jumps. Halfpipe mode is one giant (you guessed it) halfpipe, allowing for dozens of attempts at pulling off the perfect alley-oop crippler 720. Scoring is entirely based on tricks. The Big Air mode is essentially like a ski jump with just one chance to go for maximum distance and rotation as well as throwing in as many grabs as you can before hitting the ground. In Competition mode, you perform against As or other players in split-screen mode through the three previous modes. Finally, the relaxing Board Park mode is unscored, with play similar to that of Freestyle mode, only with a much mellower track. <P>Control is incredibly difficult to master in Cool Boarders 2. Even a simple 180 involves getting up to speed and pointing at the correct angle if there\'s any kind of lip involved, holding the D-pad left or right, then pressing and holding the X-button, and finally releasing the button before the D-pad. Timing is essential. The longer you hold the two down, the more spin you get. If you add any interesting grabs, you must release them before touching down again, or you\'ll wipe out. Halfpipe mode is great for learning how to control the board as well as for learning tricks, since it has no obstacles and plenty of lip for jumping. Don\'t even think about racing down the Freestyle tracks before you\'ve mastered a few moves. Otherwise, the occasional jumps will only frustrate you, and you won\'t catch any air. Once you\'ve got a handle on dropping back in, you\'ll really start to enjoy the freedom the game provides. Huge hang times, 1080 degree spins with flips, and grabs that drastically alter your aerodynamics all combine to make flight over the alpine tree tops really feel like soaring.  <P>Though the ""boarders"" themselves are choppy looking and suffer from a fair share of polygon dropout, the animations of the various tricks are quite smooth. Sometimes their smoothness is exaggerated, allowing for slow, lilting rotating tail grabs and extremely gradual backflips. These feel and look great and are a rewarding payoff for the 90 minutes most of the tricks take to learn. Many of the backgrounds are pretty sketchy looking, and the courses often have regularly spaced visible seams between the track\'s textures.  <P>With its many modes of play and dozens of moves to master, Cool Boarders 2 is much better than the original. The simplicity of the Halfpipe mode alone is extremely addicting and offers hours of challenging ""drops."" Even if you dislike racing games or wince at the word ""extreme,"" Cool Boarders 2 is recommended, especially to fans of other combo-driven gaming styles. --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

NBA Live 97,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Cartridge only. Cartridge and/or label will show some wear, including discoloration, tearing, writing, or other cosmetic issues. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', 'Boasting lightning-fast gameplay, tons of moves, great artificial intelligence, textured polygon players, and motion capture animation, NBA Live 97 may very well be the best Playstation-based basketball game to date. Featuring all 29 NBA Teams plus two all-star teams (each team has 12 active roster slots plus injured reserve), over 300 real NBA players, including rookies on updated rosters, exhibition, season, and playoff modes, NBA Live 97 has it all. <P>The animations are so smooth and realistic that you\'d swear you were watching a real game. With all-new offensive and defensive plays, which all can be programmed and changed on the fly, players perform hard-hitting slams, fade away shots, graceful tip-ins, finger rolls, and even behind-the-back passes. And when a player gets knocked down, he actually pushes himself up off the floor and shakes his head as he recovers. This realistic action comes to the Playstation via the athletic prowess of Sacramento Kings stars Mitch Richmond and Tyrus Edney through the use of motion capture technology. The players tend to be on the small side, however, but the trade-off for larger players is slower performance. EA also includes eight different camera configurations, allowing players to customize highlights and close-ups. Capping off the package are animated play diagrams, individual defensive pressure options, track stats for a whole season, and the ability to save records to memory cards. <P>It\'s worth noting that NBA Live 97\'s roster even includes Shaquille O\'Neal, making it the only console-based basketball game that currently makes his likeness available. And players who want to live out the fantasy of going up against the superstars can create an alter-ego that bears the name and number of their choosing on the back of the jersey. <P>The sound effects are also topnotch. Everything from the squeaking sneakers on the court to the swish of the net are all very authentic, and even the music played during the game provides that in-the-arena feel. TNT\'s participation in creating this title means that its logos festoon the game, and Ernie Johnson Jr. is the network announcer. TNT\'s involvement also means a 30 second half-time show for each team, complete with live video. <P>The graphics, sound, gameplay, and numerous features are enough to satisfy hoop fans and die-hard sports gamers.

F-1 World Grand Prix,,['F1 Racing'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['includes cartridge and hard collector case with reprint of original case artwork. rental sticker on back', ""Most console-based racing simulations are yawn-inducing efforts that prove to be a huge waste of time. F-1 World Grand Prix proves an exception to the rule. This is an intricate yet highly playable game, one that will please not only F-1 fans, but anyone seeking an N64 racer with long-term depth and replayability comparable to - if not quite the equal of - the PlayStation hit Gran Turismo. Let's start with what you get, which in a word, is a lot. F-1 offers 17 tracks, 22 drivers, five modes of play (including two-player split screen), and five different camera angles that substantially alter the gaming experience. If my math is correct, that means there are more than 18,000 different combinations for you to explore. You could play this game from now until all F-1 cars run on solar power because the earth's supply of fossil fuels has been exhausted, and still not see everything the game has to offer. And that's before you factor in all the various ways you can tweak your car's performance. There are eight different adjustments (rear wing, brakes, tires, etc.), and each has a meaningful impact on your car's handling and performance characteristics. This sort of modification setup is nothing new, but F-1's system is among the most user-friendly we've seen. What's especially nice is that the game includes a number of pre-configured-settings packages, which allow you to easily modify your car without dealing with the individual parts, meaning you can spend less time in the shop and more time on the track. That's a good thing, because in F-1, the track is the place to be. Few console racing games - and certainly none on the N64 - can approach the realism of F-1's physics and handling models. Based on your input, turns are made, traction is lost, and accidents happen - all with unswerving (and occasionally unnerving) accuracy and consistency. There are no tricks here, no shortcuts to glory. You have to be smart, you have to be conservative, and you definitely have to be cool under pressure. It isn't easy. As a matter of fact, for the first few hours or even days you play F-1, you may have a hard time just staying on the track. That makes F-1 a poor choice for rental, because by the time you get the hang of it, the weekend will be over. But if you stick with it, you will be rewarded with an immensely satisfying and challenging game. Master F-1's intricate braking and turning techniques, and shift your focus to the larger, more strategic elements of the race, and F-1 becomes one of the most engrossing games yet on the N64. Experienced F-1 players find themselves in a trance-like state, as lap after blistering lap goes by without incident, until suddenly, the opportunity to make a move presents itself, and in a split second is either realized or lost. The only thing that breaks this magic spell is an occasional graphical glitch. Don't get me wrong - F-1's graphics are generally good and occasionally dazzling, with nice details including fog and rain effects, lens flares, fatigable terrain, and vivid lifelike textures. But - and this is a big but - the frame rate is not consistent, and at least a couple times every lap, it drops below acceptable standards. Most of the problems seem to occur at the car's performance limit - that is, just before, during, or after a spin. Of course, this is the worst possible time to have the screen start jerking around - it's tough enough to recover from trouble without the added challenge of not being able to see what's happening around you. The frame rate glitch also has a side effect, which is that it sometimes seems to propel your car forward on the track, so that you actually benefit from having gone into a spin. It doesn't happen all the time, but if you're a perfectionist, it may be enough of an issue to seriously impair your enjoyment of the game. Another issue is the game's sound, which, depending on your level of tolerance, is either mediocre or borderline annoying. The whine of an F-1 engine - which besides the occasional color commentary is really the only major audio element in the game - isn't the most pleasant sound in the world, and listening to it for extended periods of time becomes a real drag. (I think most F-1 car drivers wear earplugs - and now I understand why).  But for me, the frame rate problem and lackluster sounds are not enough to mar what is otherwise an excellent racing sim. If you're looking for something more than just another arcade racer, and if you're willing to invest some time learning how to play, F-1 World Grand Prix deserves your serious consideration.  <I>--Vince Broady </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Virtual Pool 64 - Nintendo 64,,['N64'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The ultra real physics make Virtual Pool 64 as close to the real thing as it gets. Three difficulty levels nine pool types and amazing trick shots will keep you coming back for more. Designed for control stick analog rumble pak and controller pak.', 'While some students major in philosophy, and others in physics, there probably aren\'t many who go to college to get a degree in pool sharking. Well, if any institute for higher education were crazy enough to start such a program, its professors would do well to invest in Virtual Pool 64 as a multimedia teaching aid. While this game lacks extras found in other titles, it has a solid graphics/gameplay engine as close to the real thing as you\'ll find anywhere. <P>This title comes packed with nine game types to choose from: 3-Ball, 6-Ball, 8-Ball, 9-Ball, 10-Ball, Rotation Pool, Straight Pool, Bank Pool, and One Pocket. You can use these games to run tournaments, practice, or play a single match. For those who\'d rather make their own rules, there\'s a free-style mode. In addition, a shark-skins mode requires you to clear a table of three, six, and finally nine balls in the fewest strokes possible. Suffice it to say, there\'s enough variety to satisfy virtually every player\'s needs. <P>In terms of control, all the buttons on the controller are put to use - a surprise for a pool game. The analog control used to measure the power behind a stroke works extremely well, although it\'s rather easy to put too much juice into a stroke and send a ball flying off the table. Fortunately, all the analog sensitivity and button configurations are fully adjustable, so control is not a concern. <P>Visually, the presentation of the pool table and balls is excellent. Even at the maximum zoom, the balls don\'t break up or reveal jaggy edges. Thanks to the N64\'s processing power, the game\'s practice mode has an option to ""see"" the projected paths of every hit ball on the table, which is a great way for learning how to calculate the right angle to sink a ball. On the minus side, the pool hall backgrounds are severely bland and not rendered to the same standard. Also, the less-than-inspiring music sounds straight out of a low-budget skin flick and should be turned off at the first possible moment. <P>But for all of Virtual Pool 64\'s realism and features, it still comes up lacking because the game offers no incentive to play other than for love of the game. One can only beat ""John Q. Balls"" and other faceless cheesy-name opponents so many times before the fun wears thin. This game lacks opponents with personalities and deep pockets for betting (Pool Hustler), as well as an engaging story mode that gives players a ""quest"" as incentive to keep playing (Backstreet Billiards). It also lacks any dedicated modes to test skills specifically on trick shots, which seems rather odd considering that it\'s a staple in other pool games. <P>Virtual Pool comes off as a top-notch simulation but a boring game. It\'s the video game equivalent of a college textbook: great to learn from but not really exciting to read. For anyone wanting to learn more about pool table physics - ball aiming, angles, and so forth - to help them with their real-life skills, this game is a sure-fire choice. It\'s also a great choice for anyone looking for a great-looking multiplayer pool game. Still, if this title had a little more personality and ""fun"" extras, it probably would\'ve gotten a much better score. --Nelson Taruc <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

The road to the National Championship.', ""Why does it seem so damn hard to program a sound football AI? Arguably, there's never been a football game in which you couldn't find that gaping hole and drive your team right through it like a Mack truck, over and over again. You should be happy to hear that NCAA Football 99 is not one of those games. OK, there are few things you can exploit quite a bit, but play balancing is more to blame than AI. <P>Now, you might think football games are boring if you can't easily score close to 100 points per game. Fine, play NCAA Football 99 at the easiest junior varsity difficulty level and score all you like. But play it at the varsity level or especially the all-American level and you won't be completing bombs every time (just sometimes). In fact, computer opponents can be downright challenging. And if that team is considered one of your school's rivals, they seem to play even better. <P>When you're on offense, what you really have to watch out for are most teams' defensive ends. They usually have little trouble getting around your slower linemen who are trying to pass-block  them. Ah-ha! That should be a hint to you when you're playing defense. If the computer is lined up in a typical two back, two wideout formation, take control of the weak-side defensive end (the one lined up to the outside of the weak-side tackle) and get ready to pounce on the quarterback. You might need to make a swim move, but usually you can get an unabated run at the quarterback. One of my defensive ends amassed 44 sacks and 71 tackles in the regular season! That's ridiculous. The next defensive player closest to him (besides the other DE on my team) had six sacks. <P>Fast linebackers are also a major nuisance. It's nearly impossible to run the ball outside if your opponent has them; and double trouble if they also have quick ends. Even if you have a speedy running back, you can't seem to get around the corner and turn upfield. (You can still have your usual share of success running up the middle, however.) Similarly, if you have speedy linebackers on your team, your opponent won't be able to run the ball outside on you either. <P>And that brings up a great aspect about NCAA Football 99: You can try to play the same way against every team you face, but there's a good chance you won't succeed. That means you actually have to make up a game plan by analyzing your next opponent's team, which is good. What's bad is player attributes (not game or season stats) are really inaccessible. The only way I could find to see attributes was from the Reorder Roster screen. You can also just start playing the game and see what kind of plays work, then keep using them. <P>Another great feature in the game is the dynasty mode, which is similar to season mode, except you're more like a newly hired coach with a five-year contract. Depending on the program you take over, there'll be constant pressure on you to win. When it comes time to recruit players, you can assign members of your coaching staff, including yourself, to recruit for certain positions. Obviously, your best chance at signing a blue chipper is if you send yourself, but you can still bag a budding young star otherwise. <P>NCAA Football 99 also has the full list of standard features, including a practice field and even a play and playbook editor. It's a pretty complete game and one that should satisfy just about any college football fan. --Tasos Kaiafas <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

However, it doesn\'t deliver the blood of Mortal Kombat, the body count of Loaded, or the rampant annihilation of innocents of Die Hard Trilogy. Adding insult to injury, Project Overkill also fails to deliver the over-the-top gameplay and excitement found in those titles. While Project Overkill does indeed feature plenty of shooting and dying, players will get that gnawing been-there, done-that feeling after just a few minutes of action. <P>The four mercenaries in Project Overkill don\'t offer the range of personalities found in Loaded. They seem like clones of each other, moving and shooting in decidedly similar ways. The few villain animations are raw (who, when hit, all ""splat"" the same way), and the stark background walls have awful, pale color schemes. Even the player\'s character animations are sparse. In fact, the graphics in Project Overkill are so basic that this game could have easily been released on a 16-bit system and not have suffered. <P>The gameplay is pretty basic, too. Players are tasked with running around a series of levels, using a variety of weapons to shoot bad guys, and acquiring power-ups or keys. In this regard, Project Overkill is a Loaded-clone, but with a closer, three-quarter view, instead of overhead (walls disappear a la Die Hard, but not as conveniently; and hidden items behind them force perimeter checks). The player\'s character can shoot in only eight directions, making sweeps impossible. These blind spots give enemies plenty of room to maneuver, and it\'s easy to run out of ammo trying to line up a shot. Secret rooms do exist in Project Overkill, but seeking them out is not much of an incentive to slog through the bland, boring levels. <P>Loaded freaks willing to settle for a substandard imitation while waiting for a sequel will undoubtedly give Project Overkill a whirl.

Allied General,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""It's 1944 and Allies are prepared to launch their attack against Germany. The only question is where should the allies land troops? You have been choosen to be the general of the Allied forces. Command the Allied forces across all of Europe in a series of campaigns against the Axis powers. Watch your troops improve with each victory as you push the Germans all the way back to Berlin."", 'Allied General is a true onscreen wargame in the Avalon Hill sense of the word, complete with hexes, zones of control, attack/defense factors, movement points, and stacked units. Players assume the role of an Allied or Axis commander in strategic-level WWII operations in three campaigns, which means Playstation owners can now experience desert clashes with Rommel\'s Afrika Korps forces; the expected Soviet and American operations in Europe; a number of hypothetical alternate-history campaigns (such as Winston Churchill\'s speculative and slightly wonko Operation Jupiter, a talked-but-never-walked invasion of Norway); and over 35 individual scenarios. <P>The term ""Armchair General"" was coined for this kind of game. Being a serious wargame effort, rather than an action title, Allied General is played in turns. The turn scheme means that each action must be carefully considered - Allied forces make the moves they can, attack viable targets, collect replacement forces, or perform other special functions. The process is then repeated with the Axis forces. Certain objectives, such as the capture of a city, or the destruction of a certain portion of the enemy, must sometimes be completed within a fixed number of turns - changing what might otherwise be tactically simple circumstances into deliberate, squinty-eyed races against time, deployment, terrain or - more likely - all of them combined. <P>Once each unit\'s attacks have been designated, the player is presented with generalized, close-up animations showing the results of combat in terms of actual losses - groups of infantry suddenly reduced by half, surface cruisers taking hits or dishing them out, and so on. Allied General can be played as a human-vs.-computer game (be prepared not to leave the house for days), or as a two-player contest. But the proposed two players should be reasonably patient and very determined - and not mind the inevitable, nasty bouts of waiting while the enemy player carefully plans and re-plans his moves.  <P>Unfortunately, the combat animations are essentially worthless, a glaring flaw in an otherwise serious game. True wargames are known for their seriousness and depth (not their bells and whistles), and Allied General\'s minimal, choppy, fire-exchange-and-casualty affairs are worthy of an 8-bit system. Players will undoubtedly turn this feature off and quickly forget about it. <P>For the average gamer, the proposition of a wargame of this depth being translated to the consoles may be a little daunting. They may be better served with the upcoming Command & Conquer. However, those war-weary, hex-war veterans, who found some of MicroProse\'s PC titles just a tad slick or even thin, should find Allied General to be the right speed and weight. --Chris Hudak <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

An underground terrorist organization has  seized control of Hawaii and brought the nation down on its knees  (snicker), requiring the player to save the day by successfully  completing 25 missions using four types of aircraft. The missions are  played out in consecutive order--with video newscasts in between to  provide story details--and can be replayed to improve performance or to  seek out the game's 10 hidden stunt bonuses, which reward fancy flying  with a fifth playable fighter plane and a secret mission. The game also  features a two-player split-screen mode that comes in two flavors,  cooperative play and head to head."", 'The gameplay in <i>Eagle One: Harrier Attack</i> is solid, with simple  controls and a well-designed training mode that does an especially good  job of acclimating gamers to the hover mode of the Harrier and rescue  helicopter. In addition to being able to play from a first- or third- person viewpoint, players can manipulate an external camera view to get  a better (or different) look at things around the aircraft when the  game is paused; replays can be watched in the same fashion. <i>--Joe  Hon</i>', '<b>Pros:</b>  <ul> <li> Fun and challenging air combat <li> Hover mode of Harrier and rescue helicopter adds gameplay variety <li> Stunt bonuses add additional mission replay value and unlock  secrets <li> Language selection of American English, Spanish, and French </ul>', '<b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li> Unremarkable 3-D graphics <li> More suited to hard-core fighter-simulation fans than casual  gamers </ul>', 'Eagle One: Harrier Attack tells a grim tale: A group of terrorists, armed with remnants of Soviet military technology, have launched an attack on US soil. With Hawaii as its launch point, the so-called Army of the New Millennium (ANM, for short) intends to accomplish nothing short of ""freeing the world from the grasp of the American war machine."" A lofty goal, to be sure, and one definitely not beyond the group\'s means: To facilitate its acquisition of the islands, ANM has employed an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapon. An EMP of sufficient power is capable of rendering any electrical device - from microwaves to computer networks - totally and completely useless. A scary thought, no doubt, but one that is eerily possible. At any rate, ANM used an EMP to effectively paralyze civilization on the islands of Hawaii, and, wasting no time, moved on in with an ex-Soviet aircraft carrier, making its intentions of world domination (liberation?) crystal clear.   You, in the shoes of a crack US Marine pilot, are to put an end to this madness. Initially equipped with a drool-demanding Harrier Jumpjet, you must wade your way through 25 levels of not-so-typical flight-sim fare in order to vanquish the brutal ANM and reclaim Hawaii for good \'ole Uncle Sam.  To quote the instruction manual, Eagle One has ""four modes of play: a one-player mode, two two-player modes, and a training-mode."" The single-player mode runs you through the 25 missions, which are equally and cleverly dispersed through Hawaii\'s five islands. Your actual base of operations changes every five levels, which makes for some decent scenic variety. The two-player modes consist of a straight-up dogfight mode and a couple of co-op levels, which could actually have been kind of cool, if not for the game\'s mechanical problems. The training-mode schools you in the subtle art of Harrier-piloting, and it comes complete with the requisite foul-mouthed, hard-assed drill sergeant voice-work. Taking place in the Navy Flight School, this feature is not to be missed, as making the Harrier play nice requires quite a bit of getting used to, mostly due to a nonintuitive control scheme.  The 25 missions are freshly varied. Indeed, Glass Ghost has done digital justice to myriad capabilities of the Harrier Jumpjet. Instead of throwing you high up into the wild blue, Eagle One keeps most of the action down low, with the Harrier usually flying at altitudes under 100 feet. What\'s there to do down that low? Many things: bombard enemy convoys, rescue downed pilots, and take out panicked, infected terrorists before they can reach and contaminate the civilian population, among other things. All the while, of course, you\'ll be exchanging shells with enemies on all points of the axis, from refurbished Migs, to platoon upon platoon of tanks. All this sounds like great fun, doubtlessly, and it totally would have been, if not for the game\'s few (but serious) problems. First off, the control scheme will have one\'s fingers in knots. As the Harrier (the plane you\'ll use, primarily) has two flight modes - ""jet"" and ""hover."" The control scheme alters slightly for each. Applying the throttle in jet mode causes the Harrier to accelerate, while in hover mode, it\'ll cause it to gain altitude. Same principle applies to releasing throttle - slowdown in jet-mode, drop altitude in hover. With no dedicated means of accelerating while in hover mode, you\'re left to weakly squirm around in the air, moving at a pace resembling that of a ten-ton kite. And since many missions require you to precisely maneuver around in low altitudes (something extremely difficult to do in jet mode), this is, needless to say, extremely frustrating. While considering the physics and actual nature of the Harrier Jumpjet may actually justify this, Glass Ghost should have taken some liberties with reality to produce a more playable game.  Another cause for grief is Eagle One\'s graphics. While they do excel in many areas, certain elements on the ground are just way too indistinct to be able to target effectively. Often times, the only thing signaling a potential target will be a green ring surrounding it, issuing from the HUD. Convoys of trucks, and platoons of tanks look like armies of mottled ants. This would be understandable, if the objects were being viewed from a vantage of several hundred feet, but often times, you\'ve only got dozens of feet on the blotchy, barely visible messes you\'re made to target. When it comes to the environment, depth and distance are well simulated, which makes for some nicely detailed environments, but in the end it all goes down the tubes when combined with the halfhearted effort put forth in creating the very things that inhabit the world.  Soundwise, Eagle One does an average job. But the premission productions, which were made to simulate a series of cut-and-pasted news broadcasts telling the eerie tale of EMPs and ANM, should be noticed, as they are possessed by a particular narrative polish, which the disciplined, sparing use of audio only helps. Aside from this, however, you can expect to hear the typical commander-to-pilot banter, engine noise, and the sounds of things blowing up.  Eagle One does have its problems, but in the end, it\'s not a total loss. One can definitely find some kind of strange solace in its grim, portentous story, and the decent variety of missions. Also, there are a couple of other aircraft that take secondary roles in the game, including an F-15 fighter jet, an A-10 rescue chopper, and a special, secret craft, so you can expect some kind of respite from the down-low type of combat. If you don\'t mind putting up with an initially clunky control scheme, and you aren\'t above dealing with decidedly subpar graphics, then you just might find some fresh flight-sim gameplay in Eagle One: Harrier Attack.<i>--Miguel Lopez</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Contra quickly became a legend, spawning sequels all the way up to Contra 3: The Alien Wars on the SNES."", ""Now Contra enters the 32-bit age with Legacy of War.

The game sports a few good-looking explosions, and in 3-D mode a lot of explosions result in chunks of metal flying towards the screen. It's a nice touch, but nothing spectacular.

This future-sport game has been virtually ignored by enthusiast magazines and by its own distributor, Accolade (which instead frittered away most of its ad bucks on Bubsy 3D and its obnoxious exclamation-point-wearing mascot that hardcore gamers have come to hate). That\'s too bad, because Pitball is superb. <P>Pitball is a two-on-two game of goal-scoring. It takes place in concave arenas located on a dozen planets scattered throughout a fictional galaxy. Each team\'s freaky-looking competitors fight for control of the energized Pitball, employing attack moves both complex (Tekken-esque combinations of button pressing), and simple (a mere tap of the button). Once the Pitball is in hand, the player attempts to shoot it into the goal, a tiny hole at the top of the pit wall. <P>The slightly awkward controls make the speedy gameplay a challenge to master. But once the learning curve flattens out, Pitball is great fun. With fast and weak, or slow and strong, teams to match your style of play, the variety of athletic maneuvers and attacks ensures that every match is exciting. The season mode is fantastic. Using a combination of in-the-pit and behind-the-scenes maneuvering, it allows players to take a team of any of the 12 alien races and guide them from the bottom to the top. It\'s even possible to let the computer play the matches - great for those times when you\'d prefer to rest your callused thumbs and focus on management. <P>On the downside, the graphics are slightly rough. Most of the arenas are pixelated, and the polygonal players don\'t look as good as the dudes and dudettes in Playstation fighting games. And although three views of the action are available, only the farthest is truly playable. The others are too close for anything but nice screenshots. The sound effects and music are outstanding, though the overdone Michael Buffer sound bites quickly become tiresome. <P>Pitball is an excellent game, containing more options and gameplay challenges than most ""real"" sports simulations.

Formula 1 '98 includes full multiplayer options on both PlayStation and there's never been a better chance to rev up and spin some rubber with the world's most glamorous motor sport !"", ""The fourth PlayStation title in Psygnosis' series of Formula 1 sims, Formula 1 98 continues the franchise, adds some new features, refines a few old ones, blows it on a few minor details, and... is still really hard to drive.  <P>Graphically, this is prettier to look at than the last effort. Cars are more solid, with fewer obvious polygon problems. While Formula 1 Championship Edition's cars seemed to vibrate in place, F1 98's are so smooth and even, they almost have a cartoon-like quality. The detailing on the trees is superior to last year's, though the level of pop-up is comparable. There is however a slight but present visual distortion to the track immediately in front of the car. Space appears to be slightly curved around the map portion of the screen. Most irritating is a horizontal crack that appears and disappears sporadically about five feet in front of the car. But the car itself looks great, right down to the treads. There are still no rearview mirrors; Psygnosis cites the need to fully render two images instead of one and the increased overhead's adverse effect on the game's speed - it would slow everything way down - as the reason for this omission. If you press the D-pad down, you switch to a rear view, but in practice this is awkward and not useful in preventing enemy passing. <P>F1 98 handles better than last year's model. Both the arcade or grand prix modes still understeer horrendously, so winning races requires a heavy dose of powersliding, which isn't necessarily appropriate to Formula One racing - I thought these cars were supposed to take turns at very high speeds without batting an eye, but.... It was almost impossible to take the smallest curve without slowing to 30mph in the grand prix mode of last year's offering; this time it's doable. The modes are a little less divergent this time around too. The main difference seems to be the depth of hot water you get into when you start to slide. Recovery is nearly impossible in grand prix mode, with cars hurtling down the track, 90 degrees out of phase. Practically the only time the cars oversteer is when you try to right them once you're in the dirt, which can feel more like punishment than realism as you spin out every which way.  <P>The cars still sound a little weird although less like motorcycles than they did last year. And the all-important commentary? Rest assured, it's still performed by Murray Walker and racing giant Martin Brundle. They've got a wider vocabulary of comment this time around. Unfortunately, it still comes out late or just plain wrong a lot of the time. There's nothing more annoying than getting back on the track just in time to be told you've gone completely off it. And when you're missing an entire wheel, and Mr. Brundle tells Mr. Walker that he thinks he's overestimating the significance of the damage, well, it would be nice if it weresarcasm, but I just don't think it's that smart. Track overviews make a much more useful application of the voice-overs. Looping video of each track is available, from inside the car. It's just like a replay, only Murray Walker's voice guides you through the different pitfalls of the individual track, recommending speeds, brake points, and noting the most troublesome chicanes. Because it's a loop, you can memorize the location of each track's trouble spots before even settling down for a trial run. It's a more productive practice since it's easier to memorize the course when you're spared the trouble of driving. And some of those chicanes are way too small for you to ever see them coming on the map.  Very cool. <P>Ultimately, the Formula 1 series excels as a sim series in a world of arcade racers. Though there is some debate as to just how realistic the various options are, they're all there for you to tweak to your heart's content. Front and rear down-force, tire density, size of brake discs, etc. It's all here. And with F1 98's better handling, it's easier to notice the difference a little tweaking makes. Each of your car setup options can be tweaked in the pit. It's not quite on-the-fly, but it's the next-best thing. Besides, on-the-fly car tweaks wouldn't be realistic, now would they? <P>In the final analysis, Psygnosis has created another fine racing sim. F1 98 is certainly a superior product. Why then do we feel let down? Well, it's just that after so many tries, you've gotta wonder why they can't make it perfect by now. Make a Formula 1 sim that's every bit as realistic as Gran Turismo, every bit as fast as Need for Speed III, and smooth like Automobili Lamborghini. F1 98 is a terrific F1 sim, but time goes on, standards grow higher, and we yearn for something more.  --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

In fact, it's one of the worst baseball games ever released for the platform. The game is inferior to games like Triple Play 2000 and MLB 2000 in every way and doesn't offer anything worth checking out. <P>The game has the standard features and modes of any other baseball game - exhibition, quick play, season, home run challenge, and playoffs. The one unique mode in the game is... family mode. No, you can't make your aunt play third and put your second cousin at short. It just turns on auto fielding and base running, so... uh... the rest of your family can play without actually having to have a brain. <P>The control is sluggish and unresponsive, mostly due to the lengthy throwing animation in the field. And since the game uses the same throwing animation whether you're sending a ball in from the outfield or shuttling the ball over to second from the shortstop, you're always waiting. Compounding this problem is the overall speed of the game. It moves too slowly and is rather unbalanced. For instance, turning double plays is incredibly rare - the ball almost has to be hit directly at a fielder to pull it off. This happens because the speed of the ball travels unrealistically slow in relation to the speed of the players running the bases.  <P>Batting never seems to make sense. You must swing way before the pitch looks like it's near the plate to get a hit, and even when you get the timing down, it doesn't seem to be a consistent way to get base hits. You can't move your batter within the batter's box, so there's no way to chase an outside pitch or get away from an inside one. When you are pitching, it's almost as if you have to fight the pitch to keep it in the strike zone. You select what type of pitch you want to throw and then subtly control the pitch when the ball is on its way. You can use the after touch to try to direct where the ball will end up. It never looks as though it's going to make it to the strike zone, so you have to use the after touch simply to get it there. <P>Graphically, High Heat Baseball 2000 looks quite poor, especially in comparison with other PlayStation ball games like Triple Play 2000 and MLB 2000. The players are made up of simple polygons that give them a very boxy, unrealistic look. These models look even worse, since the player animations aren't all that great and have bad transition between one another. On a positive note, the 37 different stadiums in the game look decent and represent the real-life stadiums fairly accurately. The sound in the game is also done well enough that it helps add to the baseball atmosphere. The game uses the voice talents of Giants announcer Ted Robinson pretty well, too.  <P>In the end, with all of High Heat Baseball 2000's shortcomings, the game is by no means worthwhile, especially when you have so many better baseball games to choose from. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this one. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Dual Heroes,,['N64'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64']",{},"['Cool Heroes battle it out using Combo attacks in 3D space! Excited battle against the CPU Gamers with personality! Train your Robot and have it fight in the auto-battle! Give it all you got to win a Medal!', 'Altruism amongst game reviewers dictates one important rule of thumb: ""We play the stinkers so you won\'t have to."" With that said, Dual Heroes on the Nintendo 64 is one of the worst fighting games ever made for a home console system. Avoid at all costs. Developed and released by Hudson in Japan last Christmas, the game was panned by critics and gamers alike for being half the game it was championed to be. Electro Brain has decided, probably against its better judgment, to release Dual Heroes stateside. With the dearth of quality fighting titles for the Nintendo 64, it could have easily become the standard by which all other fighters would have been judged. Unfortunately, Dual Heroes has turned out to be the epitome of how exactly not to make a fighting game, or any kind of game, for that matter. <P>Behind the putrid introduction is a story that\'s so ill fitting to the game\'s overall presentation it\'s almost satirical. Why developer Hudson felt the need to supplement its fighting game with a long-drawn-out sociopolitical plot full of intrigue and complex timeline issues remains a mystery. Earth faced its biggest crisis ever, 120 years ago, as the tectonic plates shifted massively across the Pacific Ocean swallowing entire countries while creating new lands and continents. One hundred years later, a special type of body armor was developed to combat a new threat to mankind known as the Zodgierra. Huh? Four paragraphs later, the text is still scrolling, and a fight is about to take place - but nobody seems to care. Who are the Zodgierra? And why are these Power Ranger rejects beating each other to a pulp in an elevated arena? The answer is simple: Hudson wants to cash in on the lucrative fighting-games market. <P>Dual Heroes offers five modes of play: story, versus VR, versus two-player, robot training, and practice. In story mode, you choose from a roster of eight characters and fight against some of the most inane AI ever coded to win the champion title. The two-player versus mode is also fairly self-explanatory and contains no real surprises. To its credit, Dual Heroes contains the innovative versus VR and robot training modes not available in other fighting titles today. In versus VR, you battle against ""virtual gamers"" from the world of Dual Heroes. Each virtual gamer has its own fighting style - some are quick and offense heavy, while others turtle and evade. As with most prefab enemies, these virtual gamers have strengths and weaknesses, depending on which character they choose to fight with. For all its innovation, one has to presuppose that this mode was ironically implemented for those Dual Heroes devotees with no friends to fight against. Another interesting mode is the robot training mode, where the CPU learns the moves that players perform and saves them to the Nintendo Controller Pak. For anybody who\'s ever played Virtua Fighter 2 on the Saturn, this mode is similar to the customizable CPU, which slowly learns your moves and patterns to later use against you as you log hour after hour into the game. Despite numerous spins on the genre, Dual Heroes still doesn\'t cut it. For one thing, the virtual gamers themselves are rendered generic by the game\'s general lack of gameplay. Who cares about advanced AI when you can button-mash them to death with both eyes closed and one hand tied behind your back? Another gimmick employed by Dual Heroes is the ""medal system."" When you finish the game, you earn medals, which you can then use to wager or bet against your friends. However, there\'s simply no incentive to ante up the medals, because the ultimate reward for having collected a maximum of 20 medals is just a gold medal that you proudly display on your TV but does nothing to unlock any Easter eggs or new characters. To add insult to injury, the gold medals don\'t even look that nice. <P>Like everything else in this game, the controls are abominable. Movement is controlled by using the Nintendo 64 analog stick. This design decision would have made a lot more sense if Dual Heroes actually registered analog movements. As it is, controlling your ""Dual Hero"" is akin to using a large and cumbersome PC flight stick to execute moves that require a lot of quick taps. To make matters worse, there is a large number of moves that require you to perform half circles or full circles. What was Hudson thinking? The Nintendo 64 analog stick is atrociously unintuitive when it comes to circle movements due to the fact that it\'s designed to ""lock"" onto the four diagonal corners for more 3D-intensive games. Like Virtua Fighter 3, Dual Heroes uses four buttons: guard, punch, kick, and Z-movement. However, unlike the Virtua Fighter games, the controls are unresponsive and sloppy. The least Hudson could have done was to allow the victims that actually purchased Dual Heroes to customize their own buttons on the Nintendo 64 controller (which must be one of the worst fighting gamepads ever).  <P>Graphics and sound are so far below the average Nintendo 64 mediocrity that one has to wonder how Dual Heroes ever got an official ""Seal of Quality"" stamped on its package. Everything visual about Dual Heroes just screams bland, bland, and bland. The polygon textures are so blurry and phased out, the models might have actually looked better simply flat-shaded. For instance, the quality of the texture used on the floor of the fighting ring is so bad, nobody will have any idea what sort of nauseous mosaic he\'s stepping on. While the character models themselves look decent enough, their fighting moves animate poorly. This is a shame since each character\'s introductory poses are a gas to watch and really capture the essence of Japanese live-action sci-fi. As if the game doesn\'t already run like molasses, there\'s also an abundant amount of slowdown during the action. The sound effects in Dual Heroes are hard to describe because they\'re completely unmemorable. Music in the game carries the spirit of Japanese live-action television classics such as Ultraman, Kamen Rider, or Kikaider, but again, kitsch value can only carry this title so far. <P>It\'s not often a game this bad is released in the industry - twice. No game, of course, is completely without any appeal whatsoever. There will be somebody out there who will find the Power Ranger aesthetic and stilted gameplay totally engrossing. There may even be some out there who will inevitably think there are games far more offensive than Dual Heroes. They\'re probably right. Thankfully, I haven\'t had the misfortune to experience any of them firsthand... yet. --Chieh Chou <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Reboot: Playstation 1,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Electronic Arts is responsible for this license of the kid\'s television show ReBoot, made by the same folks who brought us the Beast Wars Transformers show. Like the show, this 3D shooter is about a team of cyber-people living in a virtual world called Mainframe, who must defend it from one of the silliest- monikered villains in recent memory... the dreaded ""Megabyte."" As is no surprise to anyone following the history of video game licenses, the game offers mediocre gameplay whose few innovations are overshadowed by the half-baked quality of the game\'s control and graphics. <P>The game\'s standard-issue 3D over-the-shoulder (and sometimes behind-the-back) shooting engine should feel familiar to most of us by now. The D-pad controls forward and backward motion and left and right rotation. Strafing is accomplished with the L1 and R1 buttons. As Bob, you wander around the 3D world, blasting bad guys and gaining power-ups, new weapons, and health bonuses. In addition, it\'s your job to repair tears in the cyber-fabric. These are represented by glowing crystalline orbs that are both deadly to the touch and have a nasty habit of sucking you in - as well as shooting off powerful beams of energy. To make matters worse, when one appears, you\'re given a mere few minutes (complete with onscreen countdown) to get up close and personal and use your special tear repair gun - called a ""glitch"" - to mend the tear. This is a sticky process and usually involves holding the glitch beam on target for several moments while the tear\'s volatile energies make it difficult for you to stand up, not to mention frequently sending you flying across the room with half your life energy missing. <P>Further complicating matters is your means of transportation. Rather than simply running around the gameworld on foot, you use something called a Zipboard (which looks like a disc attached to each foot, with a cord running between them) to sort of half float and half skate your way around. Unfortunately, control of the Zipboard is sloppy and difficult to master at best, and once you start off in a particular direction, it\'s not always easy to stop. Over wide-open, flat surfaces it\'s difficult to get where you want to go by the most direct route, since you\'re constantly veering off course, reorienting your direction, and backtracking. Throw in a few obstacles and some narrow causeways, and you\'re bumping into stuff left and right, and falling off ramps, often plummeting back to ground level just when you\'ve almost made it to the top. Luckily, the Zipboard also prevents death by falling, since it\'s continually emitting an infinitesimal vertical force. It really gets ugly when you\'re attempting to hold a tear on target and it keeps swatting you around, making you lose the shot, and sending you and your dumb Zipboard spinning off. You can\'t help but feel that if you just had regular shoes on instead, you could just take care of business and be done with it. <P>Why is it that games and movies about hi-tech cyber-beings living inside computers don\'t have better graphics? As with everything from its predecessor Tron until now, ReBoot tends to settle for large, brightly colored geometric shapes in lieu of detailed textures or color. ""But, dude, they\'re inside a computer. It\'s trippy."" Humph. Perhaps the auspices of techno-kitsch make that excuse work for Tron, but ReBoot just doesn\'t deal well with the paradox. A low frame rate and ample polygon dropout reveal the game\'s true low-tech nature. It\'s plagued with camera troubles, too - all too often the jump you need to make is to a platform that you can\'t quite see from where you\'re standing - and the game offers no player-controlled camera tweaks. <P>ReBoot might be interesting to fans of the TV series, but as a stand-alone game left to its own merits, it just doesn\'t fly. The sketchy graphics don\'t tell you all you need to know, and from a design standpoint the levels are uninspired - though fans of the show will like the cute animated cutscenes featuring other ReBoot characters. Most importantly though, it\'s the game\'s awkward control that sets a new benchmark for frustration and will doubtless cause many players to throw their controllers across the room, turn off the PlayStation, and never reboot this one. --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Street Fighter Collection 2,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['In a flurry of Super Combos these monumental releases started a revolution and spawned a generation of arcade warriors. Choose your warrior and battle through 3 classic games in their true arcade form.', 'In 1991, arcades were, to put it mildly, suffering. Most games in that era were shooters, or bland walk-to-the-right-and-hit-buttons-fast beat \'em ups. Capcom released a quiet sequel to one of its games and consequently changed the way we play. The game, of course, was Street Fighter II. SF2 and its various sequels spawned an arcade revolution, the effects of which are still felt to this very day. Capcom\'s previous Street Fighter collection contained some of the later Street Fighter titles. This second pack contains the original Street Fighter 2, and its two upgrades, SF2: Champion Edition, and SF2 Turbo: Hyper Fighting. <P>The games have translated onto the PlayStation very well, which, given that the arcade version\'s engine was programmed in 1991, isn\'t too surprising. The games all look, sound, and play like their arcade counterparts. There is also a small museum-type section that contains info and art from the games. <P>The gameplay holds up nicely after all these years. While it may seem a bit plain and a little sluggish compared to some of the games we\'ve seen since, these games are still the chess of the fighting game world. Everything else is merely checkers. I was immediately reminded of the time (and, ouch, the money) I spent in arcades with these three games. The weeks of practice it took for me to become a respectable player. The thirty or so times that I just never went back to school after lunch, because I was stuck at a pizza place with a few friends, glued to Champion Edition. <P>Graphically, the game does look dated, even though Capcom has been using roughly the same character graphics for several years now. The soundtrack is still really good. These classic tunes can be remixed forever, but the originals still sound the best. The PlayStation also makes a smooth transition from the normal to the hyped-up ""near-death"" music with nearly no load time. However, the game does have a significant, though not overbearing load between fights. <P>Forget the other Street Fighter Collection. This is the volume that is actually worth owning. Those of you who spent hundreds of dollars on these three games when they first came out owe it to yourselves to have a copy of this around, even if only for posterity\'s sake. You never know when you\'ll want to see how well those skills hold up against an old friend. Those of you that haven\'t played these games really should at least rent this collection.

Forged in the fires of the Dark Ages Mace is the hottest 3D fighting game ever! Each medieval character wields a weapon unique to their land of origin. Their only desire inflict serious pain!', ""Mace was a beautiful 3D arcade fighting game that relied on the 3Dfx Voodoo processor to deliver incredible scenery and animation. Unfortunately, the gameplay didn't stand up to the game's amazing appearance. The N64 is a faithful recreation of Mace: It looks fantastic but still plays poorly. <P>The story in Mace revolves around - you guessed it - a mace. Whoever wields the mace on Tanis is granted immortality and all kinds of crazy power, so a bunch of characters have gotten together to fight for it. These fighters include Al Rashid, an assassin that fights with two scimitars; the Executioner, complete with his hood and giant axe; and Lord Demios, an evil knight with a giant sword. <P>The graphics in Mace are some of the most beautiful N64 scenes to date. The backgrounds look absolutely terrific, and the characters all look very good. The frame rate is mostly smooth, although it sometimes takes a noticeable dip when characters fall into the water or lava surrounds some of the stages. Also, the character action is a bit jumpy, leading to some confusion when things get hectic. The soundtrack is decent, but the sword clashes sound more like an inflated rubber ball bouncing on a schoolyard blacktop than actual swordplay. <P>Mace is all fine and good while you're watching it, but the minute you pick up the controller, the facade is shattered. The fighting is best described as a button-pounder, similar to Dark Rift, Virtua Fighter, and others, but it also has Street Fighter-style fireballs, dragon punches, and other special moves. The game has fatalities (called executions here) that all look pretty cool but don't really help the game's dull combo system and uninteresting moves very much. <P>All in all, Mace is a depressing game. It looks so good that you really want to like it, but it just isn't very much fun to play at all. It falls squarely between Dark Rift and War Gods in the realm of 3D fighting on the N64.

The biggest overall flaw is that the game is a poor conversion of a poor arcade title. This is one game that shouldn't have come home. <P>Off Road Challenge, for all intents and purposes, is Cruis'n USA with dirt tracks and off-road vehicles. It even inherited Cruis'n's sluggish control and frame rate. The game has inherited its name from the old three-player arcade game, Ironman Ivan Stweart's Off Road, and it's retained a few basic elements from the old game. Winning races earns you money so you can upgrade your vehicle in five categories: acceleration, shocks, nitro, top speed, and tires. You also find cash, nitros, and other goodies during the race. The most frustrating thing about Off Road Challenge is that you aren't allowed to actually go off the road. You're kept on the track by an invisible barrier. The only fun you'll have while racing is running into all of the wacky stuff that comes across your path like trains, planes, and UFOs.  <P>The graphics in Off Road Challenge are by no means good. The weak frame rate accompanied by the really bad pop-up makes for one of the most visually impaired racing games on the N64. There are three different camera views to change from during the race. A chase view, a closer chase view, and an inside-the-cab view. The sound effects and music are pretty annoying. The sound of the tires sliding out is just bad, and the different music tracks are all kind of weak. <P>All in all, Off Road Challenge is a flawed conversion of an arcade game that just isn't any fun at home.

Game play is organized around a series of missions in which you must plan and execute precise assaults on terrorist installations. As your mission advances, you will uncover a larger and more sinister conspiracy, where the fate of the world hangs in the balance. And unlike other games, if you make a mistake, you're gone--because in the real world, one shot counts."", ""The race to topple Electronic Arts' SEAL Team from the top of the special forces genre has heated up tremendously. First was Zombie Interactive's Spec Ops, released earlier this year. Both Novalogic and Interactive Magic have their own games coming out later this year. Now, Red Storm Entertainment weighs in with its own game, buoyed by the marketable name of Tom Clancy and his story-telling capability. Players take control of the international Rainbow team of super-secret operatives, doing the dirty work other modern nations wouldn't publicly touch. While generally better than Spec Ops, Rainbow Six carries its own baggage, especially where the conflict of realism versus gameplay rears its ugly head."", 'Rainbow Six offers several modes of play, including a large variety of training missions (different shooting ranges, obstacle courses, single-team hostage rescue, multiteam hostage rescue, and so on), the main campaign, and various multiplayer scenarios (like cooperative mission, deathmatch, and team deathmatch). The campaign can be played in one of three difficulty levels, with more objectives and less team casualty tolerance as the difficulty level increases. The campaigns resemble a tree trunk rather than a branching tree, so to get to the next mission, you must successfully complete the previous one.', 'Rainbow Six contains two main parts: mission planning and mission execution. For the first four missions in the campaign, Red Storm has provided a prescripted mission plan, but the next 12, you must do all the work. First comes the mission storyline and notes from various characters, of which most is not required reading to finish the mission. After picking which agents to use on the mission, what team they\'ll be on, and what equipment they\'ll use, it\'s time to hit the mission planning interface. The player is supplied with a complete floor plan of the area in question, possible and known locations of terrorists, where the mission objectives are, and so on. The player lays out where the teams will go, which ""go"" codes to use, the rules of engagement, and speed options. While a 3D rendering of the map is available, the only downside is that you can no longer see the movement paths of your teams; they\'re covered up.', ""After making sure you've got the mission planned (and make sure it's been saved), it's time to play out the mission. The interface is fairly similar to any number of modern first-person games like Quake II and Unreal, and graphically, the game is on par or slightly better than Spec Ops. The game models human motions and movement extremely well, including many different unique actions. Rainbow Six's audio cues, background sounds, and other various noises are also represented very well; the immersive feeling of Rainbow Six is perhaps one of the best seen in a game. The only downside is that, for some, the mouse interface can be a bit sensitive for those that are not used to it and can only be tuned from Windows."", ""A mission plays out as you take control of one of the teams, the others follow scripted layouts already devised in the mission planner. You can switch between the teams easily, but not team members. Teams follow waypoints, engaging enemies that come within range with ruthless efficiency (or mindless stupidity, as you'll learn) or waiting for a go code to move on to the next waypoint. With some decent planning and a bit (or lots) of human guidance, you can complete the missions and the game."", ""Well, it seems a bit simple, but in reality, Rainbow Six is pretty hard. The game skirts the magical barrier between realism and gameplay, hedging a bit on realism on some features and going straight overboard on the gameplay front. While combat is fast and furious, with one or two bullets almost guaranteeing a kill, the AI is schizophrenic at best and can kill your members at a moment's notice without them having the slightest clue as to how they can react to an adverse situation."", ""For example, suppose you had a team of four members moving down a corridor with rooms on either side. Let's say the team is moving to the other end of the corridor, and a terrorist is in one of the side rooms. As each member goes by the room, the terrorist guns him down. He doesn't react to the fire except by rushing toward the next waypoint like an eager lemming. Terrorists seem to react the same way; one particular encounter saw a terrorist calmly smoking a cigarette standing around the bodies of two dead buddies. Grenades seem to have an explosion range of about two feet."", ""Obviously, lots can go wrong in a mission. You will spend lots of time refining your mission layout, which really gives the impression that the missions are puzzle-oriented, which, in a way, they are. Typically, you'll be doing lots of the work (killing) personally, since the AI handles tight room environments very badly. Expect to replay missions 20, 30, or 40 times to complete them without high casualty counts. At times, it can get very annoying and frustrating. Then again, if you treat the entire game as things would happen in real life, Rainbow Six would be insanely difficult - with all its faults, it's fairly hard enough already."", 'Multiplayer saves the game though and allows basically unlimited replay of the missions with multiple teams (making coordination and reaction times much better, despite the typical lag), and deathmatches are sweaty do-or-die affairs where one good bullet to the head puts you out for the rest of the game. Replayability is also helped by the fact that there are a lot of different ways to complete a mission, and they get much harder as the difficulty level goes up.', ""So, just what is Rainbow Six? It's actually a pretty good game, albeit very hard and extremely frustrating. Some of the gameplay mechanics simply go straight against common sense, but some concessions had to be made to accommodate computer gameplay. Other elements are very realistic, and some of the gameplay elements are right on the money. Players who thought Spec Ops had lots of potential but didn't execute well should check out Rainbow Six because, despite the faults, the game does work better and does have that immersive, realistic feel. Players can even experiment with the game mechanics by looking at some of the definition files in the Rainbow Six directory. Rainbow Six is a pretty good game that over time - and perhaps with official and unofficial support - may become a great game.<i>--Alan Dunkin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Cardinal Syn sticks to the Kronos model as a good-looking 3D fighter that offers nothing in the vein of innovative gameplay.', ""The game starts out with eight playable characters, but every time you beat the tournament mode the game unlocks a new playable character. It's got the usual modes of play we've come to expect from fighting games: tournament, vs., team battle, survival, and training mode. Cardinal Syn, as far as gameplay features go, is fairly standard. The only crazy things outside the norm are the in-game hazards and treasure chests. The hazards include things such as a mining car that rumbles down the tracks, which you and your opponent happen to be fighting on, or a giant snowball that crashes down a nearby mountain. The levels also have various treasure chests lying about that contain health, added strength, and bombs that damage your character."", 'Visually, Cardinal Syn is quite appealing. The characters and the 3D arenas that they fight in are incredibly detailed. The motion of the characters is a little fast but looks fairly fluid. That mixed with snazzy lighting effects gives Cardinal Syn a very clean look. All of this is seen from a camera angle that for most of the time is a side view, although sometimes the view is obscured for a frustrating second or two when a piece of the background gets in the way. The music and sound effects fit the medieval theme of the game quite well. With the clashing of swords and over-the-top modern gothic music, the game sounds noticeably rich.', ""The AI of the computer-controlled fighters is just plain poor. They run through preset patterns that you can see even after only a short time playing, and once you've learned the patterns, you simply create a pattern that counters theirs. Needless to say, this becomes incredibly boring. Even on the hardest setting the gameplay is composed of knocking your opponent down and trying to keep him there. Otherwise he gets up and starts this seemingly endless barrage of high and low attacks."", 'Cardinal Syn has some nice graphics and sound to set it apart from other games in the genre, at least on the surface. But once all is said and done, with its typical weapon-based fighting system that plays like Soul Blade and Dynasty Warriors, Cardinal Syn just ends up coming off as another 3D fighting game knockoff. --Ryan Mac Donald <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

It comes from the creator of such classics as Star Control and Archon, and many similarities to these games can be drawn. The game features a wide variety of very unique characters that all have special weapons, which are used to annihilate each other in a true 3D arena.  <P>The game has two modes of play. Combat mayhem is an arcade-styled 3D weapon-based fighting game. You select one of the two races to battle with (each team has seven characters to choose from). Your opponent, whether human or computer controlled, selects which fighter he'll send into battle. Once one of the characters is destroyed, the loser picks another fighter from his team to battle. This goes on until all of the characters from one team have been defeated. The second mode of play, combat tactics, lets you position your characters on a hexagonal board. Each player takes a turn and is allowed to move his characters. Every time you take a turn you are rewarded with points. These points can be used to purchase reinforcements and initiate a special attack from the board. Once two characters meet on the board, a real-time battle begins. <P>The Unholy War, at its roots, is basically a game of chess. Both sides have characters with their own individual attacks. You strategically move these pieces on a board. And once you reach an opposing character, a battle ensues. Since each character on both teams has its own individual strengths and weaknesses, it's critically important to choose the right character to use against each foe. This strategic angle of the game is limited and simply adds more to do in the game than just battling. <P>The control is elegantly basic. You can use either the D-pad or analog stick to control the characters. Each character has three forms of attack ranging from laser blasts to punches. The fourth button is used for jumping or, for certain characters, flying. <P>Graphically, Unholy War is beautiful. The polygonal characters all look amazingly detailed. The lighting effects used give life to the explosions and energy weapons. The 14 different maps that you fight on all look great and all have unique terrain, weather, and obstacles. The intelligent camera is fantastic; it zooms out when you and your opponent get some distance between each other and then zooms in when you get closer.  Overall, Unholy War is a really fun game, especially when playing with another player. However, the AI of the computer is really good, and you can have fun fighting it out alone as well. The only negative side to the game is its lack of depth. The combat tactics mode really doesn't offer that much more to the game.

Fiendishly tough bosses. New weapons. New ships. All new 3-D graphics. The deadly Bydo are back so load up your weapons and gear up for the most intense arcade action ever. 7 levels of shoot'em up action. Top scorers can post and compare scores on the Agetec Website."", 'No one can really say what Irem\'s been doing over the last few years - after the shooter market bottomed out in the early 90s, it\'s definitely a surprise to see a game from them at all, let alone a game as solid as R-Type Delta. Hopping on the industry classic-games-revival bandwagon, Irem has breathed new life into its genre-defining R-Type series and produced a truly excellent shooter. <P>R-Type was one of the first shooters to actively employ the concept of strategy in a side-scrolling shooter, primarily through the use of the ""Force Unit."" As before, the Force Unit is an indestructible satellite that can be strategically mounted on the front or back of your ship, in addition to being launched into remote corners of the screen to deal with enemies before your ship arrives there. Not only is this useful, in many cases it is essential to completing an area and surviving. R-Type Delta has two new ships in addition to the original, each with its own unique satellites and weapons. One ship sports a tracking Force Unit that seeks out enemies when launched, while the other is ""anchored"" to the ship with a stream of destructive energy. Strategic use of these satellites is essential to the game\'s completion, and thus each type of Force Unit will require you to employ different attack strategies. In addition to the satellites, you can charge up powerful bolts of energy with which to lash out against the Bydo empire. Each ship\'s charged weapon is different and has two stages of charge. Finally, you can absorb enemy damage with the Force Unit to build up a use of the Delta Weapon, a graphic spasm of pure destruction. Beyond those basics, R-Type Delta is essentially another side-scrolling, polygonally based shooter in the vein of Einhander or G Darius. Each of the game\'s seven levels features the requisite midbosses and bosses, multidirectional scrolling, and bullet dodging. Unlike some other shooters, most of this game\'s difficulty comes from the levels themselves, rather than the bosses. All of the game\'s bosses have several impressive and inventive attacks, but many die too quickly to really be appreciated. R-Type Delta is a hard game, for sure, but you are rewarded with additional continues the more you play - theoretically, anyone can win this game if they spend enough time with it.  <P>Like all of the recent series updates, R-Type Delta spares no expense in the aesthetics department. The traditionally 2D series has been completely made over in beautiful 3D, sporting the kind of graphical polish one would expect from Square. Each of the game\'s levels is interestingly detailed and never feels repetitive like many of Einhander\'s staid levels did. In addition to myriad little graphical touches, R-Type Delta uses tons of effects and transparency to give the game an excellent sci-fi look and feel. The enemies are equally varied, each sporting unique explosions and attacks. Many enemies and bosses are taken right from the original games and modeled in 3D, adding a pleasing nostalgia to the experience for R-Type veterans. R-Type Delta is much more colorful than the traditional PlayStation game, almost to the point of being garish. All of this graphic polish does come at the cost of the game\'s frame rate, however. The game\'s speed drops are noticeable but never interfere with gameplay and are even welcome at times. The game\'s sound is top-notch, scoring the game with a catchy fusion of rock and techno that changes with the game\'s surroundings. For example, diving underwater in the second stage changes the music to a much mellower, aquatic variation on the stage\'s theme. Sound effects are somewhat underplayed but still effective. In addition to many new sounds, a number of classic R-Type sound effects are present to take the nostalgia one step further.  <P>If there\'s one PlayStation shooter to own, R-Type Delta is that shooter. Despite a handful of frustrating parts, R-Type Delta gives shooter fans exceptional gameplay, variety, and replay, in addition to carrying the spirit of the original on in style. --Peter Bartholow <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Based on Games Workshop's non-electronic series this epic contest casts the player as leader of the Empire's notorious Grudgebringer faction. The dark strife-ridden Warhammer world is under siege from both the barbarian orcs massing at the Empire's gates and agents of chaos represented by the forces of the Horned Rat living within those walls. The player-character is unknowingly drawn into a web of intrigue that leads to the command of a mercenary army and a series of battles which will determine the fate of civilization."", 'Adapted from the popular tabletop role-playing franchise of the same name, Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat attempts to combine the fighting features of WarCraft with the character development of Final Fantasy. The result is a confusing amalgam of the two, with the strengths of neither title, and will appeal only to the die-hard fans of the license. Players assume the role of the leader of the ""Grudgebringers"" army. Warriors are chosen, hired, and fired at will. In battle, they play like a small stack of cylinders that simply run into other armies, sometimes coming out, sometimes not. The gameplay offers little involvement, leaving gamers to click around, trying to get the guys to the right place at the right time. There\'s no personality to the actual battle. The special warriors are indistinct, blending into one another, yielding neither WarCraft\'s sense of ""parenting"" nor the sense of intimacy with the characters that standard console RPGs provide. In addition, the controls are very difficult to pick up, with icons that simply are not clear, forcing memorization rather than recognition.  There are plenty of missions, none of which is particularly exciting. The frequent ambushes make for boring battles. In short, the fighting is uninvolving and the story uninteresting. The graphics leave much to be desired as well. Although the cutscenes are beautifully rendered and the images of the secretary are nice, as are the little photos of the leader and his teammates, the actual gameplay features only clumps of tiny, 8-bit-like men running around on a map, bumping into other clumps of men. Missing is the charisma of the individual characters of WarCraft.  A fan of the tabletop franchise may want to give Warhammer a shot. Strategy mavens who don\'t care much about visuals may find some excitement here, too, but the average video game RPG fan has seen bigger and better, and plenty of it.  <I>--Hugh Sterbakov </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Hot Shots Golf,,"['1-4 Players', 'Multitap Adaptable', 'Vivid Graphics', '10 Unique Characters', 'Bonus: 18 Holes of Minature Golf']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Fighting for attention in the game world isn't easy, not when you're up against games like Xenogears, Tekken 3, and Gran Turismo. But last year, Sony quietly released a game that took the Japanese gaming public by storm - that game was Everybody's Golf. Developed by Camelot, a team better known for producing RPGs such as Shining the Holy Ark and Sega's upcoming Shining Force III, Everybody's Golf stood high above the sales charts for a good portion of the year due to its attractive graphics and ease of gameplay. In a move bound to please golf enthusiasts and curious onlookers alike, Sony has brought its flagship golf game to our shores under the moniker of Hot Shots Golf. <P>Unlike most golf sims, Hot Shots Golf is easy to pick up and play for both novices and pros. Upon firing up the game you'll notice a number of options available to you from the outset. Beginners will most likely want to take advantage of the lessons menu. This option will take you through three in-game lessons designed to introduce you to the controls as well as the fundamental principles of golf. For those who want to get used to the controls or just have a little fun, there's a Mini Golf option available. Although you won't find any windmills here, it's still a good 18-hole introduction to the basic play mechanics of the game. Players who consider themselves proficient with the ins and outs of golf will probably want to jump right into the Play Game option. Selecting this will bring up a menu from which you can select a wide variety of play modes. Stroke play, where the player with the least amount of strokes wins; match play, where the number of holes won decides the winner; and the self-explanatory training mode are available from the start. However, for avid golf game fans, the modes most likely to whet the appetite are the tournament and vs. modes. Tournament mode is a one-player game that lets you compete in a full round of golf against a grid of computer-controlled golfers. Vs. mode pits you against a single computer-controlled player for a round of golf. If you defeat your opponent, he/she will now be selectable as a playerin the game. Up to eight secret characters may be obtained, each with his own strengths and weaknesses. For players who excel at their game, a mystery mode awaits once you have accumulated enough experience points to unlock it. <P>Experience points are obtained every time you complete a round of golf in any mode except training mode. The amount of points gained will vary depending on how good your tournament score is. Long putts and hole-in-ones will also add to your experience points. Gamers will benefit from competing in all of the various modes and will gain the most experience points as a result. Stat freaks will be able to keep track of their own and other gamers' statistics in the status screen, where you will be able to view things such as the best score, records, trophies, super shots (a replay theater of your best shots), and versus data. You can also alter the configurations to change things like background music, bets (where you can bet on different aspects of the game), caddy voice (man or woman), and caddy mode. Caddy mode will help beginners considerably by making their club selections for them. This option greatly reduces the frustration of trying to master the subtle nuances of golf, while educating the gamer on the best clubs for the right situations. <P>During actual gameplay, you'll find things like the wind affecting your line drives. By pressing R2 you'll throw some grass up in the air to see where the wind, if any, is blowing. Using the directional pad, you can view the course from a full 360 degrees, and from virtually any elevation, before making your shot selection. Taking your swing is as easy as pressing the X button to start power gauge, again once the bar is full and a third time to actually swing. The square button is used to adjust the hitting power from either power mode or approach mode. Power mode lets you hit a shot farther than normal, but can only be used a limited number of times. Approach mode gives you more control over your shot but is limited to 60 yards, no matter which club you choose. The flight path of the ball can also be affected by pressing the direction pad after starting your swing. Holding left or right will arc the ball left or right, while holding down will send the ball higher and will keep it from rolling too far. Holding up will result in a shot that flies lower but rolls farther. Terrain and wind conditions will dictate what sort of shot you'll need to take. <P>Graphically, the game is as pleasing a golf game as you're likely to see. The well-designed polygonal courses all scroll smoothly, while shifting camera angles track the flight of the ball. The characters are large, well-animated sprites that look like they were taken straight out of Shining the Holy Ark and dressed up in golf gear. The sound has been handled well, with the whoosh of a club striking the ball sounding exactly as you'd expect. Ambient noises such as birds chirping also help bring a certain authenticity to the game. The one thing you might want to turn off is the music; while you're not exactly standing on the green needing absolute concentration, it can be fairly obnoxious at times. Loading times, as advertised, are remarkably short, with barely a couple seconds' wait between menus and game. Hot Shots Golf also doubles as a party game, as up to four players can compete against each other, provided you have a multi-tap. <P>In the end, what Hot Shots Golf has managed to achieve is a game that looks good, is easy to play, and is difficult to master. No mean feat in any gaming category, let alone golf. Camelot has also managed to create a golf game that will appeal not only to golf fans but the average gamer as well. It's a game loaded with options and secrets that beg to be discovered and promises a good time along the way. While some hard-core golf fanatics might be turned off by the cartoonish nature of the characters, this in no way detracts from the game, and in some ways enhances it as well. So, while we wait to see what Electronic Arts does with its Tiger Woods license, gamers and golf fans alike would do well to investigate Hot Shots Golf, the golf game that truly is everybody's golf. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Code name: Thunder Force! This is the first installment of the massively popular shooter series on a 32-bit platform and the enhancements of this new version is obvious from the moment your eyes and ears are overwhelmed by the the audio-visual feast. Five spectacular weapons with multiple power-up levels let you blast through the metallic menace and look good going it. A constant barrage of innovative enemies keeps you intrigued while you're trying to stay alive. A speaker-imploding soundtrack has your foot tapping to the funky beat. Unbelievable rendered cutscenes don't just draw you but drag you kicking and screaming into the action."", ""Originally released in Japan last year for the Sega Saturn, Thunder Force V was the latest installment in Technosoft's legendary series of shooters. While American Saturn owners watched helplessly as SOA passed on yet another highly desired piece of software, it came as no surprise to find that Technosoft was in the process of porting it to the PlayStation. Working Designs quickly saw an opportunity where others had not and subsequently announced it was bringing Thunder Force V to the States via its Spaz label. <P>So, fans of shooters gather round and behold the first episode of Thunder Force rendered in semi-3D glory. As with all previous Thunder Force games, you control your ship from the left side of the screen and proceed to dish out punishment on the endless waves of antagonists who swarm in from the right. Helping you avoid these nasty predators are analog control and the ability to alter your ship's speed from 50-100 percent. Along the way you pick up a large variety of weapons and power-ups from amongst the remains of the recently dispatched. Twin shots, hunter shots, wave, and other exotic weapons are available for the taking, which when powered up with floating energy balls called craw, can be triggered to unleash a massive attack, whose power level depends on the amount of craw obtained at the time. Usually these super attacks are reserved for the huge bosses that await at the end of each level. <P>Considering that little tweaking was necessary to improve the relatively basic gameplay, Technosoft was able to concentrate on the visuals. Although the game plays in 2D, like any decent shooter worth its salt these days, it incorporates 3D details and polygonal enemies and bosses. During introductory sequences, the camera will pan 360 degrees, but that's about it. For any real 3D action you'll need to wait until the bosses to see some polygonal power. As far as additions to the PlayStation version go, a couple of extra levels have been added to bolster what was once a relatively short game. Some nicely done CG sequences were also included to make this a very complete package. Other small but welcome details that were included are a digital viewer, which lets you look at hi-res artwork rendered for the game, and a time attack mode, although it's up for discussion why anyone would want to play a time attack in a side-scrolling shooter. <P>The difference between the Saturn version and the PlayStation version of Thunder Force V, aside from the extra levels and stuff, are few but worth mentioning. Perhaps, due to the ease of rendering 3D on the PlayStation, there is very little slowdown, something that could be found (in small but noticeable amounts) during boss encounters on the Saturn version. The sound effects also seem much clearer on Sony's gray box for some reason. Although the graphics and textures appear a little bit sharper on the Saturn, there's no need for alarm as the two are almost identical to each other. Perhaps the only negative thing about the game is that it's basically the same as any other shooter when you really get down to it. Despite the eye candy and extra window dressing, this is still just a shooter. That having been said, it should be noted that it's an excellent shooter. <P>For Thunderforce fans who own a PlayStation, this is a coup. Not only do you get a technically superior version of Thunder Force V, you get it with all the extra bells and whistles too, providing considerable value and excellent gameplay. Spaz/Working Designs has once again catered to the fans and brought over a perennial fan-favorite. Easily as good as Raystorm or G-Darius and tough competition for Einhander, Thunder Force V is a shooting fan's dream. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The Fifth Element,,['Disc plus hard plastic protective replacement case only. Disc condition ranges from flawless to scratched but is guaranteed to work.'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""No need to waste time clamoring about lousy feature film to video game metamorphoses; let's just say that Activision's The Fifth Element PlayStation game is a textbook example of the conversion conundrum - and quite possibly the worst game I've ever played.  <P>The game loosely follows the broader themes of the Luc Besson uberfilm of the same title - which starred Bruce Willis as Korben and Milla Jovanovich as Leeloo, two characters on a course to save the world - and sticks all of this drama on the Nightmare Creatures game engine Kalisto unleashed on us exactly one year ago. Within the single-player action-adventure game, you play as both Leeloo and Korben, or each character's cut-rate-designed likeness anyway, not one or the other. Meaning as you progress through the game, you'll switch between Korben and Leeloo, depending on the level. The difference between the two is basically defined by Leeloo's acrobatics and hand-to-hand combat style and Korben's firearms. Your goal is simple enough: follow extremely basic and elementary missions that play out more like a treasure hunt than an adventure game, and do this over and over until you've completed over 20 levels of sheer agony and boredom.  <P>But it's not the painfully rudimentary missions that make this game a washout; it's the ugly graphics and the incredibly foul gameplay mechanics that make The Fifth Element such an embarrassingly bad game. As Korben, you shoot your enemies (the cops, the cops' floating surveillance units, whatever) with a stockpile of unlimited ammo to get them out of your way; however, where you aim, as long as you're in the vicinity, doesn't really seem to matter. In fact, on a couple of occasions, the lack of precision shooting was so obvious, the subject I was aiming at seemed to arbitrarily fall to the ground and promptly disappear. My bullets traveled beyond him and off to his left. But alas, he died anyway. Maybe it was fear. And naturally, a good part of shooting straight is being able to sight. Can you aim, or tighten up your angle? Nope. Since there isn't a look feature, you just have to turn the clunky characters in the general direction you want to shoot, and hope for the best.  <P>Also, large rings of graphical fire form around your characters when you're shot at, so as to mask the lack of target precision as well. And because it's impossible to move on without mentioning this, if someone is shooting at Korben, and you can hear the enemy's shots, you won't be able to hear your own until your enemy's shots cease. So you won't even really know if you're cappin' or nappin' - not that it matters because your enemies die so quickly and easily anyhow.  <P>While playing as Leeloo, you trade in your guns for a charming little worthless cartwheel/flip-type event that lends you some variety, but with very little usefulness. Leeloo mostly uses her fists and her kicks as weapons, with various scattered grenades and such she picks up along the way. The 3D fighting engine, however, is worse than Nightmare Creatures. Either it's magic, or Leeloo can manage to punch the cop who's not even within arm's reach, but yet she won't be able to turn and punch the guy who's punching her. On a semi-positive note, the characters can, on occasion and sometimes with no purpose at all, hang from the ceiling and monkey-bar their way across a room or hall, crawl under sensor beams, and roll away from enemy fire as needed. <P>In spite of the game's many levels, the missions are terribly simplistic, often making a task that may have completed the previous mission, a new mission entirely (would you actually free someone from prison and not escape yourself within the same mission?). The real challenge in The Fifth Element, notably, is managing the lousy controls, as the puzzles are insultingly easy, and the course of action is inanely dull.  <P>The graphics are grainy, loaded with seams, awkward perspectives (no, you don't have any control over the camera at all, which makes it pretty dated at this late point in time), blind platform jumps, and pop-up from the get-go, and they don't improve. The intro and the cutscenes are better, naturally, as they're excerpts from the film itself - often in the form of non sequiturs that have been wrapped around the game's anemic plot.  <P>The enemy AI is laughable, as well. When in the same room with several enemies, if you're attacking one, the others seem to linger behind a bit, then move up when the first guy's down. Or if they are up close to you, they seem to be dancing, rather than attacking you, until you turn your attention toward them, respectively.  <P>The Fifth Element has an OK soundtrack. It's not good, but it's not intrusive. And coming from a game that should receive a quality citation, one mediocre feature is perhaps its only saving grace. Kalisto should have spent more time on this engine. Period. The game is not fun, not pretty, and not challenging. And the sad part is, Activision can't even cash in on the movie license, because the characters look nothing like those in the movie. Don't waste your money on this game, and if you're walking around the rental store, get the movie, not the game.  --Lauren Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

NHL 97 Hockey - PlayStation (Special),,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['PlayStation ~ Nhl 97 Hockey', ""As a stand alone hockey title, NHL 97 is a top-notch effort, complete with all the detail, realism, and pro licenses anyone could expect from a quality sports sim. However, as an EA Sports product - especially when compared to the mind-blowing new PC version - NHL 97 falls a bit short of the company's usually lofty standards. Or put another way, the game rocks but doesn't go the extra mile."", 'While the good far outweighs the bad here, the truth is that a handful of inexcusable glitches stick out like sore thumbs. The game is without an on-ice ref, which means face offs are triggered by a puck that floats over the players\' heads for a few seconds before it drops to the ice. There are more realistic ways to depict something as basic as faceoffs. Play-by-play commentary is also conspicuously absent: Players get only the occasional goal or penalty announcement from FOX and NY Rangers color great John Davidson. Most shots on goal don\'t seem nearly as fast as they should, even when the ""speed check"" radar gun clocks a blast at 80+ mph The majority of goals scored by the computer would be considered softies by pro hockey standards - in fact, shots your goalie should stop blindfolded often slide past him and into the net. Gone too are overall team ratings, used to help weigh the decision when selecting teams. (Using the numerical ratings to pick a strong team and play against a weaker squad is often a good way to learn basic gameplay mechanics, but here - unless you\'re very familiar with NHL teams - you\'ll just have to guess.) Line changes on the fly can only be made when your team is on offense, which means you can forget about killing a penalty and firing the puck the length of the ice to get fresh players...once you clear the puck, a line change cannot be made. Lastly, and this is truly bizarre, when the computer-controlled team is down in the final minute of play, it will pull the goalie for a sixth attacker - yet only five players will be on the ice with an empty net behind them. Granted, these are minor faults, but an EA Sports title should be devoid of these bush league imperfections.', ""Minor points of contention aside, NHL 97 is still one of the best hockey sims yet on a 32-bit system, perhaps second only to Virgin's spectacular NHL Powerplay 96. Despite the occasional animation hiccup, the 3-D polygon players skate, shoot, and body check with exceptional realism. Jersey numbers and team logos are clearly visible on all players. You can trade and create players during a season and even track stats for up to eight saved seasons at once. All 26 NHL teams, two All-Star teams, and over 650 real NHL players are included. The crowd, reflections on the ice, the haze of the glass, and the advertisements along the boards all add to the game's realistic look and feel. The gameplay is super-quick, and control is dead-on and responsive. Featuring nine camera angles to choose from during gameplay (eleven in replay mode), a shootout option to practice penalty shots or to improve your goalie's reflexes, and the customary exhibition, season, and best-of-seven playoff modes, this game's got it all."", ""If you're in the market for a Playstation hockey title, look no further than NHL 97 - even if it lacks the perfection generally expected of EA Sports. --Jeff Kitts <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

MDK,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['It thinks. Therefore it kills. Available now with six new arenas designed exclusively for the PlayStation. MDK combines the elements of stealth ambush program in- telligence stunning futuristic graphics and a wide open playing environment. In the not too distant future alien beings known as slavery.', 'Shiny has created another stylish, funny shooter with MDK, which lands solidly in the 3D shooting adventure gaming genre, with a heavy emphasis on shooting. You play Kurt, who is armed to the teeth and sent onto the orbiting spacecraft of aliens hell-bent on destroying the Earth, and race through room after room of jumping and shooting, with a little sniper-view action thrown in for good measure. With innovative graphics, great level design, and awesome special weapons, everything looks great on paper. A number of flaws limit the game\'s life span, though, and raise questions about what\'s really important in games - style, mood, and vibe or solid gameplay, consistent graphics, and a continual challenge. <P>From a design standpoint, the graphics are amazing: goofy, ugly, stupid-looking monsters; a hero in a skintight suit with a giant pterodactylesque head and huge, inflatable rings for a parachute; incredibly strange special weapons, like the inflatable plastic decoy dummy that draws enemy fire and then explodes; and a massive array of different styles of rooms and levels, from a Hoth-like snow arena, to a psychedelic room with iridescent mirrored walls, to a creepy Romper Room whose primary-colored, paint-splattered platforms and vacant, dark crevices often line up to form eerie skull faces. MDK packs a punch in the style department. In execution, the flaws show, and you may wish they\'d traded a little of the game\'s visual inventiveness for some consistent graphical clarity. There\'s a ton of polygon dropout. And when things get busy, with dozens of onscreen enemies, projectiles, and explosions (which is in almost every scene), things slow way, way down, or animation frames disappear. Movement is smooth one minute and jerky and awkward the next.  <P>Gameplay is fast, with relatively loose control. Shooting is easy. At long range, just coming close with the chain gun is enough to take out most bad guys. This is good because most locations have dozens of enemies to take out. Many have generators that you must seek out first, since they\'re continually creating reinforcement troops on the spot. Jumping with any accuracy is awkward and never feels quite solid. Get used to it, though, because many of the game\'s puzzles involve jumping from platform to platform, or working your way up a series of jumps and airlifts, all while under fire from enemy guns. For the first few levels it\'s a real challenge to clear out room after room, all with completely different layouts and types of jumps. After a while, though, you realize that if you never stop shooting and strafing, your success is almost inevitable. If the battlefield is large enough, you don\'t even need to strafe back and forth, just hold R1 (strafe right), and press the D-pad left (to remain pointed at your target), and you\'ll literally run circles around your enemy, who\'s too stupid to adapt to this level of tactical virtuosity. Of course, when there\'s a gun turret or something, you\'ll need to switch into sniper mode to remedy the situation, but aside from that, the same pattern works for about 80 percent of combat. In short, the game gets easy quick. <P>The game\'s sniper mode is a lot of fun, even if it\'s ineffective in most circumstances. It\'s great when there\'s someone menacing you from such a distance that, in normal mode, he appears the size of a single pixel. Hit the select button to activate the mode, and zoom in to find that what appeared to be an innocuous curve in the scenery is actually a gun turret with someone inside, busily preparing megablasts to hurtle your way. The mode also has a ""bullet-cam"", which shows the scenery rushing by from the perspective of the projectiles you fire. This is great for lining up difficult long-range shots, since when you miss, you can easily pinpoint the exact spot you hit. Unfortunately, there are only three cameras, and you cannot fire a fourth shot until the first three land. This dramatically slows your rate of fire, especially with the chain gun. It\'s also difficult to move while in sniper mode - not just because it\'s hard to see what\'s around you, but your movement is actually slowed considerably - and since continually strafing is essentially the key to survival in the game, you\'ll probably only use it when there\'s a really powerful gun to take out. <P>Rounding out the game is an amazing soundtrack by the inimitable Tommy Tallarico Studios. This time around, Tommy\'s been very tasteful with the score, creating extremely dramatic music that could have come right out of Escape from Alcatraz, the Great Escape, or Escape from New York. Very cinematic, it lends a sense of urgency to each mission, and there are no shredding guitar solos. The other sound effects, especially the whimpering complaints of your alien enemies, are awesome, too. <P>In all, MDK is something of a mixed bag. Amazing graphics style, but little graphical consistency. Awesome combat action, but little combat challenge. Great puzzles, but they\'re really pretty simple, and the whole game can be solved without using too many brain cells. You\'ve got to hand it to Shiny, though, for consistently trying to come up with something different. --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Stalk track and fight in an expansive 3-D environment where natural selection is the only law. Hunt or be hunted!', 'The Lost World movie captivated audiences with a nonstop action-packed story that had the perfect blend of fun and fright. Unfortunately, The Lost World video game is an action-packed 3D platform game that has a perfect blend of frustration and frustration. <P>The frustration for most will begin as soon as you turn the game on because on the back of the game\'s box it says in really big letters: ""You\'re The T-Rex."" The whole truth is you only get to be the T-Rex for seven of the 30 levels. In fact, you must run around for a third of the game as a Compsognathus (Compy for short), which is a dinosaur about the size of a chicken. <P>The game has a total of five different characters. The first of which has you go through nine tedious levels of platform jumping as the Compy. Once you are tired of being fodder, you must blast your way through six levels as a human hunter who always seems to run out of ammo. The next five levels are played as the infamous Raptor, who is not nearly as tough in the game as she was in the movie. So, finally, after 20 levels, you get to be the T-Rex for a meager seven levels, although it\'s still pretty cool to be the king lizard. Last but not least, you get to run for your life through three levels as the human prey while various predators give chase. <P>Visually, The Lost World is above par. Although a great deal of the game looks average, some of the later levels look amazing. The characters and environments all comprise 3D polygons that look mighty smooth. Some of the game\'s animation looks as good as the movie. <P>The sound is definitely one of the few reasons you will enjoy playing The Lost World. At any moment when you\'re playing as the T-Rex, you can do the roar that raises the hair on the back of your neck. The music that accompanies the action is an amazing full orchestra that was put together just for the game. The whole soundtrack is very theatrical. <P>Aesthetically, The Lost World has all its dinos in a row. It\'s with gameplay - where it counts - that The Lost World fails. Even though the graphics are 3D, the gameplay is still that of a standard side scroller. Sure, it uses some neat camera tricks, similar to Crystal Dynamics\' Pandemonium, but it comes off as very confining in The Lost World. <P>Besides the control issues, there are several things that happen when playing that make you want to rip your hair out. For instance, when your character travels behind an object and your view is obstructed, an enemy character is almost always strategically positioned so you can\'t see when it\'s attacking you. And as if that isn\'t annoying enough, if you try to back up and lure the enemy from behind the tree or whatever is blocking your view, another enemy will be spawned. <P>The Lost World is one of those annoying, difficult platform games that makes you feel like cheating every time you die. Rent this one first before picking it up, and if you get horribly disgusted with it, use our level codes to check out a few of the cool later levels. --Ryan MacDonald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Unfortunately for fans of the series, including myself, ShootOut 98 no longer has the magic of the first two. The core features that were in the previous ShootOuts, such as the amazingly fun and intuitive gameplay, beautiful graphics, and realistic NBA action have been compromised. Apparently Sony had to make room on the disc for all of the new play control features and dunking animations because in certain situations, the game slows down. This actually affects gameplay since what was once an unconscious thought of running from point A to point B has to now be factored in with the varying speed of the game. But since it\'s fairly random and you have no warning or no idea how long it lasts, it\'s hard to deal with it.  If that\'s not bad enough, the control seems a little sloppier this year, too. The gameplay is frustratingly bad, rife with rampant shot blocks and steals that seem to happen more often than a shot attempt. I say ""attempt"" because shooting a basket in ShootOut 98 is a whole lot harder than in any other basketball game I\'ve played - even the computer has trouble. There is one surefire way to make a shot though: the spin button. New to the game is a spin button that allows you to virtually spin through any defender in your path. With that you can get as close to the basket as you want. Once there, ShootOut 98 features more ways to make a basket than any other basketball game on the PlayStation. It has leaners, fadeaways, hooks, tip-ins, alley-oops, and its all-new total-control dunking system, which is just like the direct dunking of NBA Live 98 in that you can select which dunk you want to perform as you go up for the slam. Another new feature that\'s kind of cool is icon cutting. With this you can direct any of your teammates toward the basket at any time when you\'re on offense by simply pushing their specific button. On defense you now have a similar feature that allows you to choose the defender that you wish, with the specific button method as well. These new features might sound all well and good, but with the buttons that you have to push to make them work, you\'ll feel like you\'re typing rather than playing a game of hoops. If it weren\'t for the bad colliding sound effects of the players and the still annoying announcer, I could say that the sound is almost perfect. In some cases the sound effects are the only way to tell what\'s happening. Of the six camera angles supplied in the game, three are tolerable - the beloved action camera from the first two games just doesn\'t track the action like it used to. In fact, a couple camera selections immediately switch to the opposite end of the court after a missed free throw leaving you only guessing at what events unfolded underneath the basket.  Compared with other basketball titles out this year, ShootOut 98 is at the bottom of the pile. The problems that plague it make the game downright unplayable. You\'re better off with any of the other basketball games out there, including last year\'s ShootOut.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.
