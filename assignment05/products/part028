The setup is so well thought out that setting up several modes at the same time can be done quickly and easily during gameplay without interruption. The Z-750 does not have any external drilled out buttons or protruding LEDs, it's appearance is identical to a stock controller when the mods are not in use. When the modes are in use, there are two ultra cool blue embedded indicator LEDs to let you know where you are at all times. The controller does not offer an aimbot mode for online game play that exploited the auto-lock glitch of several console revisions ago, but that is a mode that none of us will see again in any controller mod. The BlackZone Z-750 does offer an AutoAim function that automatically aims down the sight or through your scope upon right trigger fire, a function that is very useful with all weapons, especially when used in combination with DropShot and RapidFire. A good example would be an MK14 on RapidFire with a thermal sight setup for AutoAim. The Z-750 is light on complexity for ease of use and solid on functionality. The versatility and ease of use during gameplay make this an excellent modded controller.""]","by

The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 33 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series\' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.<br><br> The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society.<br><br> These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.<br><br> The Legacy Collection includes Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2, Metal Gear Solid 2: HD Edition, Metal Gear Solid 3: HD Edition, Metal Gear Solid 4 Trophy Edition and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker HD Edition<br>Also includes Metal Gear Solid 1 and Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions via included voucher codes<br>92+ Average Metacritic Rating for all games']",Konami,['>#936 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)'],$24.25,Video Games,B00KTZELMY

It tells the compelling story of a civilization that lost their planet and has been roaming the edge of space for 2000 years in search of a new home. In Ar Nosurge: Ode to an Unborn Star, the player follows two sets of characters: Delta and Casty, whose goal is to protect humanity and save the world, and Ion & Earthes, who are trying to find Ion a way home to Earth. The player can interchange between both pairs and soon discover a way to combine their storylines and strengths to eventually solve the mystery that shrouds their ongoing struggle. Developed by Gust, Ar Nosurge: Ode to an Unborn Star is an intricately deep turn-based RPG and includes a detailed synthesis system for players to create their own items. A unique character development system focuses more on the bonds and relationships between the main characters than their success in missions and battles, with the player's party growing stronger if the characters have a closer relationship. Additionally, character pairs fight together during battles in Ar Nosurge: Ode to an Unborn Star. One is always the first line of defense, attacking enemies in melee with knives and swords while protecting the other, who is weaving a song to fend off enemies. The longer the song lasts the more damage it creates- not only to enemies visible on screen, but to ones that are in line to attack.""]","by

Proven a winner time and again, the FPS Freek has been praised by numerous professionals, enthusiasts and n00bs alike. By increasing the length of the analog thumbsticks slightly, precision while aiming is improved dramatically. Your range of motion is increased by 40%, giving you the opportunity to make smaller adjustments and ""snap"" to targets much faster in first-person shooters. This affords you the luxury of turning up controller thumbstick sensitivities to get the closest feel to a mouse possible on a console without an internal controller mod or cheat. The greater leverage offers you better control and less force-alleviating thumb-fatigue and adding more comfort to long gaming sessions.

All but two teams have changed their driver line-ups and new circuits have been added to the roster. Players will experience how 2014's radically different new cars feel to drive and how race strategy has changed as the season, cars, circuits and teams are authentically recreated. F1 2014 also delivers a range of new gameplay modes and enhancements to create the most accessible FORMULA 1 video game from Codemasters to date. A new driver evaluation system quickly identifies a gamer's ability and tunes game settings to an appropriate level, whilst regraded difficulty settings enable players to compete at incrementally higher levels as they become more experienced. The new Very Easy difficulty level is the most accessible yet for new players and a range of shorter game modes and career options cater for absolute novices who simply want a fun and quick race. At the other end of the spectrum, experienced gamers who enjoy a more serious simulation of the demands placed upon FORMULA ONE drivers can customize their settings to provide a true challenge. Expanded game modes, new career options and multiplayer modes extended by RaceNet further enhance F1 2014's recreation of the world of FORMULA ONE for long-established fans and newcomers to the series.""]","by

At the other end of the spectrum, experienced gamers who enjoy a more serious simulation of the demands placed upon FORMULA ONE drivers can customize their settings to provide a true challenge.

Thanks to iOS 7, developers can now code incredible games for iOS devices with the classic console control schemes we have used for decades. Stratus Wireless takes advantage of this breakthrough like no other controller on the market, joining Apple in bringing the revolution to light. The Stratus feels familiar right out of the box. This helps make the transition to mobile gaming a seamless one. The face buttons (4), shoulder buttons (4), analog sticks (2), and D-pad were all designed to provide that console-like vibe. \n\nThe Stratus Wireless is small enough to be portable, but big enough to easily hold and maneuver. SteelSeries engineered the controller with pressure sensitive buttons for the ultimate in analog control. The shoulder buttons, face buttons and the D-pad all feature pressure sensitivity making them as precise as possible depending how much force is applied.\n\nThere are plenty of titles in the App Store that already support the Stratus Wireless and hundreds (maybe even thousands) more on the way. From big-name blockbuster franchises like Grand Theft Auto, down to the newest indie games, the development world is all over this expanding market.  In supported titles, up to four players can game on one screen.  LED lighting on the top of the controller indicates player number to easily keep tabs on whose turn it is. Play solo or get connected with others, Stratus Wireless makes it effortless to do both. \n\nBluetooth 2.1 makes connecting the Stratus Wireless controller a snap and also provides extended battery life. Play for 10 hours and recharge with the included USB charger in only 2.\nPLEASE NOTE: This device requires iOS 7 and is ONLY compatible with the following devices: iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5\niPad mini, iPad Air, iPad 4th Generation\niPod Touch (5th Generation)', 'Amazon Renewed is your trusted destination for pre-owned and refurbished products that are inspected and tested to work and look like new.

Wasteland 2 is the direct sequel to 1988's Wasteland, the first-ever post-apocalyptic computer RPG and the inspiration behind the Fallout series. Until Wasteland, no other CRPG had ever allowed players to control and command individual party members for tactical purposes or given them the chance to make moral choices that would directly affect the world around them. Wasteland was a pioneer in multi-path problem solving, dripping in choice and consequence and eschewing the typical one-key-per-lock puzzle solving methods of its peers, in favor of putting the power into players' hands to advance based on their own particular play style. The Wasteland series impressive and innovative lineage has been preserved at its very core, but modernized for the fans of today with Wasteland 2. Immerse yourself in turn-based tactical combat that will test the very limits of your strategy skills as you fight to survive a desolate world where brute strength alone isn't enough to save you. Deck out your Ranger squad with the most devastating weaponry this side of the fallout zone and get ready for maximum destruction with the RPG-style character advancement and customization that made the first Wasteland so brutal.
