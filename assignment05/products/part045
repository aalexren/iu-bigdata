You will need to pilot your ship, The Tempest, to the planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Earth in order to retrieve certain minerals which can be used to fight the Raggosians. The Raggosians will be trying to stop you from reaching these destinations, though, so you need to use the Nintendo zapper to fight back. Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire. Occasionally you can also earn a smart bomb which appears in the bottom of the screen and destroys all enemies if shot. Each level ends with a large boss which will take multiple hits to destroy.""]",Nintendo,"['>#39,371 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)']",$10.99,Video Games,B000IYYHN4

It is a journey into the land of Mordavia - a setting influenced by Eastern Europe, particularly its Slavic areal. The hero had just begun to enjoy his victory in Tarna, when a spell zapped him into parts unknown, without a weapon, items, or even a source of light. Shortly after finding his way out of the dark cave, the hero meets a mysterious woman named Katrina. He traverses the swamps in the dark forest and finally reaches the town. However, the town is also engulfed by a foreboding atmosphere, and the hero cannot allow himself to relax. He must find out what is going on, why the town inhabitants are so hesitant and reluctant to help him, and what horrors are lurking outside of its walls. Life has never been quite so dangerous for our hero. He'll discover his quest soon enough - that is, if he lives.\n\nLike the previous Quest For Glory titles, the game is a combination of puzzle-solving adventure and role-playing. The player character can be a fighter, a thief, a magician, or a paladin. Importing a character from a preceding installment of the series is also possible. Once again the hero improves his skills by repeatedly using them (like throwing stones at a tree to improve the throwing ability, which might be needed to solve a puzzle).""]",,"3,736,911 in Books (",$3.95,Books,B000K7BS2W

Filled with vulgarities, traps and disgusting monsters, the dungeon is a very dangerous place. With his enemies gone, the Baron now has opened up the dungeon to sport and sends willing heroes down into it's depths, betting on the likelihood of their survival. If anyone could survive all levels of the dungeon, and slay the red dragon Melkor, they would receive 10.000 gold pieces and Baron Sukumvit would renounce his rule over Fang. Two brave heroes: Red Lotus and Bandog, agree to these terms and enter the Deathtrap Dungeon.<br>  Deathtrap Dungeon is a 3rd person action game. Controlling either Red Lotus or Bandog, the player controls the character from behind with a camera mode like in Tomb Raider. To deal with the enemies encountered, there are three different kinds of attacks: melee weapons, range weapons and magic. The melee weapons include basic fists to normal swords to a magic enhanced war hammer. In the range weapons department are goodies like bombs or a flame-thrower. In terms of spells are magicks such as fireballs or rather crazy spells like the exploding pig. But the real challenge are of course the riddles, traps and abysses that are everywhere throughout the dungeon. <br>  During the journey, players will encounter many locked doors, that require the finding of keys and devices. There are also potions that regenerate health or provide immunity against fire for a limited amount of time.

Pick the type of tires you want, change your gear ratios, adjust the air dam, and more. When you think you're ready to go, head out for three qualifying laps which will determine your starting place for the main event. Don't skip it or you'll wind up starting out at the back of the pack.\n\nOnce the race is under way on one of 12 custom-designed courses, you can cycle through the views outside your car and decide when to come in for a pit stop.

Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['A realistic new bowling simulation, <i>Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling</i> features Brunswick personalities, tournaments, state-of the-art equipment, and family fun. Choose from among 13 of your favorite Brunswick Pro Staff bowlers and hit the lanes in a true 3-D simulation, utilizing advanced physics engines for some exciting pin action.', ""Bowling. A sport that depends more on talent and raw wrist power than actual physical conditioning. A sport that can be so laid back that there's even a section of it that involves buying beer. While THQ can't bring you a six-pack should you throw a strike on the seventh frame, it does manage to deliver an extremely realistic bowling title, complete with some of the best big-money bowlers in the world today. <P> To start, you can create your own bowler or simply choose one of the 13 Brunswick Pro Staff bowlers in the game. Each bowler has a little video clip (similar to THQ's wrestling game, WCW Nitro) that proclaims how much of a badass he is. These clips provide the most hilarious gaming moments in recent memory. Each video is chock-full of bad reads, funny-looking bowler types, and poorly conveyed braggadocio. <P> There are a few different gameplay modes to choose from. Exhibition games get you going quickly, with no strings attached. Just pick a bowler and get on with it. Other modes include the skins game, the tournament, career mode, and cosmic bowling, which turns the lanes into a discotheque. The lane is realistically oiled, which forces you to move around the lane and vary your rolls as conditions change, but this doesn't really make the game terribly hard. Expect to bowl around 150 within your first two games. <P> The graphics are much more than you'd expect from a bowling game. There are tons of different camera angles, which are automatically selected on each roll of the ball. The players look like their real-life counterparts and are fairly well animated. The music in Brunswick is surprisingly good. The music changes on each frame. The sound effects are also very well done. <P> All in all, Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling is a pretty good game. It isn't the type of game you'll play every day, unless you're some kind of bowling nut. Even if you aren't a bowling fan, and couldn't care less about this game, you really should see the video clips at least once. They're incredibly funny. <i>--Jeff Gerstmann</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

For the last year Aerosoft has been working on a high detail model of this aircraft and now you will see the Fighting Falcon fly into the virtual world of FSX. \n\n\nThe F-16 Fighting Falcon is a multirole jet fighter build by General Dynamics for the US Air Force. The lightweight fighter became the ubiquities fighter as it was exported to 25 nations and a record breaking production of over 4,400 aircraft. Updated every decade it remains the basic fighter for nations worldwide. Apart from being a very serious fighter it remains about the most enjoyable aircraft to fly with the superb maneuverability and power that allows vertical climbs. Visibility is unparalleled in the frameless bubble canopy. This enjoyment remains fully intact in FSX. \n\nThe Aerosoft version includes the most used versions in the highest possible detail. With close to half a million vertices it most likely is the most detailed aircraft ever designed for FSX. The realism of this product is great that parts of the product are sold to professional users and is used in the first stages of training of pilots in 3 countries. Where other internally developed aircraft try to merge all existing models into one 'universal' model, the F-16 was designed with pure realism in mind, down to the smallest detail each of the 21 models is as the real aircraft patrols the skies. In FSX the F-16 is a joy to fly, with the controllability of a light aircraft and capable of altitudes of 50.000 feet and speeds exceeding Mach1. It is extremely agile yet easy to control (it will fly where you point the nose) it allows you to explore the environment of FSX like never before.""]",F-16 Fighting Falcon (FSX),"['>#99,493 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#13,227 in Video Games > PC Games > PC Games']",,Video Games,B000MQX8CO

The Cosmic Ark races to save creatures from doomed planets in that solar system. Meteor showers bombard the Ark, threatening its Atlantean crew - and planetary defense systems make this mission of mercy doubly treacherous! Time and energy slip away - work fast or these defenseless little beasties will disappear for all time. The Cosmic Ark has travelled thousands of light years in order to preserve the many exotic species peculiar to the Alpha Ro solar system. When that sun novas, life on planets there will wither and die. Nothing about this mission is easy. Heavy meteor activity throughout the system makes travel hazardous. And each planet has an automatic defense system that cannot be knocked out. Can the Ark succeed in saving the many helpless creatures of Alpha Ro? Can the Cosmic Ark survive? How many planets can you reach? GAME OBJECTIVE: Pilot the Cosmic Ark through dangerous territory. Destroy meteors that come too close. You score each time you eliminate a meteor. If you survive the meteor shower, launch a shuttleship to the surface of each planet. Try to capture 2 skittish beasties in your tractor beam in order to gain fuel and points. Be quick about it! Return to the Ark before it undergoes another meteor barrage. But be careful  automatic planetary defense systems attempt to disable the shuttleship, releasing your precious cargo before you can safely transport them to the Ark. Reach as many planets as your fuel reserves allow. Game ends when you've exhausted your store of fuel.""]","by

Although Surface Thunder retreads old ground yet again, packing ANOTHER port of classic Battleship in, it's not the main attraction this season. Despite the simple, yet wholly satisfying fun and great graphics of this mini-game, it's the all-new action shooter that's loosely based around the product's naval theme which'll be captivating your attention. Essentially, what owners are buying into is a family oriented diversion that offers something for mom and pop as well as the pizza-faced, hyperactive, Limp Bizkit worshipping fruit of their loins.\n\nHonestly, anyone that can, in good conscience, refer to themself as a lifelong gamer has played this game before, albeit under a gajillion different names and costumes. As the captain of a lone battleship stuck deep within the boundaries of hostile waters, you've got to blast your way out. On the bright side, the little steel juggernaut can spit cannonfire from its portside and starboard bows, as well as from the front and rear. That said, you'll have to deftly pilot your way through the nooks and crannies of several missions' maps, working four fire buttons as fast as humanly possible to wipe out an onslaught of enemy carriers, PT boats, subs, biplanes, zeppelins, and sea serpents before the day is won.

Featuring the image and voice of action star Vin Diesel as undercover agent and driver for hire Milo Burik, in an entirely digital performance, <i>Wheelman</i> was originally planned as a launching pad for a new movie franchise of the same name. Until then, <i>Wheelman</i> the video game will stand as a brash celebration of car chases and on-screen collisions that do not need a movie to keep you on the edge of your seat. <p/> <b>Open World Gameplay and <i>Wheelman</i> Moves</b><br/> First and foremost <i>Wheelman</i> is a driving game, but in its open world gameplay universe players can go anywhere, whether behind the wheel or on foot. As with other open world games, action is split between mission play, event and freeplay, with the breakdown working out to about 80% of it taking place behind the wheel or on motorcycles, to 20% while on foot. Also, <i>Wheelman</i> features fully destructible environments, which allows players take advantage of special in-game features, known as <i>\'Wheelman</i> Moves.\' Designed to illustrate the game\'s philosophy which considers vehicles as the ultimate weapons, these features include the Vehicle Melee mode, which allows for quick and devastating vehicle sideswiping attacks; Airjacking, which allows you to jump from car to car while attacking without having to stop your vehicle as in other open world games; and the Cyclone and Aimed Shot with which players can perform devastating feats of ballistic accuracy while on the move.<p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Vin Diesel Is <i>The Wheelman</i></b> - Action film megastar Vin Diesel and his Tigon Studios are again blurring the lines between entertainment mediums, this time collaborating with Midway in the design and production of <i>Wheelman</i> to ensure an edge-of-your-seat gaming experience. Diesel&rsquo;s voice and likeness will appear as the game&rsquo;s main character, expert Wheelman Milo Burik.</li> <li><b>The Ultimate Thrill Ride</b> - Designed to play like a Hollywood blockbuster, <i>Wheelman</i> delivers all the rubber-burning, asphalt-churning excitement of the most jaw-dropping high-speed car chases.</li> <li><b>Open World Driving</b> - Go where you want, do what you want, however you want. Choose your own route through the living, breathing city of Barcelona as you complete more than 30 missions and 100 side-missions, or simply drive around and take in the breathtaking Spanish architecture as you seek out all the game&rsquo;s hidden cinematic jumps and golden lion statues.</li> <li><b>Revolutionary Car Combat</b> - Sideswipe pursuing enemies with <i>Wheelman</i>&rsquo;s groundbreaking Vehicle Melee car combat. Execute devastating ""slam-n-ram"" maneuvers in all directions with a simple flick of the joystick. But be careful, because your enemies can do the same. Once you experience <i>Wheelman</i>&rsquo;s Vehicle Melee, you&rsquo;ll never want to play another driving game without it.</li> <li><b>Maximum Mobility</b> - Escape down a narrow alleyway on the back of a tricked-out motorcycle. Drive through an office building to make your getaway. Hop behind the wheel of exclusively licensed vehicles like the Pontiac G8 and Saturn Astra and make your escape in style. Drive it. Trash it. Crash it. You&rsquo;re the <i>Wheelman</i>, it&rsquo;s all up to you.</li> <li><b>Living, Breathing Barcelona</b> - Set in the exotic location of Barcelona, Spain. This classic European city is densely populated with traffic and pedestrians that react intelligently to your actions as you roam around realistic environments filled with massively destructible objects.</li> <li><b>Cinematic Signature Stunts</b> - Survive death-defying feats and perform pulse-pounding moves to trigger extreme over-the-top Hollywood-style mobile attack maneuvers including <ul> <li>Aimed Shot - Drive and shoot at the same time while the rest of the world slows to an easy-to-target blur.</li> <li>The Air Jack - Leap from moving car to moving car to take control of a brand new ride.</li> <li>The 360&deg; Cyclone Spin: Spin around 180&deg; to take out anyone that&rsquo;s behind you, and then spin back 180&deg; again to resume your route.</li> </ul></li> <li><b>Hit the Pavement</b> - Even the best Wheelman sometimes needs to get out of the vehicle. Take to the Barcelona streets for on-foot action &mdash; but make sure to remember your guns.</li> </ul> <b>Experience Spain Like You Never Expected</b><br/> Barcelona, Spain - the cultural capital of Europe - known for its famous Goudi architecture, provides a cosmopolitan and unique backdrop for <i>Wheelman</i>. Lovingly re-created as the perfect environment for <i>Wheelman</i>\'s incredible car chases - the city is filled with traffic, pedestrians and plenty of massive destruction. The realistic environment, authentic vehicles and the ambient sound and music contribute to create an immersive and believable game world unlike any other. <p/>']","by

You can make complex player trades and sign players to multi-year contracts as you build your team, but you'll have to compete with the other General Managers, and negotiate with the player's agents. Baseball Mogul also lets you manage the finances for your ball club. Raise revenue by setting the price of tickets and concessions, and selling the TV broadcast rights, while you manage the budget for your farm system, player scouts, medical staff, and player payroll. But be careful, because fans can be fickle if you don't win or you raise ticket prices! If you don't succeed in your first year, you get a new chance with Baseball Mogul's in-depth amateur draft. Pick and choose from the best high school and college talent around the world. If your new players are good enough, have them join your team right away, otherwise send them to your minor league franchise for training and improvement. But Baseball Mogul doesn't stop at the front office. You have complete control over your team on the field. Set the lineup and pitching rotation for your team. On game day, you choose your level of involvement. Retire to the luxury box and make calls to the dugout as needed. Or take control of each player, choosing what pitches to throw and when to bunt or go for an extra base. A powerful game engine simulates each pitch of the game based on customized player ratings and over 100 years of historical data, assuring you the maximum realism possible!""]","by

Target in Sight joins Bandai's popular series of games based on the Mobile Suit Gundam anime, and features a scenario set during the last days of the famed One Year War. Players can join either the Federation or the Principality of Zeon, and are put in charge of their own Mobile Suit battalion, consisting of Mobile Suits from the original Mobile Suit Gundam, The 08th MS Team, and more. Gameplay is similar to previous games in the series, requiring the player to take on enemy mobile suits in full 3-D environments. Defeating foes on the battlefield and winning campaigns allows access to better Mobile Suits and more skilled pilots. In between campaigns, players must maintain their Mobile Suits, attending to repairs, hiring new pilots, and purchasing new weapons. Environments are now more destructible, with more realistic physics applied. Thanks to the PS3's superior graphics processors, the Mobile Suit in-game models now look better than ever, with gritty, detailed textures that make the giant robots seem more realistic and battle-worn.""]","by

Heli-Carrier, and more as they guide a four-person party through 17 comic book-inspired locales. Moves include a flurry of air and ground strikes, from grapples and blocks to chargeable powers and deadly combos. Objects within the environment can also cause damage, and a choice of one- and two-handed weapons can help less extraordinary heroes mete out justice against throngs of enemies.\n\nAs players decide on which heroes to enlist in their super group, including such iconic characters as Spider-Man, Wolverine, The Thing, Captain America, Elektra, and Thor, they can customize their team's name, icon, and vehicle. The party's reputation will increase over time through heroic deeds and by successfully completing mission objectives, allowing players the opportunity to further enhance the team's or a specific character's attributes. The cast includes more than 140 comic book characters in total, many of which are available in the single-player storyline and can be unlocked for multiplayer action. The latter supports both cooperative and competitive battles, with in-game statistics tracked for each team as they earn experience points and receive powerful new equipment. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance also features unlockable bonus content, such as alternate costumes that modify a character's base statistics in the areas of defense, melee damage, and so forth.""]","by

If <i>Vacancy</i> doesn't quite live up to its Hitchcockian forbears, at least it provides 80 minutes of well-designed mayhem. You know somebody's paying attention just from the opening credits, a clever vortex with pounding music by Paul Haslinger. Then we meet unhappy couple Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale, driving along in the dark and forced to stay at the Pinewood Motel after a car breakdown. There's a night man (Frank Whaley, decadent) in the tradition of Dennis Weaver's <i>Touch of Evil</i> gargoyle, but the real mess of trouble is waiting in room number 4. Director Nimrod Antal, who scored a stylish international hit with the Hungarian thriller <i>Kontroll</i>, squeezes maximum juice out of the Route 66 atmosphere of the motel, although the movie doesn't get under your skin the way <i>Kontroll</i> did. Wilson and Beckinsale are a little too marquee-namish for this kind of heavy-breathing work, and the script doesn't give them much to play with. But hey, it's not that kind of movie. Where it really belongs is on the top half of a drive-in double bill, or maybe as a nightmare-scenario TV movie from the Seventies. Either way, it works. --<i>Robert Horton</i>"", '', '', '', '', '<span class=""h1""><strong>Stills from <i>Vacancy</i> (click for larger image)</strong></span> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""4"" width=""100%"" cellspacing=""4"">', '', '<tr align=""center"" valign=""top""> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/sony/vacancy/Vaclrg._V30632188_.jpg""><img border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/sony/vacancy/Vacsmal._V30632188_.jpg""><br> </a></td>', '<td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/sony/vacancy/Vac2lrg._V30632191_.jpg""><img border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/sony/vacancy/Vac2sml._V30632191_.jpg""><br> </a></td> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/sony/vacancy/Vac3lrg._V30632190_.jpg""><img border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/sony/vacancy/Vac3sml._V30632190_.jpg""><br> </a></td>', '</tr> <tr align=""center"" valign=""top""> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/sony/vacancy/Vac4lrg._V30632185_.jpg""><img border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/sony/vacancy/Vac4sml._V30632185_.jpg""><br> </a></td> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/sony/vacancy/Vac5lrg._V30632184_.jpg""><img border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/sony/vacancy/Vac5sml._V30632187_.jpg""><br> </a></td> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/sony/vacancy/Vac6lrg._V30632074_.jpg""><img border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/sony/vacancy/Vac6sml._V30632069_.jpg""><br> </a></td> </a></td>', '</tr> </table>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '<span class=""h1""><strong>More <I> Vacancy </I> on Amazon.com</strong></span>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '<table cellpadding=""4"" border=""0"" width=""100%"" cellspacing=""4""> <tr class=""tiny"" valign=""top"" align=""center"">', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '<td><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000RGN2JI/ref=d_ap_vac_1""><img border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B000RGN2JI.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg""><br> Vacancy on DVD</a></td>', '', '', '', '', '', '<td><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/190113007X/ref=d_ap_vac_2""><img border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/190113007X.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg""><br> Avoid Travel Disasters</a></td>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '<td><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009UZGDW/ref=d_ap_vac_3""><img border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B0009UZGDW.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg""><br> By the Director</a></td>', '', '', '', '</tr> </table>']","by
