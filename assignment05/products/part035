What about where to aim on those quartering-away shots? Where should you aim to hit the heart? All of these questions can be answered with Cyber Deer. Additionally, while the Cyber Deer program will allow you to take a shot from any angle you want to try, it will also tell you when a shot angle you chose is not advisable and less likely to be effective.\n\nVeteran hunters will benefit from Cyber Deer, and it will also be a fantastic tool for anyone teaching others about ethical hunting and effective shot placement, including parents teaching their children, mentors teaching new hunters, and hunter-education instructors.

Komodo Chess 8 - Multiprocessor version,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games']",,"[""Komodo is a chess program that is different from the rest. Its search makes greater use of extensions than any other top engine, which allows Komodo to often see deeper than any other engine, even if it is displaying a slightly lower search depth. The evaluation differs from its main rivals because it represents a blend of both automated tuning and the judgment of a grandmaster and computer expert (Larry Kaufman). Fully automated evaluations are subject to rather large sample error, and applying some chess judgment appears to be beneficial, both in results and in the reasonableness of reported evaluations. Komodo is primarily known for superb positional play. Of course it also one of the the top few engines in tactical strength, but the programmers have not been willing to sacrifice positional play just to score better on tactical problem sets. All good engines are far stronger tactically than any human player, but that when positional judgment is involved, top grandmasters are still superior. Therefore it makes sense to emphasize positional play rather than tactical skill; it is better to improve one's weakest point rather than just to further improve the strongest feature. Komodo is especially useful for opening analysis, because its grandmaster programmer has always made sure that the program's evaluations agree in general with accepted theory. Komodo also excels in the evaluation of positions with material imbalance, which it handles more correctly than other top engines. The endgame of Komodo has been improved by the use of Syzygy tablebases, which provide only the most essential information to save time and memory. Another unique feature of Komodo is its superior performance when using eight or more cores. There is little doubt that Komodo 8 will be the top rated commercial chess engine on most rating lists."", '', '']",Learn more,"297,050 in Movies &amp; TV (",,Movies &amp; TV,3866814429

In single player mode, you can play the Ninja challenge, which pits you against a clan of mysterious evil Ninjas. If you unlock enough areas in the Ninja Challenge, you can choose a character and jump into the single player Miniseries challenge, which has unique tasks for each character. If you opt for multiplayer, youve got the 12 level Championship game, where up to four human players can duke it out. There are also Battle Game, Freestyle, and Rehearsal modes, which can be played in either single or multiplayer. \n\nThe graphics and music are decent, not extraordinary. The game has a fun deformed-cartoon style, and the music includes both the theme from Enter the Dragon and Kung Fu Fighting. The voice acting is good too, especially during cut scenes and when characters taunt each other. The frame right stays smooth no matter how many characters are on the screen, which is good, but sometimes there is so much fast action on the screen (especially during multiplayer play), that you can easily lose track of your character.']","by

GRAND THEFT AUTO SAN ANDREAS,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation 2']","{'Paperback:': '240 pages', 'Publisher:': 'Ayrinti Yayinlari; Standard edition (2005)', 'Language:': 'Turkish', 'ISBN-10:': '975539463X', 'ISBN-13:': '978-9755394633', '\n    Product Dimensions: \n    ': '7.5 x 0.6 x 5.1 inches', 'Shipping Weight:': '6.4 ounces'}","['<div id=""1upReviewInfo""> <b>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</b>', '<em>By John Davison</em> -- 25/10/2004', 'San Andreas is very different from other games, though. It is a very big game. The term ""big"" really doesn\'t do it justice. It\'s huge, massive, colossal, stupendous, and somewhat humbling in its enormity. No matter what expectations you\'ve developed based on the information that has dribbled out over the course of the past six months, you are wrong. If you\'re expecting <strong>Vice City</strong>, only set in the \'90s and with some RPG bits, you are wrong. If you believe they can\'t possibly push it as much as they have before, that it can\'t really be that good, you are wrong. San Andreas is shocking, not necessarily because of its typically contentious subject matter (though there\'s plenty in it to rub those of a conservative disposition the wrong way) but because of the sheer scale of the experience.', 'There are so many facets to the experience, I can\'t possibly describe them all here, but I will attempt to outline what makes San Andreas such a significant game. Based on my progress for the OPM exclusive, you could extrapolate that it would take about 72 hours to score 100 percent. This would, of course, be true if the game were a completely linear experience. It\'s not. Much like <strong>GTA3</strong> and Vice City, you can ""beat"" the game by completing only the core missions that progress the story. There are people at Rockstar I\'ve spoken to who have finished the main story but have completed less than 60 percent of the entire game. By just plodding through the story, though, you\'re going to miss a lot. Conservatively, I would guess that there\'s definitely more than 100 hours of gameplay here if you want to do everything. The notion of a ""digital sandbox"" was bandied around quite liberally in the past in association with this franchise, but never has it been so apt. The game world is so rich and so packed with surprises that the enjoyment of just existing within it is its own reward.', 'Aside from its size, the other immediately apparent thing about the game is that it looks infinitely superior to Vice City. Environments are rich with detail and packed with effects, whether they are beautiful sunrises bleaching out your view or huge storms breaking with rain as thunder and lightning crashes overhead. <p align=""center""> <table bgcolor=""#666666"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""540""> <tr> <td> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""8"" cellspacing=""1"" width=""540""> <tr> <td bgcolor=""#ffffff""> <img align=""left"" height=""224"" hspace=""10"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/partner/1up/reviews/1265187"" vspace=""5"" width=""320"">', '<span style=""color:#666666; font-weight:bold; font-size:14px; font-family:verdana;""> Territorial Spray </span>', ""Well, it's <i>one</i> of the new collectibles, anyway... </span> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>"", ""The first eight or nine hours of the game take place in Los Santos and are very gang focused. You are very quickly drawn into the gangbanger experience, and there's a gritty, almost squalid feel to it at first. It's a very reactionary experience, and you soon start to develop feelings for the gang members you're working with. There are some characters you like and others you don't, and the action unfolds in the tried and trusted GTA fashion. Multiple threads open up that pull you through the linear story, but they are presented in such a way that the illusion of freedom is always very pronounced. The first couple of hours introduce you to the most obvious gameplay features, as well as some of the key players in the story."", ""Very early on, you'll notice that the combat system has been improved. If you've played <strong>Manhunt</strong>, you'll know pretty much what to expect. Shooting is done with the aid of a lock-on system, as is hand-to-hand combat, and the lock-on is, for the most part, fairly reliable. Tap R1 to get a lock and then hit L1 to open fire. It's fast and effective, and it rarely devolves to the frustrating depths that you no doubt experienced if you played Vice City."", ""Also, by the end of your second hour, you will have started to put your mark on your own personal CJ. You'll have been introduced to the barbershop, the clothes stores, the tattoo shop, and the gym, as well as the restaurants in your neighborhood. That's enough to be either fat or skinny, well dressed or a slob. You can even sport a huge moustache, if you're so inclined. You'll also start to notice that you're forming quite a bond with the game's hero. Examine this emotion further and you'll touch on one of the least quantifiable, but arguably most significant, aspects of San Andreas, CJ himself. Without wishing to get all beard-strokey and film studenty, I think it has to be said that CJ is possibly one of the most well-developed and believable videogame characters ever made. He's not a caricature, he's not a superhero, he's not a lone warrior out for justice: He's just a guy. Sure, he's a criminal, and he has a propensity for being particularly unpleasant, but very quickly, you start to notice that you really like him. It's not the same way you like Sam Fisher or Solid Snake or Ratchet, there's not the detachment that you have with those guys. With CJ, you like him because you very quickly start to feel like you really know him. Part of this is because of Young Maylay's surprisingly fantastic performance as CJ, but it's mostly because his reactions are credible. When he's making smartass remarks, they're casual and not forced. When he's dealing with a crazy character, his discomfort is tangible, and when you factor all of this in with your ownership of every facet of his development, you really start to notice a bond forming. By the time you leave Los Santos at around the nine-hour point, a lot of things have happened. The gang activities have escalated to a point where they're becoming almost oppressive, you will have experienced a number of set-pieces that are truly spectacular, and you will have touched on quite a few of San Andreas' gameplay styles. Running, driving, shooting, drive-bys, sneaking, and variations thereof will have been supplemented with some on-rails shooter sections, object collection, DDR-style dancing, Track & Field&#226;&#128;&#147;style button tapping, and several different kinds of racing. All of them are done in moderation, and none of them are so pronounced that you'll become frustrated. If you're lousy at rhythm games, you have to endure something of that style only twice in Los Santos. For me, bizarrely, the big hang-up was the racing. For someone obsessed with racing games, the fact that I struggled so badly with one of the major Midnight Club-esque races in the game utterly bewildered me. This was worsened by a returning GTA frustration -- the repetition involved if you keep messing up a mission. The race in question was against a Mexican gang using lowriders (not the best-handling cars in the game), and the process involved tracking down a lowrider, heading to Cesar's (CJ's sister's boyfriend's place), following him to the race location, and then entering the race and having to win. The race itself weaved through a considerably large part of the city, and if I made a mistake, I had to go all the way back to the beginning of that process. By my third attempt, it was starting to piss me off."", ""Once you leave Los Santos, you're actually quite glad to be away from all the gang-related crap that's going on. Being dumped out in the middle of nowhere in a small town in the countryside has a dramatic effect on the way you feel about the game, and the sense of being in the open air is actually quite refreshing. The missions in the wilderness have a very different vibe, and the characters you come across are far less intense (for the most part) than the bangers in Los Santos. Missions in the countryside vary from small-town bank jobs to torching an entire field of weed, and these are interspersed with a lot of off-roading over beautifully rendered landscapes. I spent about six hours working through the missions out there, and just as the game clock ticked over 15 hours, I was approaching San Fierro, and another major shift in terms of atmosphere."", 'There\'s a strong thread of humor running throughout the game, as there has been in every GTA, but you really start to notice it once you\'re traversing the hills of San Fierro. It\'s here that you encounter your geeky sidekick, Zero, voiced to perfection by David Cross, and his excruciatingly difficult side missions (remember the RC missions in Vice City? They\'re back, and they\'ll kick your ass). You\'ll also meet the Chinese triad boss Woozie (my favorite character in the game, in part thanks to the wonderful interplay between him and CJ) and Jizzy (voiced by Charlie ""I\'m Rick James, bitch"" Murphy), the proprietor of the strip club The Pleasure Domes. Your time in San Fierro feels somewhat more civilized than the time you spent in Los Santos, probably because you\'ve broken away from the gang scene to a certain extent and become much more of a player in the broader scheme of things. You now own property, and as you accumulate funds, you can buy a number of different places around the city that provide you with easily accessible safe houses, as well as new business opportunities. Your legitimacy is further compounded as you start to feel like you\'re taking a side in a much broader story. <p align=""center""> <table bgcolor=""#666666"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""540""> <tr> <td> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""8"" cellspacing=""1"" width=""540""> <tr> <td bgcolor=""#ffffff""> <img align=""left"" height=""224"" hspace=""10"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/partner/1up/reviews/1265190"" vspace=""5"" width=""320"">', '<span style=""color:#666666; font-weight:bold; font-size:14px; font-family:verdana;""> Family Business </span>', ""The core San Fierro missions are all a lot of fun, and the eight hours I spent in that city seemed to fly by much faster than those spent in Los Santos. When you reach the Badlands, you're again faced with a change in vibe&#226;&#128;&#166;now you're out in the desert: It's very dusty and dirty, there's a lot of off-roading, and eventually a lot of flying, which I found particularly difficult. I think this has to do with the sudden change in gameplay style. After you've been cruising around in off-road vehicles and running around shooting at stuff, the controls of a WWII fighter plane or an attack chopper seem spectacularly sensitive, and you'll find yourself lurching around all over the place and failing miserably to meet any of the flying objectives until you become more subtle with the analog sticks. Here's a tip: switch the camera to a first person view as it makes life much easier."", ""Progress through the desert is extremely focused and driven exclusively by tasks set for you by Mike Toreno, played with typical ferociousness by James Woods. Some of the big gameplay surprises start to emerge out in the desert, and by the 25-hour point, when you leave these dusty environs to meet up with Woozie, who has now moved to Las Venturas, you're really starting to wonder what else the game could possibly dish up. Surely, by this point, anything it's going to do, it's already done, right? Wrong."", ""When you arrive in Las Venturas, the first thing you do is walk into a casino, where you're faced with a variety of different minigames, from roulette to slot machines. If you're prone to video poker addiction, you'll lose a lot of money very quickly at this point in the game, but it's a nice break before the story suddenly turns into Ocean's Eleven."", 'I really love the way the game develops through Las Venturas. Your sense of purpose is focused even further than it was in San Fierro, your relationships with the other major characters are firmly established, and there are some nice little surprises and twists to the story that will keep you both excited, and eager to see it through to the end.', ""And that's where I'm going to end this. There are literally hundreds of things about the game that I've not touched on here, but pretty much all of them are just as rewarding as the things I have discussed. All that remains is to tackle the question we posed at the beginning of this review: Is it really the best game ever made? Quite possibly, yes. Those of you with a sensitive disposition may find aspects of it objectionable, and those of you too hardcore to enjoy anything will no doubt find enough things to complain about to fill a million message board posts. A game of this scope and magnitude cannot help but attract attention, and it probably has more to live up to than any game in history, save for maybe <strong>Half-Life 2</strong>. In a lot of ways, this story would have been more interesting (and certainly more sensational) had I been able to declare that Rockstar had finally bitten off more than it could chew, and aimed too high with this final part of the PS2 trilogy. Thankfully, that's not the case though. It really is a remarkable achievement. </div>""]",Michel Tournier Yasar Avunc,"6,044,822 in Books (",,Books,975539463X

Rascal,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""As the crafty kid hero designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop you must save both your inventor dad and the entire planet from an evil overlord. Take on enemies from cunning pirates to Mayan gods and dragons. Hunt your way through 6 huge worlds -- from the Lost City of Atlantis to the Wild West -- with 18 action-packed levels."", 'Rascal is a visually confusing 3D adventure that is as entertaining as shopping in a crowded grocery store. It is another in a long line of 3D adventure games far below the Mario standard; this game proves dull and inconsistent. <P>Rascal is tasked with wading through six worlds to rescue his father from a bad guy, Chronos. I find it hard to imagine that a boy with a bubble-blowing gun could depose a master of time travel, but such is the premise. As advertised, there are 18 levels to the game (three to a world), but only 12 offer anything more than fighting with said bad guy. In each of those 12 levels you assemble an hourglass of six pieces, which teleports you back home. Each level\'s standard inventory is what you might expect: puzzles, critters, power-ups - not much left to the imagination. And much of the game is centered on merely picking up this stuff. Once Rascal makes it through all six worlds, the game is over. Anyone that has mastered jumping on mushrooms and shooting while running backwards could easily finish this game.  <P>Jim Henson\'s Creature Shop was assigned the task of designing Rascal the character. Sadly, it designed something quite similar to Atari\'s Paperboy. Rascal says little more than ""whoa"" and ""ouch"" as he saunters through many a blandly painted room. The soundtrack in the Old West and Hollywood levels and the random noise in many of the later rooms made me want to die. Luckily, volume is one thing you can control. This game has a few technical problems, too. Seams in between polygons, flickering animation, and pop-up occur regularly. The poor camera angle work makes the game impossible in spots, obscuring what Mario or Lara would see clearly. Objects behind Rascal prevent you from clearly seeing what lies ahead, because the invisible camera can\'t occupy the same space. In some places Rascal disappears for no reason other than camera malfunction. <P>There are a few levels in the Atlantis and Aztec worlds that are well designed, challenging, and cohesive right down to the music. The Paynal character is the rare visual standout of the ordeal, brightly colored and well animated. The high point of the game was several skateboard-styled half-pipes. They were fast, deadly, and fun. What\'s odd is the overall thrown-together feel of the game. The few outstanding levels are so good it makes me wonder if the developers cheaped out due to release date economics. Regardless, Rascal is a 3D adventure similar to Mario 64 or Tomb Raider only in ambition. --Sean Kelly <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Players jaded by performing the same moves with the same characters for years, take note: Capcom managed to put it all together in Street Fighter Alpha 2, creating a fantastic fighting package that mirrors the arcade version. <P>Alpha 2 contains the same eclectic mix of old-school Street Fighter characters, a few Final Fight characters, and a couple of totally new creations - including the old Russian brawler Zangief; the mystical Yoga master Dhalsim; Street Fighter 1 alumnus Gen; grenade-tossing Final Fighter Rolento; and Ryu's biggest fan, Sakura. Toss in the three hidden characters from the first Alpha (Akuma, Dan, and Bison), and you've got a fine selection. <P>The graphics in Alpha 2 are the best the Street Fighter series has ever seen. They approach cartoon-like clarity, right down to facial expressions. The sound is right on, and the music is festooned with arranged versions of classic Street Fighter tunes. <P>The gameplay has been tweaked from Alpha 1. The designers removed the simple-to-do chain combos and replaced them with custom combos, which allow your fighter to go absolutely insane for a short period of time (and dish out heavy-handed pain with lightning fast attacks). Super combos remain the same as the previous Alpha, with three different levels for each attack. <P>Though Alpha 2 may be the same as the rest of the Street Fighters, its high gloss graphics, sound, and gameplay really make this a near-perfect fighting game. 3-D fighters may be the future of the genre, but Alpha 2 proves that 2-D fighting can at times be better than its polygonal brethren. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Deathtrap Dungeon,,['ps1'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Includes game, original case, and manual. Game has moderate scratches but has been tested for playability. Case may have small cracks or flaws.', 'It\'s overwhelmingly sad how clones of Eidos Interactive\'s unmistakably successful 3D adventure title Tomb Raider are getting churned out for the Sony PlayStation. It seems like it\'s the new cookie-cutter genre of choice for gaming companies, just like 2D platform games were for the 16-bit console systems (Spawn, for example, is a repeat offender). However, in the midst of this rampant lack of originality, it\'s quite surprising for a 3D adventure game to arrive that makes you wish it were more like Tomb Raider.  <P>Such is the case with Eidos\' Deathtrap Dungeon, a title whose main differences from TR are the number of enemies you have to fight and its 3D camera - the first of which is very refreshing and the second, absolutely maddening. Backing it all up is a storyline that\'s about as involved as a video game needs to be: Once a year, a powerful wizard offers adventurers a chance to gain riches by surviving his deathtrap-filled dungeon. As either a big-boobed male or female warrior, you rise to the challenge. <P>It\'s a dungeon hack where you carve your way through scads of enemies (such as goblins, killer clowns, half-naked women with swords, four-armed monsters, and, oh say, maybe a Tyrannosaurus Rex), push levers to open up new areas, and try not to tumble into the occasional spike-filled pit. While the diversions are plenty, it\'s the game\'s perspective that keeps the game from being fun. Instead of a continuous behind-the-back view as in Tomb Raider, the camera frenetically moves about high, low, and side to side as you run around. There are even moments when you end up looking at your character\'s face when you\'d rather see what he or she\'s seeing. It\'s possible that the designers were trying to do something original and dynamic, but it would\'ve been much more preferable if they would have just stuck to a third-person perspective. If this was an attempt to showcase the graphics better, then it\'s even more of a failure. They have their nice moments, but there\'s no denying that the appearance of seams and pop-up is pretty frequent. <P>Graphical problems are one thing if they\'re purely aesthetic, but once they trickle into gameplay, that\'s a whole new issue. Whether linked to frustrating cameras or clunky level design, since enemies teleport into the levels, there are times when an enemy appears right around a corner and kills you before you even have a chance to see it, let alone attack. And beyond appearances, you\'ll die a lot, because ""live and learn,"" or rather ""die and learn,"" seems to be the name of the game. There are many traps that have to first be experienced to be avoided later, health potions are scarce on the early levels, enemies will often swarm upon you in groups, and your character is very slow to turn around if set upon from behind. Luckily, the load function is pretty quick, so you\'re not left gnashing your teeth for too long while restarting your saved game. <P>If all of these issues were fixed, Deathtrap Dungeon\'s heavy action element (slicing the goblins into little pieces is great - it\'s the perspective that really gets in the way) would qualify it as more fun than the Tomb Raider series. However, then the puzzles might fall toward the simple side, since the camera\'s trickery is quite possibly what makes the puzzles challenging in the first place. In the end, Deathtrap Dungeon turns out to be at the low end of games for the Sony PlayStation. It\'s not quite as good as Sony\'s Blasto, which it mirrors in that you can see how it could\'ve turned out to be a good game, but it\'s not nearly as bad as Sony\'s Spawn, where you just can\'t imagine what the developers were thinking. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Bust-A-Move 2: Arcade Edition,,['Puzzle Game'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['A lightning quick 100% addictive arcade puzzle game that relies on your sharp eyes and quick reflexes. As multi-colored balls descend you must match 3 or more of them and pop them...fast. Optional two-player action pits you against a friend in a race to bust or be busted. For 1 of 2 players kid to adult.', 'Look up ""addictive"" in a dictionary of gaming terminology, and you\'ll likely find Taito\'s Bust A Move 2 listed with other time-wasting puzzle greats such as Baku Baku, Lemmings, and Tetris. It may be a little late for this classic to be rearing its head on another home system, but slight improvements over the PlayStation version as well as satisfying gameplay still make this one a worthwhile purchase for puzzle-game fans. <P>Bust A Move 2 takes its cue from Tetris, replacing the familiar patterned blocks with colored bubbles and letting you make the shots this time. In the game, the player shoots his or her bubbles up to a cluster of similarly colored bubbles, thereby eliminating that cluster. Three other variables make this general rule more interesting: a) Anything singularly attached to a ""popped"" cluster falls into the abyss, and b) Bubbles can be shot from a wide variety of angles and rebounded off walls. The fact that Bust A Move 2 requires not just strategic thinking, but also sharp aim, is what sets it apart and makes it addictive. <P>In Bust A Move 2\'s single-player mode, the player solves a series of ""puzzle"" levels, which get more complex as the game progresses. The game also offers a multiplayer mode where opponents can send death clusters to the other side if enough bubbles are dropped. <P>The Nintendo controller seems to adapt well to Bust A Move\'s gameplay. Besides being able to use either stick or D-pad for aiming, the programmers who ported the game to the Nintendo added the feature allowing the gun to be nudged slightly left or right with the L and R buttons. This inevitably makes more difficult bank shots a lot less frustrating. <P>Graphics are simple in Bust A Move 2, but they still keep things interesting. The frames of animation exceed those of the PlayStation version, making the game\'s weird winking bubbles and exploding clusters close to arcade quality. In fact, if you can block out the silly storyboard animation sequences and awkward backgrounds, playing Bust A Move 2 for the N64 is pretty close to having the stand-up version at home. <P>Bust A Move 2 is another puzzle game, true, but one that every puzzle fanatic who hasn\'t tried it should try. Acclaim\'s presentation of Taito\'s masterpiece is a nice nostalgic diversion for gamers who remember the stand-up version, and because it\'s easy to learn, it\'s a totally addicting game even for the inexperienced. --Tim Soete <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

You'll freeze rivers, raise or lower ground, and clear fields to give your army a tactical advantage. And you'll also be able to create your own weapons, armor, and phantoms to go with you into turn-based battles--some of which comprise over 20 characters."", ""In <I>Kartia</I>, you'll choose between two characters whose unique, intermingling stories come to different endings. As a bonus, players can trade special items from the game with friends via a standard memory card."", ""Atlus is getting better at this. After finally bringing over the most recent PlayStation installment of its unique Megami Tensei series, Persona, it has become encouraged by the wide-open RPG market and begun porting over its best titles: Ogre Battle, Tactics Ogre, and now Kartia. <P>Originally titled Rebus (in Japan), the newly renamed Kartia refers to the card-based magic the game centers on. Similar in style to Tactics Ogre, Kartia is mainly a strategy game with a unique twist. Instead of concentrating so heavily on the tactical aspects of the game, Kartia focuses on creating phantoms, which are creatures that enter into battle with you. You can also use all sorts of elemental magic based on Kartia as well. During the game you will have the chance to create weapons and new kinds of phantoms. The variety found in Kartia is refreshing and the innovations abound. <P>You begin by choosing one of two characters, Toxe or Lacryma, and follow the story, which is different for each character. Like any decent RPG, the plot is lengthy and involved, and the game time invested in either quest will require significant commitment. Considering you can choose between two different characters adds considerable value. <P>With character designs by Yoshitaka Amano (of Final Fantasy fame) and game design by the producer of the Megami Tensei series, RPG fans will find much to enjoy here. Graphically, the game resembles a simpler Final Fantasy Tactics. However, the game is sharper, clearer, and more colorful than FF Tactics and much easier to navigate with an easy-to-see overhead perspective. Backgrounds are 3D and can be rotated 360 degrees, 90 degrees at a time. Characters are sprite-based and animated well for this sort of game, while spell effects give a good bang for the buck. <P>The sound effects are particularly sharp and add a tangible authenticity to the battle scenes. Gamers who enjoy well-done soundtracks will enjoy the orchestral compositions that lace the Kartia experience. An interesting feature that many gamers will enjoy is the versus mode, where you can take on a friend's army. You can also swap items with other players using your memory cards. <P>Perhaps the only downside (which is not unique to most RPGs, strategy or otherwise) is that the game is quite linear. Aside from that, battles tend to get a bit monotonous; however, the sheer number of options at your disposal goes some way to lightening that burden - small details to be sure and nothing that detracts from the game. Once past the first couple of battles, the subtleties sink in, and it's then that the game becomes a blast. <P>Considering the drought of good RPGs recently, Kartia's presence on the market is perfect timing. The fact that it's a good RPG makes it even better. Kartia's a game with substance and style, one that wins you over without resorting to flashy pyrotechnics or cheap gimmicks. Hopefully gamers won't overlook this game as they salivate in anticipation of games like Final Fantasy VIII. Kartia is a first-rate RPG that we're lucky to have on these shores.

And what gives Unreal an edge is how these differences, while not always positive, distinguish it from the legions of other 3D shooters. <P> In Unreal, you are a prisoner aboard a ship en route to a penal colony. The ship crashes on a mysterious planet where the mystical Nali race is being subjugated by the cruel and technologically advanced Skaarj. As you journey through the many environments on the planet, you must find a means of escape from the planet and help the Nali defeat their oppressors. Unreal intertwines the feel of the medieval Nali architecture and culture with the sci-fi design of the weapons and the Skaarj warriors to create an environment that's a step above other games of its ilk. <P> As far as the game itself, the graphics are incredible. Unreal has the best graphics of any first-person shooter - and possibly of any game - to date. The palette is bright and varied, while the textures are intricate and well defined. The quality of textures deserves high praise - they help create environments that really take hold of you. The levels are so detailed and distinct that it's easy to distinguish one level from all the others, and you won't confuse the prison spacecraft for the Nali village. In conjunction with the graphics, the level design is advanced and complex. The mix of wide-open spaces and cramped hallways is refreshing. As far as graphics go, you just can't beat Unreal's immersion factor. <P> Combining an alien world with weapons that seem alien themselves has produced some interesting results. As varied as the ten weapons are, there's also an alternate method of firing each of them (the 8-Ball Launcher, Unreal's equivalent of a rocket launcher, can also be used as a grenade launcher). This wide range of attack styles will undoubtedly produce higher degrees of strategy in deathmatch play. As for single-player, the weapon placement and location was spaced out evenly, and finding ammunition was not a daunting task. <P> One of Unreal's best features is the enemy AI. In other games, the logic of certain creature actions seems to be linear and undefined. In Unreal, each opponent attacks with its own style, using a combination of melee and ranged attacks. One of the most impressive experiences (if not the most aggravating) was seeing a well-placed rocket shot miss because a Skaarj dodged it at the last second. Another eye-catching sight was watching different enemies power up shields to protect themselves in the midst of battle. <P> As far as problems go, there are some, but they don't hurt gameplay enough to reduce the overall experience. The first is that there are too few enemy model types. Unreal has only six main enemy models, but the design team has done a pretty good job of using different skins to create a variety of opponents. In addition, there are other models for the random critters that you fight throughout your adventuring. <P> Another complaint deals with the pace of gameplay. Sometimes the pace of action seems too stretched out, and it feels as if each battle is just the same as the last. However, these gaps were few, and for the most part the game pacing and plot development were enjoyable. On the puzzle-solving side, there isn't much to be had; most of the game you simply push buttons to open a path leading to the next level. But your actions involving them are well integrated into the plot. There are few complex puzzles to solve; it's doubtful that Unreal would benefit from more in that area. <P> Lastly, the weapons are pretty cool, but there's no simplicity in design. Each gun takes some practice to understand its use and benefits, but in the end, you spend too much time learning. Rather than give you instinctual weapons (like a basic shotgun or machine gun), Unreal's unusual weaponry forces you to adjust the way you play, without much added benefit of weapon ferocity or visceral gratification. <P> If you're looking to hone your deathmatch skills, however, you're going to find playing online to be next to impossible. The developers have stated in the readme.txt file that the game is still in the tweaking phase as far as Internet play is concerned. But with seemingly boundless game customizability options as well as in-package deathmatch levels, Unreal gives you everything you need to practice for the big time. It even gives you a choice of bots designed by Steve Polge to test your mettle. This was probably one of the most enjoyable features, and after you've finished the game you can go in and set up your own games for a single-player deathmatch experience. <P> Unreal is a truly great single-player game. It's hard to say whether it will stand the test of the first-person action-shooter wars and become a classic in and of itself. It will definitely have to overcome the lack of a decent Internet experience if it wants to obtain any more accolades, but, apart from that, it offers as much as you could possibly want from a game in this genre. <i>--Tahsin Shamma</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Wargames: Defcon 1,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['When I first heard that MGM Interactive had a WarGames-related game in the works, I was totally excited. I wanted to take control of Matthew Broderick and hack into NORAD on a TRS-80. I wanted to ride around on the back of Ally Sheedy\'s moped as she carted me from school to home. I wanted to push a button that made the guy in the missile silo pull out a pistol and shout ""Turn your key, sir!"" Alas, this game has none of that. It is, however, an outstanding mission-based shooter. Think EA\'s Strike series, but with lots of different units. <P>Each of the game\'s 30 missions (15 as NORAD, 15 as WOPR) gives you a collection of units ranging from lightly armored jeeps to monstrous tanks, helicopters, and jets, and points you at stuff that you need to blow up. You control each unit one at a time, with the ability to switch between them at will. You do have the ability to call units to your location, giving the other units AI control, but the AI is so terrible that your units will have a hard time crossing a bridge, let alone fighting the enemy. Playing the game is quite simple. You just take a tank and start towards your next objective. Shoot anything that gets in your way, taking care to back up to dodge enemy fire. This, coupled with the fact that most of your units can take loads of damage, and that it\'s extremely easy to replenish your units, makes WarGames pretty darn easy. Two-player mode puts the game in a diagonal split-screen and has both head-to-head and cooperative modes. <P>Graphically, WarGames looks really good. All the structures and units (with the possible exception of the miniscule infantry) look very nice, and the terrain is well drawn. The terrain is also damaged during firefights, resulting in forest fires and other environmental chaos. The soundtrack is very military and drives the point of the game home. The effects are very nice, and the text scroll noise is directly from the old movie. The voice of Joshua also makes a small appearance at the title screen. <P>While WarGames: Defcon 1 may not have allowed me to relive one of my favorite films, it is still a solid game with a fairly good back story. Dabney Coleman may be nowhere to be found here, but once you get past this slight oversight (all games should feature at least one picture of Dabney), you\'ll discover a great shooter. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Packaging may differ slightly from the stock photo above.', 'New World Computing\'s classic Might and Magic games helped to define the subgenre that grizzled old RPG grognards now affectionately refer to as ""traditional style"" role-playing games. All of the previous Might and Magic role-playing games were set in expansive gaming worlds, filled with exotic locations, tomes of spells, armies of enemy types, and hoards of magic items. But during the past couple of years, such traditional role-playing games have been rarer than orcs in Denver. <P> The game takes place in the world of Enroth, a setting that will be familiar to veterans of the Heroes of Might and Magic spin-off strategy games. Good King Roland was apparently victorious in his battles with evil old Archibald, only to have his united lands fall prey to the ravages of an invasion of devils. When the King disappears after encountering the devilish horde, the ineffectual child prince Nicolai assumes control of the Kingdom. Your humble party of four adventurers has the onerous task of gaining the gratitude of the Kingdom\'s regional leaders, parlaying with a cryptic, omniscient Oracle in order to unravel the mystery behind Roland\'s disappearance and, along the way, carving a destructive path through a hellish legion of enemies. Welcome to the medieval jungle. <P> As with previous games in the series, Might and Magic VI is a first-person-perspective party-based game. In a minor break from Might and Magic tradition, all of your characters are human (elves need not apply), and there are only six available character classes.<P> Far more interesting is the game\'s character development system. Stomping monsters and completing quests will net your characters experience points. Gain enough experience points, and you\'ll be able to raise the levels of your characters, provided that you hook up with a capable trainer and have a few spare coins. With each increase in level, a character will gain a handful of points that can be used to increase that character\'s skills. Gain enough expertise in a particular skill, and you can train to become an expert and then a master in that skill, acquiring additional abilities in the process.<P> The graphics in Might and Magic VI are the best yet seen in a 3D first-person-perspective role-playing game. At one point in the game\'s development, hardware support for 3D graphics cards was contemplated, which certainly would have been welcome. But even without 3D acceleration, the graphics are generally crisp and clear, with a minimum of pixelation. Like prior games in the series, the graphics are also very colorful, which takes a while to get used to for those of us accustomed to somewhat more realistic, but considerably more dreary, depictions of our fantasy gaming worlds. <P> One of the best things about Might and Magic VI is that Enroth was clearly crafted with a lot of care and attention to detail. Although the game is huge, taking well over 100 hours to complete, each of the towns and dungeons was individually designed. There are tons of other little details that make Might and Magic VI special. You can fly like a Spitfire through the air and fire arrows at packs of monsters - miss them as they run by a stream, and your arrows will splash into the water. Go into a few too many shops without purchasing or selling anything, and you\'ll start to be rebuked by their keepers: ""See ya, tightwad!"" Walk into the right thieves\' guild, and you\'ll be confronted with a Monty Python-esque ""nudge, nudge, know what I mean, know what I mean...."" knowing glance from the trainer. A big metallic-looking guy loaded with vicious-looking swords who looks like a walking Ginsu knife is appropriately labeled a Cuisinart. There are some excellent sound effects as well - shoot a harpy out of the sky, and you\'ll be treated to the sound of it falling like a crumpled bird. Gargoyles shatter into pebbles. The sound of your footsteps reflects the nature of the ground you\'re walking on, whether it\'s hardened rock, fresh snow, or a damp beach. Music isn\'t used a great deal in the game, but it works well when it appears. <P> There are a few other minor disappointments. The interface is non-customizable, so you\'re stuck using the default key settings even if you find them inconvenient. Although it is basically a keyboard-controlled game, you still have to occasionally use the mouse, which is a bit cumbersome. The different geographical regions in the game don\'t quite integrate fully, meaning you\'ll occasionally be unable to loot the bodies of enemies that wandered outside of your current region. The main window for depicting the 3D gaming world is quite small, and even though there are hotkeys for all of the functions you need, there is surprisingly no ""full screen"" mode. The cutscene introduction is well done, but it feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the game, and the introductory dialogue seems like it was scripted after the cutscene was already completed. Your interaction with the nonplayer characters wandering around town is quite limited, although you can get such NPCs to tag along to grant your party additional abilities, but such NPCs won\'t otherwise directly participate in the game. You might also be disappointed with the digitized character portraits, which sometimes don\'t seem to fit in with the other animated graphics. The voice acting of your characters is also of mixed quality, although I generally enjoyed it. Each of the characters has his own distinct expressions (""Chalk up another for the big guy!""), which is another nice touch. <P> There are also a few bugs and graphical quirks. There are occasional clipping errors, which allow you to see, or even interact with, objects through walls. Certain spells, like Meteor Shower will occasionally not complete their animations if they are cast on an enemy who is on sloped terrain, causing the game to hang. Switch the game from real-time mode to turn-based while your characters are on inclined terrain, and you\'ll gradually trickle down the incline (as will monsters similarly placed). Some spells don\'t seem to work as intended - I was never able to even momentarily ""Stun"" the most ineffectual of enemies.<P> But such quirks and bugs are really quite trivial. Overall, Might and Magic VI is a remarkably stable game - one of the most bug-free role-playing games in years. Even more importantly, it\'s tremendously addictive. There always seems to be one more quest you just have to complete, one more skill you have to elevate to mastery, one more region to explore... one more night to forget to sleep before dragging yourself to work. It\'s been a long time since a Might and Magic role-playing game was released, and many gamers questioned whether or not New World Computing could recapture the magic of past games in the series. We shouldn\'t have worried. Might and Magic VI is a classically designed role-playing game that features both a huge gaming world and lots of attention to detail. It\'s a standout game in what should be a great year for role-playing game fans. Might and Magic is back, and it\'s better than ever. <i>--Desslock</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Flight Simulator 98 (w/ World of Flight Bonus Disc),,['Microsoft Flight Simulator 98'],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>', 'Microsoft Flight Simulator 98']",{},"[""Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 lets armchair pilots take the controls of authentic aircraft including the Boeing 737, the Extra 300S, the Cessna Skylane 182S, the Learjet 45, the Bell 206B JetRanger III helicopter, and the Schweitzer 2-32. Players can fly over the 3D cities of Hong Kong, San Francisco, London, Tokyo, New York, Paris, Chicago, and Seattle. Photo imaging of Martha's Vineyard, Chelan, Las Vegas, and realistic weather effects enhance the flying experience. Over 3,000 airports with famous landmarks are included. Players can learn the basics of flying through the in-flight tutorial, while the Flight School continue pilot's education through the advanced and complex details."", 'Competition is good. Microsoft Flight Simulator has long been the undisputed champion of the civil aviation sim scene, and the last four years\' worth of halfhearted upgrades led some to think that the flyboys in Redmond had given up even trying. Now, with two highly anticipated contenders on the way - Sierra\'s Pro Pilot and Looking Glass\'s Flight Unlimited 2 - Microsoft has proven itself fighting fit with a thorough retooling of the classic. <P> While flight scenery under standard hardware has been tuned, with a graphics accelerator card - the game supports Direct3D compatible cards - the graphics have become breathtaking, and it\'s no surprise that the illusion of flight is all the more convincing. Gone are the shimmer of distant scenery and the flicker of ground lights at night. Clouds are wispy and transparent, and the aliased patchwork terrain of earlier versions is now smoothly blended and vastly more realistic. Devotees will also notice more subtle graphic embellishments: Runways have skid-marks, and dawn really does now rise in the East. With the release of Windows 98, this version of Microsoft Flight Simulator will even support multiple monitors, making homemade wraparound cockpits a real (and, for spouses, terrifying) possibility. <P> Not only does the view out the window look better, there\'s more to see. Thirty North American cities are now rendered in detail, along with 15 others in Europe and Asia. Perhaps the most stunning is Hong Kong, which is faithfully represented right down to the checkerboard approach (which requires of pilots a last-minute sharp turn before landing). The Las Vegas, Hawaii, Japan, and Caribbean scenery expansion packs have been subsumed in this release, and the detail of the New York and Paris graphics exceed those of the retail enhancement add-ons. Microsoft has also made available a conversion utility for shareware scenery from earlier versions. <P> More than 3,000 airports are available for takeoffs and landings, but planning the flights in between is impossible without resorting to third-party tools; the ""database"" of navigational aids is merely a text listing of transmitters and beacons, and detailed area maps are provided only for the 45 major metropolitan airports. While this is an improvement upon the previous version - which offered no maps - it\'s still a notable shortcoming. <P> The stable of available aircraft has evolved to include fixed- and retractable-gear versions of the single-engined Cessna 182, the new Learjet 45, plus enhanced versions of the 737-400, Sopwith Camel, Schweitzer sailplane, and Extra 300S for aerobatics. For the first time, a helicopter is included: the Bell 206, which fixed-wing pilots will find an unfamiliar (and initially frustrating) flight experience. Instrument panels and controls are rendered in greater detail, right down to the realistic throttle knob on the Cessna, and the fully user-configurable keyboard layouts and joystick button assignments are a welcome addition. <P> The flight models of the aircraft are as realistic as ever, and Microsoft\'s association with FlightSafety International - a major training organization - will presumably speed acceptance of MSFS as a flight instruction tool. Included in the manual is even a coupon for a cut-rate first flying lesson from Cessna. <P> Other technical innovations include support for Force Feedback joysticks, bringing a new sensation to the PC flight sim. The experience is disconcertingly realistic - runways really are bumpy - and the rattle of the stick in a stall will send a shiver down your spine. Multiplayer support also returns, via LAN or the Internet (hosted free to players at Microsoft\'s Internet Gaming Zone). <P> Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 is an impressive feat. With a few exceptions, gone are the glaring flaws of the previous version; coupled with its technological innovations, the sum of the parts is a unique flight experience of unprecedented realism. Although the flight sim skies will soon be crowded, Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 will prove an able contender with the best of what the competition offers. <i>--Pete Deemer</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Nightmare Creatures,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['small damage on upper right corner of label', 'Kalisto Entertainment\'s Nightmare Creatures originally came out for the PlayStation around Halloween of \'97. The game received high marks for atmosphere and design, but its overall score was brought down by control issues, a weak combo system, and occasional perspective problems. Now, a year later, Nightmare Creatures has come to the Nintendo 64, and while it\'s an almost identical game, the developers have gladly used that time to correct some of the title\'s flaws. <P>Nightmare Creatures sees 19th century London threatened by an onrush of gruesome beasts brought forth by the evil Adam Crowley (sort of a mix of the 1920s ""wickedest man in the world"" Aleister Crowley and The Muppet Show\'s Animal) and his sinister cult, the Brotherhood of Hecate. It\'s your job to wipe out these most unholiest of unholies and their master - either as the young American swordswoman Nadia or Ignatius, the ass-kicking monk.  <P>While Nightmare Creatures has been likened to a hybrid of Eidos\' Tomb Raider and Capcom\'s Resident Evil, that\'s not an entirely accurate analogy. The title takes place in a spooky 3D world that you view from a behind-the-back perspective; and that\'s where any comparison to either of the games pretty much stops. The game runs at a jaunty 30+ frames per second with up to four monsters simultaneously onscreen and with little or no slowdown. The graphics appear much crisper in the Nintendo 64 version, and the fog effects seen in the original look even more impressive here (the N64 can do fog in its sleep, which we\'ve all learned almost ad nauseam). <P>But catacombs and cesspools aside, the real mood setters are the monsters. You\'ll encounter 15 distinct types of creatures (ranging from zombies to giant spiders, dog-sized rats to werewolves, hellhounds to harpies, and three-headed ogres to flaming imps) and five different bosses, such as the Yeti, a four-headed fire-breathing serpent, and old Crowley himself. All the beasts have distinct powers and attack styles, making them quite a caliginous handful when an unpredictable, varied group pounces on your character all at once. <P>To combat these nasties, the characters are each equipped with a rudimentary sword or staff, which can eventually be upgraded to more lethal devices such as spiked clubs, double axes, and machetes. Beyond the basic wherewithal to attack these monsters in the first place, you also have a variety of fighting moves at your disposal. Additionally, there are quite a few power-ups to be found, such as single-shot and burst pistols, half and full healths, mines, fire bombs, and freeze and confusion spells. Besides the proficiency of the enemy creatures, there\'s an ever-dwindling adrenaline bar, which measures the amount of the natural stimulant in your system that must remain full to keep a Crowley-concocted poison from killing you. You can keep your adrenaline high only by continuously seeking out and winning battles. <P>And fighting the creatures can be a lot of fun, at least early on. They\'re very well designed, and their animations give them an eerie sense of life - and power-ups such as the razor (which lets you slice them in half or quarters) are quite a kick. In fact, you can lop off the monsters\' heads, and their bodies will often still chase after you. The problem here is that the fighting system is still fairly basic. While there are many moves for your character to use, they\'re very difficult to pull off, and many of them leave you open to attack afterwards. This causes you to quickly adopt a strategy of navigating creatures into corners and mashing on the buttons (triple pushes on A or B and going back and forth between them are actually some of the basic combos). The game is still fun, but having to use the same moves throughout gets a little old, though admittedly the different power-ups and new kinds of monsters keep it from getting totally dull. <P>One of the game\'s noticeable improvements however is the control. To begin with, the N64 controller handles the setup much more elegantly than the old-edition PlayStation pad, and the analog control is a dream. But the real design improvement is that during combat, the character is aimed at the monster he\'s battling. If he sidesteps, he\'s still focused on the creature. This can be a little problematic when you\'re trying to avoid a fight, though it\'s helpful enough during a fight to not be an issue. Not having camera control is still very frustrating during the boss stages (during the Yeti encounter, for instance, you have to line up just right to pick up items that are offscreen), but it doesn\'t really come up otherwise.  <P>Another nice touch to the game is that the designers tweaked the sewer stage to be much easier to navigate. In the original, you had to complete a number of difficult running jumps while avoiding/fighting several large, poly-tentacled monsters and not falling into the deadly water. The area now has a series of connected catwalks to run through - albeit with a few jumps - so the level is consequently much more enjoyable. Additionally, the having-to-keep-on-fighting-to-keep-your-adrenaline-going aspect seems to be less of a problem. Perhaps the creators have added or moved the enemies around so that you can recharge easier and thus explore the environment better. <P>It\'s really great to see a port of a game not make all the mistakes the original did, and it makes the title much easier to recommend. Nightmare Creatures still isn\'t a perfect game, but it now has enough going for it to be worth the time it takes to explore its dark, spooky world. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

If you do find it necessary to check the instruction booklet, you\'ll find it well thought out and efficiently designed. In fact, the game instructions only take up a few pages, while the rest of the booklet focuses on the individual characteristics of the different holes of Waialae, which ultimately winds up being the game\'s main shortcoming: There\'s only one course, the eponymous Waialae course in Honolulu. <P>Despite this, T&E Soft have managed to create an engaging number of options to compensate for the lack of course variety. Six different modes are available for your perusal: Waialae Open, tournament play, stroke play, match play, skins play, and practice play round out the selections offered. As most of these modes are self-explanatory, most armchair golfers will likely gravitate towards the Waialae Open. During competition, you\'ll find the game screen considerately designed, and there\'s an innovative menu selection for tailoring your approach to the green. Tee up, club selection, stance, hit point, and shot are the basic options available onscreen. Tee up lets you place the tee, club selection lets you choose your club, while stance lets you adjust your own positioning. Hit point lets you select the spot where you hit the ball, since hitting it lower on its surface will cause a higher arc with less distance, while hitting the ball on the upper part of the sphere will result in a line drive. Shot, as the name implies, finally allows you to drive the ball, while making even further adjustments. Not to say that this is a tedious affair, quite the opposite. Generally, if you choose to avoid the majority of the menus, you can simply go straight to shot and not suffer any detrimental consequences since the computer caddie selects the appropriate club for you anyway. While lining up your shot, a rainbow-colored arc indicates the likely trajectory of your ball, allowing you to make further refinements in your shot selection. While this may sound complex to some, it\'s really not, and might possibly be the one of the easiest golf games to just plug and play. <P>All of this golfing joy doesn\'t come without its downside, however. Through no fault of the N64\'s processing power, WCC has its fair share of shortcomings, the most obvious being the single course to play. Other not so wonderful factors include an almost aggravating sameness to each of the holes. Maybe once during the 18 holes will you get a change in the weather - usually a pathetic-looking attempt at rain that looks like a kid with a white crayon drawing all over the screen. The consistent sunniness (odd shower aside) of the game coupled with a rather bland game engine combine to make a fairly monotonous golf experience. All the holes look the same. Each progressive hole you start looks just like the last one, which tends to sap your incentive to play. Despite Nintendo\'s assurances that this game is fully polygonal, the characters are made up of digitized sprites, resulting in a pasted-on-the-screen look that some might find annoying. Unimpressive frame rates also conspire to hamper the proceedings, nothing horrible, mind you, but you would think the N64 had more to give than this poorly designed engine displays. Perhaps the least important but equally disappointing factor is the color commentary. You get two guys blabbing on, who sound like they\'re reading a children\'s book, to children. To call these guys dry isn\'t enough. You feel like you\'re listening to some kind of ""learn a foreign language"" tape. Try to avoid paying attention to these guys. It makes the whole thing easier that way. <P>Working in the game\'s favor are some neat little options such as the create-a-player feature, which lets you alter your player\'s attributes and even his clubs! Another handy feature is the Cartcam, which lets you explore the course in a virtual cart. While it does little to help you anticipate the nuances of the course - and actually highlights the games graphical weaknesses like flat cardboard trees and people - it\'s still an entertaining diversion. Think Duke Nukem 64 in a golf cart, and you\'re halfway there. <P>Despite the zits and pimples, Waialae Country Club is a competently designed golf game. Its only major downfalls are the lack of variety and the disappointing game engine. However, WCC\'s bad points are better than most other console golf games\' good points, so it\'s a fair trade-off. Throw in a golf bag full of picture-perfect gameplay, and you\'ve got an excellent alternative to doing the real thing. If you like golf and are dying to have a golf game for your N64, this game is recommended. Otherwise, like a trip to Honolulu, Waialae Country Club True Golf Classics is best appreciated as a short-term investment. Rental only. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Akuji: The Heartless,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['""My weapons are an extension of my will,"" boasts Akuji, a voodoo warrior priest with a serious score to settle. As the story opens, you--Akuji--find that your brother has killed you and imprisoned your fianc&eacute;e. Not only that, but you, as the undead Akuji, must seek revenge and save the woman you love. There is just one problem: the keeper of the gates of the underworld will not let you leave until you purge all the levels of hell of the souls of your evil ancestors!', ""Rendered in stunning 3-D, this very playable third-person game immerses you in the world of voodoo mythology. Built around an engaging story, <i>Akuji</i> is a bitter struggle against the evils of your heritage. Wrist blades and devastating spells are your only allies in this horrific battle. While the basic key hunt structure of most first- and third-person shooters is also present here, the grimly fascinating story line keeps the player involved. That said, the nightmarish reality of Akuji's voodoo struggle is not for the squeamish. <i>--Allen Stewart</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Beautiful, fluid graphics</li> <li>Compelling story</li> <li>Spooky sound effects and scenery</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Very creepy plot</li> <li>Little variation of enemies</li> <li>Too dependent on monotonous key hunts</li> </ul>', 'With a modified Gex: Enter the Gecko engine at its core and a loose interpretation of voodoo as its backbone, Crystal Dynamics\' Akuji the Heartless is a grim and gritty ""full scroller"" that dares to defy Spyro the Dragon and the rest of the recent slew of light-hearted 3D platform games for the PlayStation. The story is equal parts Todd McFarlane\'s Spawn and Dante\'s Inferno: You\'re a voodoo-practicing, blade-wielding hero, and you\'ve been slaughtered and had your heart ripped out on your wedding day by your brother. Now you travel through the planes of hell, destroying its caretakers and collecting the souls of your ancestors for the top-hat-wearing voodoo loa, Baron Samedi. If you do, he\'s promised to grant you passage out of the underworld to take revenge on your sibling rival and reunite with your sweetheart.  <P>Visually, Akuji\'s 3D world appears much like a darker-themed version of Gex: Enter the Gecko and carries many impressive little graphical and lighting effects throughout (the chamber of rolling snakeskins comes to mind). Undercutting these niceties, though, is the game\'s camera, which can be moved from side to side around the character using the L1 and R1 buttons, targeted with R2, or else it otherwise eventually shifts into position. The problem is that ""eventually"" takes too long to rely on, causing you to continually shift the camera around, hence turning the perspective into another of the game\'s many puzzles. (I don\'t know about you, but I have simple enough needs when it comes to 3D platform-game cameras: I just want them to stick in a view that\'s aimed in the direction my character is facing.) <P>The music in Akuji is exceptional. It has an excellent undulating soundtrack that obviously loops but also changes its rhythm from time to time and keeps its jungle beat sounding continually fresh. The pace of the music also picks up whenever a fight begins, which works to build tension unless you\'re confronting the most pathetic grunt creature. Both elements work together to set a great mood for the game. The voice work, on the other hand, is only decent. Akuji\'s voice-overs (done by Shaft\'s Richard Roundtree) are occasionally delivered in a tone of near disbelief (when he picks up the Hell Blast spell, he says ""Hell-Blast"" as if asking a voice coach, ""Is this right?"") and are never as dynamic as you\'d expect them to be. Slightly worth noting is the fact that Akuji\'s bride-to-be sounds far too old for him, leading to the thought of her being his mother instead. (If you make that leap, the beginning of the game is very funny. When she starts explaining the basics, you think, ""Aw mom! Leave me alone! I\'m trying to play a game!"")  <P>Besides the game camera though, the rest of this is ancillary to the title\'s gameplay, which is decent and sometimes very fun. It\'s a nice, easy little platform game that\'ll only take you about eight to ten hours to beat in all, making it a good, brief distraction from tougher, time-devouring titles such as Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It\'s over a little too quickly to recommend Akuji for purchase, but it\'s well worth the money and time it\'d take to rent it. -- Steven Garrett <P><I>--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

The concept of futuristic multi-terrain racing on motorbikes is quite cool, and the shots on the back of the box do look awesome. Once the controller is in hand and play has begun, however, a very, very steep learning curve awaits.', ""The graphics in Jet Moto are OK. They're not Wave Race, but this isn't the Nintendo 64. Jet Moto's waves look slightly two-dimensional, and the entire environment has a pixelated choppiness to it. Ultimately, the graphics on each level are pulled off with varying degrees of success (the snow looks much more realistic than the water)."", 'An assortment of challenges is presented - players race through sandy beaches, swamps, snowy mountains, and futuristic cityscapes. Each course makes for good racing, thanks to a full complement of cool jumps and sharp turns. The courses vary enough that players need to acquire a different strategy for each. Jet Moto features multiple modes of play, including custom circuits, single races, a two-player split-screen mode, a full season mode (which must be completed to unlock the tracks), and an elusive ""stunt mode.""', 'The play control in Jet Moto is quite standard. There are the typical left/right, speed up/slow down controls, along with requisite ""turbo"" boosts. A neat feature is the magnetic ""grapple"" that allows for tight, high-speed turns on corners with magnetic ""grapple posts."" This feature is utilized quite cleverly on some levels, and is the basis of others (in which players run the course in both directions and must make incredibly tight turns). Aside from the grapple, the controls leave something to be desired. It\'s a struggle to turn fast and accurately, and crashing is frequent (resulting in not-so-fantastic crash replays).', 'Keeping all of the above in mind, Jet Moto is incredibly difficult. Given the marginal play control and general difficulty of the game, things can get pretty frustrating very quickly. To get past each batch of three courses players must finish first on all three (not an average, but first in each race). While this sounds easy, it\'s not. The 20 selectable riders are divided into corporate-sponsored teams, and each possesses his own strengths. That is to say, there is no ""dream team"" that lets players breeze through the game. No matter which rider is selected, players are in for a challenge - mastering each course can take hours. The difficulty level can be notched down, but this limits progress through the game. If it weren\'t for the GameShark, I doubt I would have been able to access the later levels (which include the awesome snow courses).', ""Jet Moto has some really cool features, but the game takes far too long to master. Avid gameplayers who are really into racing games will get their money's worth out of this title. However, those seeking casual thrills are better off skipping this title in favor of a game that's easier to learn. -- Glenn Rubenstein"", '<i>--Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

NCAA Final Four '99,,['PS1'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['In the class of college basketball games, NCAA Final Four 99 gets a passing grade because it delivers what its peers have failed to: fast-paced gameplay. But don\'t get too excited: 989 Sports\' first foray into college hoops also has suspect AI that\'ll irritate die-hard gamers. <P>Although this title borrows gameplay elements (mainly icon passing and cutting) from its cousin, NBA ShootOut 99, it establishes its own presentation style quite well. Graphically, there isn\'t much to complain about. In addition to detailed stadiums and floors, the game adds nice touches, such as referees and coaches on the sidelines. Perhaps the biggest graphical flaw is the occasional speedup or slowdown in animation when a shot\'s being taken. The commentary by Quinn Buckner may get stale after a while, but it\'s better than nothing. <P>The AI in this game still needs a lot of work. It\'s not really an issue in multiplayer games (where both sides are handicapped equally), but when playing against the computer, be prepared for ""Believe It or Not"" style gameplay. First off, virtually every shot is a fadeaway (outside the paint) or hook (in the paint). Second, players magically slide backwards on defense - sometimes, seemingly teleporting - as they defendagainst a fast break. <P>This game\'s AI difficulty level ranges from incredibly easy to incredibly cheesy. There are some cheap ways to beat the computer, even at the highest difficulty level. For instance, repeated jumping on defense almost always guarantees a steal when a wing tries to dump the ball into the post. At the easiest level, you can win on turbo-button fast breaks and no-brainer threes. At the toughest level, be prepared for your AI opponent - even a horrid team - to make every shot, despite being double- or triple-teamed. This is hardly realistic, and provides virtually no incentive to play solid defense, so games at this difficulty degenerate into who can pull off the most cheesy steals and score the most. <P>989 Sports does fill this game with original new features that raise its value. The most notable (and worthy of praise) is the optional shot meter. With it on, you can see the point where you should release the shooting button to make an accurate shot. This instant feedback adds excitement to the game by making every shot an exercise in reflexes. Plus, if you\'re a new player, it gives you a feel for the timing needed for outside shots and fadeaways. <P>Undoubtedly, you probably want to know how this game stacks up against NCAA March Madness 99. Despite the previously mentioned AI flaws, this title has a distinct edge. First and foremost, this game has more than twice as many teams. These extra teams, mainly from smaller conferences, make it much easier to simulate this year\'s NCAA tournament, as well as serve to appease you if you\'re from  one of the schools slighted by March Madness 99. Second, while the titles are dead even in the graphics department, 989 Sports\' game can play much faster, thanks to an adjustable game speed option. <P>Final Four 99 does lack the extras found in its main competitor - mainly, no women\'s play and no season-end conference tourneys in season mode. It also lacks the exact equivalent of a momentum meter, which gives teams confidence as they make scoring runs. Final Four 99 does have a command to rile up crowds (for home teams) and taunt, but this seems more ornamental than useful.  <P>Final Four 99 has numerous fixes to make before it call itself a great game. Still, for all its flaws, it\'s the most fun-to-play college basketball game on the market so far, if only for its faster speed. It\'s a game that most casual fans would probably be willing to settle for. --Nelson Taruc <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Penny Racers - Nintendo 64,,['Nintendo'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Based on the toy line of miniaturized cars, <i>Penny Racers</i> is cutesy kart racing with a twist. Rather than selecting a car with predetermined characteristics as in most games of this genre, you customize a generic Racer with almost 100 parts in eight different categories. Starting off with the worst possible parts, you must win races to get better parts, which you ""relieve"" the losers of; this can lead to some serious cutthroat action when it comes to multiplayer games. High replay value is further upped by the game\'s ""New Track"" option, which allows you to create your very own tracks.', 'The downside to all these custom options is the fact that a <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001WRIM/${0}"">Memory Pack</a> is more of a necessity than a ""supported"" accessory. Without one, you can\'t save any Racer or track data, and it would be a real shame to lose that Japanese noodle shop truck with the off-road tires and roof-mounted cannon when you turn off your Nintendo. <i>--Joe Hon</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Wide variety of customization options for your Racer</li> <li>Ability to create your own tracks</li> <li>High replay value and excellent multiplayer action</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Memory Pack more of a requirement than an option</li> <li>3- and 4-player modes available only on custom-made tracks</li> <li>Cartoony theme may turn off veteran gamers</li> </ul>', 'Import-savvy fans will recognize Penny Racers as the domesticated version of Takara\'s Choro-Q 64. Basically the N64 addition to the Choro-Q series, which originally made famous on the PlayStation, revolves around a slew of wacky superdeformed cars and trucks that, naturally enough, are all trying to get to the finish line first. Duh! Penny Racers attempts to improve on this ""concept"" by adding four-player racing to the mix. Does it match up, or surpass, the previous installments of its 32-bit counterpart? Hardly. <P>Sure, the cars and tracks found on the PlayStation were cartoony enough, but the graphical complexity found in Penny Racers sinks to a new low. Simpler than even Mario 64 or Pilotwings, Penny Racers makes Mario Kart 64 look like Sonic Adventure. Bland, color-by-number track design offers little in the way of detail, and the complete lack of light sourcing and the generally slow pace of the game give Penny Racers an anemic visual impression at best. Perhaps the most aggravating thing is that the cars (which are simple, low-poly-count designs) still have the blocky, non-anti-aliased look of the PlayStation version. Surely with all the power of the N64, the cars could have been made to look a touch better? <P>Graphic faux pas aside, the gameplay has also taken a turn for the worse. Driving in Penny Racers feels like you\'re always riding on a dusty highway, and while that may be fine for some of you cowboys out there, the utter lack of grippage in this game wears extremely thin on the patience. Sure you can do barrel rolls(?), but this technique adds little to the game. Presumably this tactic was added to give you an option, while trying to avoid the Wipeout-esque weaponry available to all of the racers. Whoa, is that a land mine? Hey, barrel-roll out of the way! <P>Once you adjust to the slide-a-thon, you might actually wind up in first place, at which point you\'ll be able to start upgrading your car, which is really the only saving point of this game. The Choro-Q series has always been about customization, and it\'s no different here. Tons of different options await the best drivers: dozens of car types and styles, multitudes of accessories and colors, etc. Having the patience to access all of these prizes is another matter. <P>Musically, most people will want to turn down the chirpy, 16-bit-sounding music before it raises their blood pressure too high. A tweaky, bleepy, honking apparition of a soundtrack ""graces"" Penny Racers, which makes one glad for the volume control in the game. The best advice is to turn it all the way down. <P>If you have four people in your household impervious to the many visual and musical assaults found in the game, there is a four-player mode. Due to the graphic simplicity of the game, there is little loss of detail in four-player mode, and the frame rate stays moderately high. Now four people can trudge their way through the game at once! <P>Basically this game is for parents who don\'t know any better and who want to get their kids something that will keep them out of their hair. Mario Kart 64 or Diddy Kong Racing are still better bets, since the Choro-Q 64 engine is showing its age and showing it badly. -- James Mielke <P><I>--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Colony Wars Vengeance,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""In Colony Wars: Vengeance, the sequel to Psygnosis' award-winning space shooter, Colony Wars, you assume the role of Mertens, an idealistic Navy pilot out to wreak revenge against the merciless League that defeated his people one hundred years earlier, imprisoning them in their home system and dooming them to a century of civil war. Lead by the messianic Kron, Mertens and the rest of the Navy plunge headlong into the heart of League territory, hoping to restore the Navy to its prior greatness... or die trying. But is the charismatic Navy leader all that he seems?"", 'In response to player feedback, Psygnosis packed a number of improvements into Colony Wars: Vengeance. While the number of selectable ships has dropped from seven to five, a brand-new upgrade system now enables you to customize each craft to your liking. Devastating ""sentinel"" superweapons in addition to new air-to-ground combat infuse the game with some sorely needed variety. The game\'s collision detection and physics also have been improved thanks to a powerful new game engine. The one thing that hasn\'t changed, however, is the game\'s nearly impossible level of difficulty; Colony Wars: Vengeance is guaranteed to provide a formidable challenge for even the most battle-tested PlayStation pilots.', 'As in the original, failing a mission does not lead to instantaneous death, as it does in most games of Colony Wars\' ilk; rather, a branching mission tree spins the story in new directions, ultimately leading to one of six unique endings. In all, Colony Wars: Vengeance spans over 40 missions, arranged into 19 different ""acts."" Unlocking the game\'s most desirable ending automatically rewards the player with the entire mission tree, which allows you to dish out some serious payback by replaying any of the previous missions - with the ship of your choice - infusing Colony Wars: Vengeance with an uncommon amount of replay value.', 'The real question, however, is whether or not the average player will possess the patience and persistence to make it that far. Severely unbalanced missions (the fifth Sentinel is a breeze compared with the second) and an almost insane level of difficulty undoubtedly will have many gamers, if not most, flinging their controllers in disgust long before the game\'s halfway point, which really is a pity; a more gradual ""ramping"" of the level of difficulty would have made the game more enjoyable and accessible to casual gamers while allowing them to experience more of the game\'s visual fireworks and story elements. By the time I reached the game\'s supposedly climactic plot twist, I was simply too beaten down to care much about Mertens anymore.', ""As for Colony Wars: Vengeance's cosmetic improvements, I gladly would have traded all of them for a two-player cooperative or head-to-head mode. A cooperative mode, in particular, would have killed two birds with one stone by making the game easier while allowing a friend to join in the fun."", ""Despite its flaws, the game's head-turning graphics, diversity, and uncommonly developed story propel Colony Wars: Vengeance light years ahead of the average space shooter.

Monkey Hero,,['Monkey Hero'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation']",{},"['With an eye for excitement and a nose for nonsense Monkey Hero is one funky monkey. Join monkey as he explores massive dungeons and battles legions of baddies in a crusade to restore peace among the three worlds.', 'Sometimes even the best intentions go to waste, and Monkey Hero is an unfortunate testament to this. Intended as a Japanese-style action/RPG in the old-school vein of Zelda, Monkey Hero is just about as ill conceived and poorly done as one can imagine, and it\'s only made more lamentable by its purported homage to the classics. <P>Loosely based on Chinese lore, Monkey Hero follows the mythic exploits of one ""Monkey"" and his quest to return balance to the dream world, waking world and nightmare world and defeat the uniform-clad Nightmare King. To do so, Monkey must travel across the world to retrieve the eight chapters of a magic story book. Monkey Hero\'s gameplay is, unfortunately, below the generic level of the game\'s story. Inspired by the Zelda series and games of its ilk, Monkey Hero takes a broad stab at the action/adventure genre and provides Monkey with all the requisite tools, heart-container-equivalents and the like to complete his quest. Complete with a bird\'s-eye view of the ""action,"" Monkey hero is Blam!\'s attempt to implement every classically tested variable of the action/adventure formula. <P>However, that formula has yet to produce so painful a game. Monkey Hero\'s gameplay is often bad, occasionally mediocre, and thoroughly boring throughout. To start, one could make a case that the game\'s world is too big. This is a problem only because the game makes very little attempt to provide you with direction; often you are left to wander around, either looking for the next item or the next obstacle to remove. There has to be a better way than this to move away from the traditional linearity of the action/adventure genre. There\'s nothing like getting a new item and looking for one place to use it, only to find five, most of which are dead ends. Monkey Hero is a fairly long game, and it\'s full of these design inadequacies. Should you manage to progress, you\'ll find the game\'s dungeons to be lacking. Between the bland layout and the sparse, uninventive use of puzzles, Monkey Hero\'s dungeons are more exercises in tedium than actual gameplay. Some of the bosses are worthwhile, but they are short-lived, and seem like token reasons to use the game\'s myriad items instead of actual challenges. Additionally, control and collision issues seem to plague the game, adding additional frustration to the poor design. <P>Alas, Monkey Hero\'s problems don\'t end there. Aesthetically, the game is a mess: It looks like a shareware throwback to the first generation of PlayStation games. The game\'s tile-heavy graphics are reminiscent of Interplay\'s abysmal Loaded, unfortunately borrowing that game\'s lighting extremes, as well. Areas are often inexplicably dark, but often have near-invisible enemies lurking in them, generally resulting in cheap hits. The game\'s terrain is flat and uninteresting, and all the art is decidedly blocky. Monkey Hero anachronistically relies on sprites for enemies, and they\'re not pretty, either. In addition to being small and of basic geometry, their animation is unforgivably poor, rarely more than a few frames. Despite the game\'s extremely basic 3D graphics, the frame rate is decidedly poor on the whole, slowing down at the most inopportune and inexplicable times. <P>Coupled with the poor animation is an extremely poor use of sound. When you use the hammer item, there\'s no earth-shaking thud to accompany the animation. Additionally, most of the game\'s music is repetitive and used in far too many instances, not to mention that it doesn\'t really carry the game\'s professed Asian overtones. <P>However it happened, Blam!\'s pure intentions went chaotically awry, resulting in one of the worst PlayStation games in recent memory. Blam! knows the classics - here\'s hoping they can mimic them a lot better next time. --Peter Bartholow <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Knockout Kings,,['EA Sports'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Pulse-pounding excitement in the first great boxing game for PlayStation. And only the experts at EA Sports could bring it to you! Knockout Kings features 38 of history's greatest fighters including Sugar Ray Leonard Evander Holyfield even the Greatest Muhammed Ali! How would Ali fare against Evander? Find out! With refereeing by Mills Lane there'll be no ear-biting either! It's just like a real boxing match --except no pay-per-view charges!"", 'Knockout Kings is not only the first boxing game released here in the States for the PlayStation, but is also the most accurate representation of the sport of boxing in a video game to date, though it still has plenty of room for improvement. One area that doesn\'t need any improvement is its authenticity. The game has 38 boxers from the light, middle, and heavyweight divisions from the past and present including Evander Holyfield, Ike Quartey, Lennox Lewis, Michael Moore, Shane Mosley, Oscar De La Hoya, ""Sugar"" Ray Leonard, and Muhammad Ali. For even further authenticity the designers have included real-life venues to fight at like Caesar\'s Palace and Madison Square Garden. <P>You can select from three modes of play. Exhibition allows you to pick your favorite fighters and go at it. Slugfest, which is an arcade-style mode, allows you to pick any two fighters from any weight division and slug it out in a match with exaggerated knockdowns and punches. The career mode lets you create your own boxer from scratch and try to take him from the bottom of the ranks to the top for a shot at the title. In this mode you have 30 generic fighters that you must face. Before each fight you can select what type of training you would like to do. You can select between working the heavy bag, which improves your power, or hitting the speed bag, which helps your speed. Unfortunately, this is merely something to watch for a minute.  <P>Visually, Knockout Kings is simple but effective. The fighters are made up of 3D polygons, but they don\'t look like the typical boxy polygonal characters we see in most games. Instead, the fighters have smooth, realistic-looking bodies, with shoulder and elbow joints that work accurately. The animations of the punches, knockdowns, taunts, and general ring movement also look great. Also, most of the fighters look like their real-life counterparts, not only in facial features but also in body size and motion. The only negative aspect of the graphics is the crowd, which is basically just a still picture. Although the sound of a roaring audience almost makes that still image come to life.  <P>All of the sound effects are fairly accurate. The punches, referee, and fighters\' grunts are all pretty good. But what makes Knockout Kings sound so real are the real voices of Al Albert and Sean O\'Grady of Tuesday Night Fights fame, who provide commentary during the matches, though their vocabulary is unfortunately a bit on the limited side, as they pretty much just stick to saying ""nice (insert name of punch here)"" again and again. Knockout Kings also has the voice talents of ring announcer Jimmy Lennon Jr. and referee Mills Lane as a nice touch for big fights. When you\'re climbing the ranks you have generic refs and ring announcers that work the matches. <P>On the control side of things the game feels a bit sticky because you have to get used to the amount of time that it takes for the animations of different punches. But once you get the hang of how the fighters move around the ring, it\'s not a problem. However, the game only has three control configurations. And the simulation control setup isn\'t what I would consider an ideal setup. The D-pad handles ring movement, you have a left jab button, right cross button, body blow button, and an uppercut button. You can pull off little preset combos, power hooks, and low blows by holding a shoulder button while pressing another button. You can even head-butt your opponent (no, there\'s no ear biting). When defending, you can block high and low, bob and weave, duck, clinch, and shove your opponent away. All of these moves are executed by hitting various button and D-pad combinations. While the preset button configurations get the job done, it would have been better if you could assign specific punches to the button of your choice. The AI of the computer boxers is fairly decent. As in real life, there are two main types: boxers and punchers. Toward the top of the ranks the opposition gets a little tougher, since each opponent seems to be able to hurt you with just about any punch and is nearly impervious to damage. <P>Overall, Knockout Kings is the best representation of the sport of boxing in a game so far. Although it is missing some of the little nuances of real boxing.  It\'s easier for a die-hard boxing fanatic to see all of the little things it could have done a touch better; like parrying, working the angles, and punching power balance. The casual boxing fan probably won\'t notice and will think that it\'s the best boxing game of all time. Which is true, though it\'s still missing a few things that keep it from being the perfect boxing sim. Any boxing fan will love Knockout Kings, and being one myself, I just hope that Electronic Arts continues the series and keeps making it better. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

WCW Nitro,,['N64'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['Step into the ring as one of your favorite WCW or NWO superstars! You can choose to battle it out in tag team action or take on the oppostion by yourself. Many of your favorites are here featuring the likes of Hollywood Hogan Lex Luger and many more. Each wrestler has many devastating moves to choose from including unique special moves for each wrestler.', ""Until now, all the WCW-licensed games on the N64 have been based on a Japanese engine used by Asmik in a couple of overseas wrestling games. These games have been tolerable from a gameplay standpoint, but none of them ever really captured the look or feel of actual WCW wrestling. Meanwhile, PlayStation owners have been getting WCW games that look a bit more like the real thing, but the gameplay has been atrociously bad. Now, N64 owners can experience the weak gameplay of the PlayStation WCW games mixed with a bit of the real look and feel of the PlayStation games, though the inadequate storage space of the N64 cartridge keeps some of the atmosphere out of the game. <P>This is essentially a slightly updated version of the WCW Nitro that appeared on the PlayStation. The gameplay remains the same, but the roster has been updated, and wrestlers like Bill Goldberg have been added to the lineup. Gone from the original are the short taunt videos, which, by the way, were the best thing about the PlayStation version of the game. Also gone from the original are the poorly pixelated character graphics. Here, the wrestler models are very sharp, though the skin textures look quite bad. The crowd also looks really, really terrible. The game moves a lot quicker than the PlayStation version, but this gives the game a really strange look - it seems as though the motion-captured animation is simply running too fast. <P>For those unfamiliar with the original version of the game, Nitro eschews the tie-up system of gameplay used by previous WCW games, as well as WWF Warzone, for a different, move-based style. Instead of tying up and pounding buttons to pull off moves, you execute the moves via a series of button presses. When this game came out for the PlayStation, it was nice to see someone trying something new in wrestling games, even if it wasn't too spectacular. But now that THQ has milked this style of gameplay for three games, it's way past its prime. <P>Gameplay modes include the standard championship, which pits you against ten different opponents, one at a time. Win and you're the champion. Lose and you'll get to continue. There's also a tag-team mode and a battle royal, which forces you to toss your opponents over the top rope to eliminate them. <P>WCW Nitro is just a rehash of the PlayStation version, only it's about a year too late. It may have worked as a simultaneous release, but now the game is just plain bad. Even roster updates can't save it from its horrible gameplay and shoddy appearance. Let's hope EA can put out a decent WCW-licensed wrestling game when it takes over the license later this year. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter,,[],[],{},"['There have been several disagreements between the Marvel Superheroes and the Street Fighters. There are roomers but no one is sure what has ignited the feud. One thing is certain though it will not be settled by using diplomacy! The fiercest tag team fighting action taken straight from the fired-up arcade version is now available for your PSX. There will be no compromise no mercy and no remorse. This is no holds-barred 2D fighting like only Capcom can bring.', ""I've been a big fan of the Street Fighter series since its outset. And to be quite honest, playing Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter only reminds me of how great the series used to be. Sure, the game is mildly entertaining, but without the true tag team gameplay that the arcade version of the game had, it comes off as just another Street Fighter game with Marvel characters.  <P>The character roster totals out at 17, with nine from the Street Fighter universe and eight from Marvel. There are five modes of play including battle, versus, training, hero battle, and crossover. Battle and versus are your typical one- and two-player fighting game modes. Hero Battle is an endurance mode that separates the groups to see which has the stronger stable of fighters. Nothing special here. Crossover mode, however, is at least somewhat interesting. You see, in the original version of MSH vs. SF you could pick two fighters whom you could switch between at any time during the fight. This tag team style of fighting was first featured in the arcade version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter but couldn't make it into the PlayStation port due to the technical limitations of the PlayStation. Sadly, the tag team aspect of MSH vs. SF was also excluded for the same reason. Sure, you can still pick two characters, but you can only play as one of them. The second character only comes into play when you execute a team combo or team counter. Crossover mode tries to bring the game's main selling point home. This mode allows you to pick two characters, then the computer uses the same characters you picked. This limits the amount of information the PlayStation has to handle to two characters instead of four. If you are victorious in this battle, the computer swaps one of the characters each of you have for another. This is done so that you aren't playing with and against the same two characters each fight. It gives you the tag team experience of the arcade, but having to deal with the rotating character thing and having to fight mirror images of yourself is extremely weak.  <P>Visually, MSH vs. SF looks good. But when you compare it with its arcade counterpart, it simply fails. The colors aren't nearly as vibrant, and the game suffers from quite a bit of slowdown. It still comes across better than the PlayStation version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter, though, because not nearly as much animation was cut out. This is a major plus, since frames of animation not only affect the game's appearance but timing and gameplay as well. <P>On the gameplay side, Street Fighter fans will definitely feel the typical Street Fighter gameplay. But in the end, it's all a question of how starved you are for another Street Fighter game. Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is all about the tag team mode, and with the overall exclusion of this mode, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is just another Street Fighter game. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Bust-A-Move '99,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['Game Cartridge ONLY. No box or instruction manual included. Game and label are in very good condition, game is tested and works great.', ""Acclaim's Bust-A-Move 99 brought little to the series on the PlayStation, aside from a hefty collection of homemade puzzles and a sparsely entertaining edit mode. However, the Taito-created Nintendo 64 version of essentially the same game delivers what most puzzles game fans want most - more in terms of multiplayer mode, along with a few additional features added since Acclaims Bust-A-Move 2 Arcade Edition that came out on the N64 this time last year - namely, a collection, a four-player mode, and an edit mode. There are five modes of play in all. Arcade mode is the arcade conversion of Bust-A-Move 3, with a puzzle option, in which a single player works through the levels without an opponent, neither human nor CPU. There is also a player vs. computer mode, and a player vs. player mode for two-player challenges. The challenge mode is a single-player match where you solve about 25 puzzles. Your success will be evaluated at the end. The win contest mode is another player vs. CPU game. The collection mode is basically what you saw (or might have seen) in Natsume's Bust-A-Move 3. A bunch of people of no discernable age made puzzles for Taito, and more than one thousand of these ended up in the final game. These puzzles usually take just seconds each to get through, and a good handful of them require little more than one to four shots (or turns) to complete. The ones that take longer seem nearly impossible, poorly constructed, and are likely the craftwork of some mean, disturbed little child with a vengeance. The good thing is, you don't have to complete one collection puzzle to move on to the next. You can sample them all and simply skip the ones you don't like.  <P>The last option in the N64 version, like in the PlayStation game, is the edit mode. The puzzle-building components aren't exactly complex, but they can be quite addictive. You select from a handful of primary and secondary colors, then throw in clear bubbles, stars, block bubbles, and so on. The screen can be adjusted for wide-screen or regular play, and you can save about 25 of your puzzles to a memory card to progressively work through. The interface for constructing puzzles is basic and intuitive, and it is actually pretty fun to try to determine what makes for a good puzzle - easy or difficult. The problem is, it's just as easy to construct a simple puzzle that brings bubbles smashing down in two moves as it is to build an extremely difficult puzzle by alternating colors and never grouping two together - which can be disappointing. <P>Where Bust-A-Move 99 for the N64 really shines is in the three- or four-player modes. These modes are engaging enough to keep you playing after you've long since tired of a simple two-player game. One complaint, however, is that (in what appears to be an obvious developer oversight) you're stuck with four game spaces on the TV monitor, whether you're in a three-player or four-player game. Because of this, the screens are really tiny, with silly pictures of your respective character under your playing space taking up about one fifth of your panel of the monitor. This makes no sense. Clearly, resolution issues were at play, but why not just present three spaces for a three-player game?                    The N64 version, like the PlayStation game, suffered from the occasional cluttered background, making the bubbles occassionally difficult to see. However, this wasn't consistently the case and therefore didn't really damage gameplay. And aside from a few sound glitches between levels, the cartridge didn't do much to damage the music. Could it, anyway?  <P>A minor, yet positive, note: Taito held on to the subtle control feature introduced in Bust-A-Move 2 for the N64. That is, besides analog/digital control options, you can use the left and right shoulder buttons to move the bubble projector ever so slightly, as opposed to a complete move with the stick or the D-pad. The game is Rumble Pak compatible, too. <P>So really, the way to play Bust-A-Move 99 on the N64 and get the most out of it is to play the four-player mode (just sit close to the TV) and learn the characters well. Bubbloon is no doubt the most charismatic of the lot, but the other characters have pretty decent fighting patterns, so to speak. For example, SSB will drop sets of and Jack will drop the tough to dispel rainbows and the impossible to rid blocks on your partner every time you clear a set or more of bubbles. When you're playing against three other players, each with different characters, learning and following the strategies of each adds a lot of value to the game.  <P>Overall, Bust-A-Move 99 for the N64, like the PlayStation version, is neither a revolutionary take on puzzle games nor a unique take on its own series. Yet it's a good game that will likely satisfy fans of the arcade game, as well as puzzle-game fans in general. If you have both systems and you're considering which version to buy, choose this one because of the multiplayer mode - the Nintendo 64 library is not brimming with cool multiplayer puzzle games. If you aren't familiar with the series, you don't have a PlayStation, and you simply want to know if it's worth your while, you can't go wrong picking this one up. --Lauren Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

But the changes and additions are more than enough reason to pick it up."", ""One of the biggest improvements over last year's NHL title is the control. The Dual Shock analog support really gives you the feel of gliding down the ice. In addition, now when you collide with a player on the ice or smash into the glass, the controller vibrates. You can still use the digital pad of course, but the smooth nature of the analog controller really does lend itself perfectly to skating."", ""Graphically, NHL 99 isn't leaps and bounds better, but it is a little cleaner. The frame rate is still pretty bad, but it doesn't hinder the game too much. EA wanted the animation of the players on the ice to be as true to life as possible, so it went and got real NHL players to provide the motion for the skating and goalie animations in the game. The result is a smoother, more accurate look to the players' movements than has been seen previously."", 'The play-by-play calls and commentary from NHL broadcasters Daryl Reaugh and Jim Hughson really add some flavor to the game, as does the stadium announcer, who calls out over the PA every once in a while to tell you how tasty the food is at the snack bar.

While the 32-bit offerings have been good, they haven\'t really captured the fun of the old 16-bit versions. This is EA\'s first N64 version of Live, and the result is a pretty good game with a lot of options.', ""Like previous Lives, you can customize just about every feature, right down to which fouls get called and which are ignored. So you can make the game as complex as the real thing or strip it down to the basics and play it like a five-on-five version of NBA Jam. An arcade setting turns on superhuman dunks, burning hoops, and incredibly stupid cartoon noises to accompany gameplay. Aside from the usual exhibition, season, and play-off games, there is also a three-point shooting contest, reminiscent of the one found in EA's classic Jordan vs. Bird: One on One. On the managerial side, you can trade and release players, making them free agents, to build your own superteam. You can also create players at will to place on your modified teams."", 'The gameplay is standard for the genre. You can play it with two or three buttons, but every single button on the controller does something. So if you want to pull off advanced maneuvers, they\'re reasonably easy to execute. Icon passing and defensive player selection are in the game, and you can call different offensive and defensive sets. You can, of course, leave the play calling to the computer if you wish. The AI of your teammates is pretty good. They\'ll shuffle around the court in an attempt to get open, and they\'ll defend the basket pretty well, though they aren\'t aggressive enough to get many steals. The opposing team AI ranges from moronic (rookie) to ""just set the controller down, because you don\'t have a chance"" (superstar).', 'The graphics in Live are nice, although the animation looks a little jerky. Sound-wise, Live is great, with the exception of the (thankfully) easily disabled arcade mode sounds. The cartoon running and bouncing noises are incredibly lame.

The original NHL Hockey was such a good game, that it actually turned me into a hockey fan. How has the series held up over the years? Pretty well. There have been a few versions that have left out the casual sports gamer, taking a more complex route. NHL 99 retains the outstanding gameplay of the original 16-bit games, but gives you lots of options, allowing you make the game as simple or as complex as you want.', ""For starters, you can disable just about all the rules, including icing, two-line passes, offsides, and those pesky interference calls. Other options include player trading, which also includes the ability to make your own players. Gameplay modes include all the modes we've come to expect from modern-day sports titles. Exhibition games allow you to dive right in and play a meaningless game, while season mode and championship mode allow you to give your games a little more meaning. There is also a shootout mode, which allows you to practice your breakaways in a penalty shot competition."", ""The gameplay is extremely simple to learn, though there are advanced options that you can learn, also. At its most simplistic, NHL 99 requires the use of only three buttons. However, decide to control your own goalie, call some offensive or defensive plays, or change lines, and you'll find that the game can get really complex. Still, the control is really great. The analog controller really allows for precision skating. The AI in the game (based on last year's PlayStation version) is reasonably good and scales pretty well to fit the difficulty setting."", 'The graphics in NHL 99 work really well. The skating and checking animations are all pretty nice, and the game runs at a nice, smooth frame rate. The sound, unfortunately, doesn\'t come off as well. Sure, the actual sounds of hockey are pretty good, but the announcer really kills it. It seems like he only says about eight different things.

Point Blank 2,,"['1-8 Players', 'Arcade Mode', 'Theme Park Mode', 'Party Mode and Endurance Mode']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['If you\'ve ever played the arcade version of Namco\'s Point Blank (or Gun Bullet, as it\'s called in Japan) or the import version for the PlayStation, then you likely know just how many tokens you can go through or how many restarts you initiate in a very short amount of time. This puzzle/shooter title, which sometimes unmercifully lets you have only one bullet and five seconds to complete a task, can be replayed free, endlessly, and to perfection, as it\'s now available for the Sony PlayStation - in English. <P>Point Blank portrays the story of two gun-slinging companeros and adventurers, Dr. Don and Dr. Dan, who look amazingly like Sesame Street\'s Bert and Ernie after a healthy dose of Rogaine and about 20 years hard time. You adopt their collective identity throughout the single-player and two-player head-to-head score-battle mode. Once you select your experience level, beginner, intermediate, or expert, get comfortable with and calibrate your GunCon, as this is the third US title to be compatible with the accurate-within-three-pixels light gun. From this point, a jumble of four distinct challenges from within a larger grouping will be presented to you. Select one of them, and the game starts. <P>There\'s no logical progression to the difficulty of these levels, as they each tend to measure a different skill set. Some of them, for example, test your accuracy by giving you a single bullet and ten seconds to shoot an apple off a guy\'s head or blast a feather floating down from the sky. The expert level may find you trying the same task with less available time or perhaps an object moving more quickly. Other stages may test your speed and judgment - making you shoot scores of ""bad guys"" or ninjas within a given time limit. You\'ll have unlimited ammo on these levels, but rapid fire won\'t help you. You see, there are civilians you must avoid, or you\'ll lose a life for each one you kill. And generally, unless you change things around in the options menu, you only live thrice. Another grouping of levels encourages rapid fire. In these challenges, you\'ll have a varying time limit and an unlimited amount of ammunition to either do such things as totally destroy a sports car or shoot a bunch of bottles off the wall. Still another skill test is the target objective. Marks in the pattern of plates or shooting-range forms will be displayed to you, and you\'ll have a time limit and occasionally an ammo allotment to complete your goal. For example, you must shoot down all plates of a certain color, while avoiding ""bomb"" decoys, or hit a bull\'s-eye to secure a high score. <P>You won\'t always be reaching for a numerical score rewarding target accuracy or destroying the appropriate number of objects. You\'ll also have puzzles and missions to conquer - with your gun (who said violence couldn\'t solve problems?). This might entail shooting the keys of a keyboard to spell out words; figuring out which part of the fast-moving Chinese dragon to hit; determining which bouncing balls to cap to clear the lot of them; shooting out a numerical sequence from a scrambled keypad; annihilating all the vultures, piranhas, tanks, meteorites, and fireballs before they exterminate your buddy; and knocking the hives off a tree before killing all the bees. And if after all this you haven\'t had enough diversity, various Whack-a-Mole-style levels will prompt you to shoot cuckoo clock birds and fuzzy animals as they emerge and disappear - rather quickly - in and out of their abodes, tag-teaming with bombs that will tempt your anxious reflexes. <P>The stages are incredibly irresistible and fun, luring you into a seemingly endless stream of continues until you either succeed at a challenge or get a red flag for that level and move on to the next. If you fail, you\'ll lose one life and continue with the set until you\'re dead. Whether you win or lose a level, you\'ll get a certain number of points for how hard you tried (or how long you managed to stay alive). Once you finish four levels, you\'ll get four more until you either die or the difficulty level is complete - at which point, you fight the final battle and disappear into a flurry of fireworks and adulation when you win. <P>Single-player and head-to-head score competitions aside, Point Blank for the PlayStation tops the arcade version by offering tournament and team-play modes, in which up to four players compete in turn-based rounds of the previously listed levels until either a team or an individual wins. A special mode offers variations on the already disparate stages, and a quest mode extends RPG-like play - much in the style of Soul Blade, where you (as the team of Dr. Dan and Dr. Don) collect experience points and money for battles you encounter as you wander around a tropical oasis called Point Blank Island. The point of this quest is to beat Quickbuck, the evil head of the Scrimp \'n\' Save Corporation, to the Gunball. You do this by succeeding at a series of shooting challenges, basically variations on the stages from other modes, and you encounter them as you explore a 2D environment. Quest mode is definitely a fast-moving RPG, but it pretty much has to be, as who wants to hold his arms poised to shoot for hours on end? The translations in quest mode are a little rough, too, as you\'re told to ""best"" certain bosses, not ""beat"" them, as well as test your ""shoothing"" skills. But this is not a puzzle game disguised as an RPG, as the RPG standards, such as purchasable rejuvenating potions (in the form of hamburgers, here) and stepped-up weapons and so on, are all components of the Point Blank Quest.  <P>Point Blank\'s graphics are nothing to chirp about, and the music sounds like it comes from a kid-weary shopping-mall floor-sample synthesizer. But amazingly, Namco\'s managed to capture and apply the addictive elements of puzzle and shooting games, creating a title that is so enjoyable and difficult to put down you won\'t be bothered by the audiovisual shortcomings. --Lauren Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

R4's asphalt gulping graphics and spectacular racing environments deliver racing speeds that were once deemed impossible."", ""No matter how great you think Gran Turismo, Need for Speed, or any other driving game is, Ridge Racer has always been the preferred series when it comes to arcade-style driving. Though Rage Racer introduced some simulation aspects off the track, the on-track experience maintained the same powerslide-happy gameplay that PlayStation owners have loved since the system launched. Ridge Racer Type 4 (or R4, for short) makes plenty of improvements while maintaining the same basic feel. <P>The game's main mode is the grand prix, where you pick one of four teams and one of four car manufacturers, then race on eight tracks. Each team has its own little storyline that plays out between races, which is told through conversation with your team liaison. What your team liaison says to you changes depending on how well you do. The first two tracks only require you to place third or higher. The second heat requires you to finish second or higher, while the last four tracks require you to finish first to proceed. You can retry each track up to three times before having to start the entire heat over again. You'll earn a newer, faster car as you complete in each heat and one more before the final race. Which car you get depends on how well you did in the previous races. If you aced the entire heat, and you'll get a faster, better car than you would if you'd finished third in one or more races. These cars can be used in the two-player versus mode or the time-trial mode. Also, an extra trial is unlocked for each car manufacturer as you beat the game with the various cars. <P>There are two basic types of cars in the game. Drift cars are meant for powersliding, while the grip cars use their additional traction to make most turns without needing to lay down any rubber. The drift cars can maneuver the courses more quickly than the grip cars, but the grip cars let you compete, even though you might not have mastered the art of the slide. Also, Namco's Jogcon controller really brings a lot to the game. The addition of the small wheel makes the control a lot more intuitive, as well as providing valuable feedback (start doing thumb exercises now) that helps you know exactly when to power out of a turn. The track design still revolves around making only a few different tracks, and using variations to deliver different courses, but the rehashing of tracks doesn't stand out nearly as much as it did in the previous Ridge Racer games. <P>The graphics are simply great. The game moves at a very high, smooth frame rate, and the tracks are filled with detail. Lighting is also well used, and things like brake lights give off tracers in tunnels. The graphics aren't perfect, though. You can sometimes see the opposing cars through walls, and the brake lights occasionally appear in the road if you're approaching the top of a hill and another car is near the bottom of the hill. The soundtrack is a bit more mellow than the previous games, but it still fits into the game perfectly. <P>Above all, R4 is incredibly fun to play. Unlocking the cars (more than 300 in all, though most are basic variations on a few common themes) quickly becomes an obsession, and the Jogcon adds a ton of depth to the game's control. Sure, you can play with a Dual Shock or even a standard controller, but the Jogcon is definitely the way to play. If you've ever cared about any of the games in the Ridge Racer series, then R4 is definitely the racing game for you. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

It's a battle-racing game like you've never seen!"", ""The undeniable urge to race has struck many a platform- and puzzle-game hero. It hit Mega Man in the Japanese release Rockman: Battle & Chase and Square's cutesy-cutesy Chocobo in Chocobo Racing. It's even happened to Mario twice now. Since Bomberman has long been known to play with fire and explosives, it was really just a matter of time before he added the track to his long list of vices. <P>So, this is where it's all gotten him. The bomb-chucking star of Hudson's genre-defying series and several of his friends have saddled up on Tiras (the worried-looking hippo-dinosaur hybrids) and Louies (the excitable kangaroo creatures introduced several games back), and they are competing in races for money and fame. In the single-player mode, you race against four opponents, drop or throw bombs at them, and use power-ups found along the way. (Just about everything is here, from power bombs to triple bombs; plus, there are a few new items as well). Using a feature available in a number of Japan-only horseracing video games, you can make your mount sprint ahead for short distances until it tires. If you come in first, second, or third, you'll get cash. Make enough, and you can buy extra power-ups, better Tiras and Louies, and gain entrance into the next race. In the two-player split-screen mode, you can make a bet and race against a friend. <P>The graphics are a bit plain for this generation of PlayStation games, and pop-up and build are an issue, of course, but it's not a horrible-looking game. The music in BFR alternates between sounding like a speeded-up tape and an imported electronic toy - ultimately, these sounds earn the game points for quirkiness. Altogether, the game's not very long, very good, or very bad - which at least wins it the dubious distinction of being the best Bomberman game on the PlayStation to date. If you're a fan of Bomberman or Mario Kart, it's worth renting, but it's a little too short, and the tracks are a little too simple to warrant a more long-term relationship. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

3 Xtreme,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['3 Extreme rocks your PlayStation with an all new 3D game engine featuring lifelike characters and panoramic 3D courses. 32 environments include narrow subways beautiful parks pristine coastlines slick riverbeds and tropical islands.', 'The Xtreme games have always been a mediocre racing series at best, but now, with the release of 3Xtreme, the series has hit an all-time low. The sprite-based graphics have been replaced with 3D polygons that actually manage to look worse than the sprites. Only six racers can race together, and the polygonal racers and environments don\'t look good. It still plays like the previous Xtreme games but you\'d still be better off with the original than you would with this.  <P>All of the familiar modes of play are still here. You can choose from three different types of ""extreme"" sports equipment: bikes, skates, and skateboards. Each of these can be used in any one of the game\'s four modes: season, exhibition, time trials, and freestyle. Two players can play exhibition, freestyle, and time trials simultaneously. The season mode is the main single-player mode. You race through a season composed of three circuits. The first has six races, the second eight, and the third ten. You and five other racers compete for the top three positions for season standing points. The better you do, the more points you have to spend on better equipment, which will, of course, help you win more races. By winning the circuits you also unlock extra competitors, courses, and equipment. There are 27 courses in all, with about 13 different racers to use. Each racer has his own unique abilities, which are shown on the select screen. Some are better at flat-out racing, while others are better at performing tricks.  3Xtreme\'s control scheme and overall play mechanic are terribly executed. The major problem, controlwise, is that the D-pad is used in conjunction with the shoulder buttons, making it super hard to come off a ramp or land at the angle you want. Most of the time you instinctively try to correct your racer\'s landing but end up making him perform a trick a foot above the ground. This trick setup causes nothing but frustration and pain. On top of that, the D-pad moves the character so slowly that you\'re almost always using the hard-turn button.    <P>Visually, 3Xtreme is a mess. The 3D models used for the characters are extremely blocky. The environments and objects also look bad. The frame rate is constantly going up and down, which actually makes the game hard to play. When you\'re lining up to go through a gate, the frame rate shoots up and your character moves too far to one side. The only neat visual thing in the game is the beautifully edited FMV intro video that shows some amazing tricks and crashes. <P>In the audio department, there are a few cool, fast-paced songs that get you pumped, but a lot of the sound effects are very weak. All you hear during the race is a bunch of oohs and ahhs from the racers, who are always slamming into something.  <P>In the end, there isn\'t one redeeming thing about 3Xtreme that would warrant buying the game. If you are a die-hard fan of the previous games and just have to know for yourself, do yourself a favor and rent the game first. After playing the game for 30 minutes you\'ll be wishing you had rented something else. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Mortal Kombat Gold,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"['Mortal Kombat Gold is the latest, in the hugely successful Mortal Kombat fighting series.  The game features 15 favorite MK characters plus the surprise reintroduction of several favorites.  There are more than 10 interactive fighting arenas, multiple game fight modes, several fatality methods for each character, a brand new weapon select screen, fully rendered intros and endings plus Dreamcast exclusive surprises.  Release currently scheduled for October 1999 (subject to change).', ""The Mortal Kombat series has been around for a pretty long time, and it's spawned lots of different spin-offs, including action figures, movies, and a TV show. We've even seen a spin-off game based solely on Sub-Zero. This ultra-violent fighting-game series has its share of fans, as well as its share of detractors. Regardless of your stance, Mortal Kombat Gold is sure to test even the biggest fan's faith in the line. <P>It's not that MK Gold is a bad game or anything. It's an outstandingly accurate translation of Mortal Kombat 4, with a few new characters thrown in for good measure. But the new characters don't really bring anything stellar to the lineup, and you're left with a game that you were finished playing around with back when it came out on the N64 and the PlayStation more than a year ago. <P>The game really does come across as a perfect port of the arcade game, though it also has all the extras the other console versions have, like the Ice Pit level and Goro, as well as the rendered FMV endings that had been featured on the PlayStation. Load times are next to nothing, and the graphics and sound are on par with the arcade version. Even though it's a perfect port of the arcade version, the graphics look pretty dated, especially when compared with some of the other Dreamcast launch titles. <P>The Dreamcast-specific features include the presence of some older MK characters, namely Cyrax, Mileena, Kitana, Baraka, and Kung Lao. All of them retain their older moves, though Kung Lao's hat toss is no longer controllable, and the moves for Cyrax's bombs are done slightly differently. Also, the 3D nature of this Mortal Kombat renders Cyrax's bombs nearly useless, since you can simply sidestep them and escape their blast. With the new characters come new endings, and like the other endings, they aren't anything special. The characters in the new endings have strangely elongated necks, and their heads seem to bobble around like those weird baseball figurines. <P>The game's AI is vintage Mortal Kombat, so it's chock-full of the same stimulus-response style that forces you to rely on the same cheap tactics to defeat the computer opponents. There's also a weapon-select menu on the character-select screen that lets you choose which weapon you want to take into battle, but between two skilled competitors, the weapons won't come into play very often. The game's generic combo system ensures that anyone picking up the game will be able to pull off three or four hit combos almost immediately. It also ensures that unless you're a huge Mortal Kombat fan, you'll get tired of the game pretty quickly. The Dreamcast controller does a decent job here, but some of the fatalities require you to hit multiple buttons, which can be a pretty finger-twisting feat on the gamepad. <P>Sitting down and playing MK Gold almost feels like a retrogaming experience - you really feel as though you've pulled out some old game that you haven't played in years - and it hasn't aged gracefully. If you're still interested in Mortal Kombat 4, then MK Gold should provide some sort of thrill. But the rest of the MK fans that have already moved on to bigger and better things will just have to wait patiently for Mortal Kombat 5. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Silhouette Mirage,,"['Side Scrolling Action Game', 'Multiple Endings', 'Made by the masters at Treasure', 'Published by Working Designs']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['After more than a year of delays, Working Designs has finally delivered Silhouette Mirage. This isn\'t the same Silhouette Mirage that debuted on the Saturn nearly three years ago, however - the game has somehow transformed from a delightfully quirky platforming romp into an average, unbalanced, and tedious exercise meant for ""hard-core gamers."" In typical Treasure fashion, Silhouette Mirage\'s 2D gameplay is integrated with a lot of story and dialogue. The Edo computer system has malfunctioned, splitting the world\'s creatures into two opposing classes, Silhouette and Mirage. In the midst of a massive civil war between these two factions, a lone guardian possessing both attributes, Shyna Nera Shyna, wakes to set the Edo system right. Unfortunately, the memory of the Edo system\'s location was lost during Shyna\'s long slumber, forcing her to entrust her fate to a bug, a friendly Mirage summoner. In her quest, Shyna will face some of the weirdest and most evil characters to ever grace gaming. Silhouette Mirage\'s game mechanics are certainly innovative, if a little complex. Each of Shyna\'s two sides embodies one of the attributes of Silhouette and Mirage, as do all weapons, depending on which side is facing the enemy. Only the Mirage side of a weapon can injure Silhouette enemies and vice versa. All of the game\'s parasitic weapons, bought from rabbity salesmen scattered throughout the game, are powered by Shyna\'s spirit level. As weapons are fired, Shyna\'s spirit level drops, weakening her attacks as it diminishes. You can refill your spirit meter by draining enemies of their spirit energy, done by attacking Mirage enemies with Mirage weapons and vice versa. Dealing with Shyna\'s split personality is made easier through a variety of strategic throws, slides, and flips to manipulate the enemy\'s position relative to Shyna so the appropriate side can attack. Fortunately, the game provides you with an extensive tutorial illustrating and training you to pull off all of these moves. In addition to the strategic moves, Shyna can grapple enemies with her hair and beat money from their pockets - money that can be used to buy new weapons, health, and spirit energy. Confused yet? It\'s normal - Silhouette Mirage\'s complex play mechanics take some getting used to, and fully understanding the Silhouette/Mirage concept is crucial to winning the game, especially when fighting the game\'s awesome bosses. The need to drain enemies of their spirit energy is new to the US version and is the single greatest flaw in the game. Not only does this force you to constantly ration firepower, it also weakens your weapons as you fire them. As a result, a weapon will oftentimes not be there when you need it most. Compounding this problem is the inflated cost of weapons. The US version significantly ups the price of the game\'s weapons, forcing you to beat each and every enemy if you want a half-decent arsenal. As a result, the price for using weapons other than the boring one you start with is precipitously high and will cause some players to opt in favor of simply not buying weapons for most of the game. Additionally, if you want to succeed in the game, expect to spend lots of time tediously robbing and draining every enemy before you kill it. A new two-player battle mode is unlocked if you complete all five of the game\'s paths with fewer than nine lives, but this little doodad is hardly worth the boredom and effort required to achieve it - most players will probably put the game away after completing one path. Because Silhouette Mirage is a port of an old Saturn game, it is probably no surprise that the graphics are dated. While the style is appropriately wacky, there\'s very little that\'s impressive about Silhouette Mirage\'s graphics, even if the game ""pushes the 2D capabilities of your PlayStation game console to its limit."" While Silhouette Mirage\'s catchy, upbeat tunes are perfectly suited for the game, the localization team has outdone itself in the annoying-voice department. The game\'s unnecessary rebalancing makes this especially obvious; for example, players will be forced to hear Shyna yell ""BAM!"" every time she hits an enemy up for cash. Those interested in playing Silhouette Mirage should look in their favorite importer\'s bargain bins, as what was once a perfectly fun game is now an unrewarding chore overwrought with tedium. While you won\'t get to see the exclusive Lunar 2 video, you\'ll be treated to a far more competent and enjoyable game experience.

Arcade Party Pack,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Midway is back with yet another collection of old arcade games. This collection provides classics from the mid-\'80s to 1990. On paper, this collection looks unstoppable, but some little control problems and other emulation inaccuracies keep it from reaching its full potential. <P>The game\'s menu interface is simple - you can select a game, watch several video interviews with its developer, and configure most of the game\'s original dip-switch settings. The video interviews are nice and informative, and they provide quite a lot of insight into how arcade games were made back in those days. However, the individual developers aren\'t identified in the video, so there\'s no real way to match the names with the faces. <P>Toobin\' is a two-player game that puts you and a friend in the roles of Bif and Jet, two guys who ride inner tubes and throw soda cans at anything in their way. Your mission is to simply move downstream, avoiding obstacles and collecting treasure chests. You controlled the original arcade game with five buttons. Four were devoted to movement in a very tank-tread type of way, enabling you to make very tight turns, and the fifth was for throwing cans. The default control on the PlayStation lets you play with the D-pad, but it really doesn\'t do the game justice. Thankfully, you can use the top L and R buttons to more accurately reflect the arcade\'s movement controls. Lastly, while the gameplay has remained intact, the sound, specifically the music, is pretty bad. <P>Rampage is another good game gone horribly wrong - and I\'m not talking about the annoying sequels that have been released in recent years. The old monster-smashing-buildings game plays like it\'s skipping two out of every three frames of animation, resulting in an extremely choppy game. Plus, the low screen resolution makes everything look really blurry. <P>""It is the nineties and there is time for... Klax!"" This is quite possibly the silliest game slogan to ever come out of an American developer. This puzzle game, based on catching tiles as they come off a conveyor belt and dropping them into a pit, was released as the Tetris craze was really starting to heat up. Klax is a good enough puzzle game, but it probably won\'t hold your attention in this age of Puyo Puyo and Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo. <P>720 used a custom controller - it was like a paddle controller, only there was a slanted joystick sticking out of it. This let you spin like crazy and pull off all the spinning skateboard tricks in the game. It would seem possible to use the Dual Shock analog stick in the game, and that appears to be what the developers tried to do, but it just doesn\'t work out very well, and you\'re stuck using the digital pad to simply turn left and right at a fixed speed. While the game is still sort of fun, it\'s very difficult to play with these controls, and they all but ruin the game. <P>Super Sprint, Atari\'s 1986 follow-up to the late \'70s black-and-white racing game Sprint, is a three-player driving game with great track design and car upgrades. The arcade version, which sported three steering wheels, demanded that you really get the wheel spinning as fast as possible to make some of the turns without having to slow down. It\'s harder to get that kind of turning radius on the Dual Shock, but the game still controls well enough to make it fun. <P>In my book, Smash TV is the crown jewel in this collection. The spiritual successor to Robotron: 2084, this dual-stick shooter was notoriously hard. The unlimited, free continues in this home version take a little bit of the challenge out of the game, but it\'s still amazingly fun. The translation is reasonably good, runs at full speed, and has excellent control with the digital pad. You can also use the analog sticks to move and shoot, but since your character will only move and fire in eight directions, the analog sticks are slightly more difficult to use. <P>The great conversion of Smash TV alone makes this pack worth picking up. Fans of 720 and Toobin\' will be disappointed by the PlayStation\'s lackluster control, and Rampage fans will simply be disgusted. Hopefully a pack with games like Narc, Total Carnage, and maybe even the original Mortal Kombat won\'t be too far behind. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

WWF Attitude,,"['Product is for Nintendo 64 Platform.Features WWF from 1999.', 'Features WWF from 1999 time frame.']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['More than a simple wrestling game, <i>WWF Attitude</i> puts you in control of the World Wrestling Federation. Over 40 wrestlers are at your command, including The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Undertaker, D-Generation X, and Triple H. Fans of the WWF will recognize all the familiar match formats, everything from one-on-one, two-on-one, or three-on-one, to Royal Rumble, Tag Team, or Stable Match. You can even stage your own ""pay-per-view"" event. And for manager wannabes, there is a fun create-your-own-wrestler feature which lets you build and send your very own seven-foot , 450-pound giant dressed up in a black bikini out onto the mat.', 'Acclaim Sports has done a superb job with the graphics and running commentary, making the game extremely realistic and entertaining. Moreover, up to four people can get in on the action, whether they pair up in a tag team match or duke it out in a winner-take-all king of the ring extravaganza. Devout pro-wrestling fans will not be disappointed. <I>--Hugh Arnold</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Create your own ""pay-per-view"" event or wrestler</li> <li>Cool graphics and commentary</li> <li>Multiplayer option</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Steep learning curve</li> <li>Need a memory card to save newly created ""pay-per-view"" events, wrestlers, and careers</li> </ul>', 'The Nintendo 64 version of WWF War Zone differed a bit from its PlayStation counterpart. The sound wasn\'t nearly as good, but it contained one extra mode that the PlayStation couldn\'t handle. This time around, the games are virtually identical from a features standpoint. And the N64 version has the same music and speech as the PlayStation version. But the improved graphics definitely put this one over the top when you put the two versions side-by-side. Is this year\'s WWF game from Acclaim different enough from last year\'s? In the end, it all depends on how you look at the game. <P>The most obvious improvement to the game is the roster, which has been updated with the times to reflect the ever-changing faces of the World Wrestling Federation. That\'s not to say that the rosters are current, though. Much like War Zone, and well, most other licensed wrestling games, a few wrestlers have changed gimmicks since the game\'s development began. Of course, with development cycles as long as they are these days, you really can\'t fault Acclaim for this one bit. So the Headbangers are still in the game, as is Sable, and Triple H enters the ring to the original D-Generation X music, complete with X-shaped fireworks. <P>Speaking of ring entrances, they\'ve come a long, long way since War Zone. Now you get to see the full ring intro from the game engine\'s perspective, complete with the real, digitized music, from Steve Austin\'s slow swagger to the ring to Ken Shamrock punching himself in the head. Once the wrestlers have all made it to the ring, they\'ll each bust off a little non sequitur before the match starts, like ""DTA! Don\'t trust anyone!"" or Kane mumbling something through his little voice-box thing. It would have been nice to see some end-of-match taunts, similar to the beginning-of-match speech, but instead the winning wrestler stands in the middle of the ring and lamely goes through his taunt animation over and over again. It would have been even nicer to see a few short FMV clips in the game, or at least audio clips of the wrestlers talking trash about each other to various announcers. A rendered announce table at ringside to facilitate a little prematch commentary also would have added another level of depth to the game\'s already thick atmosphere. <P>But enough about all this extra atmosphere stuff. As much as an installment of Raw has very little to do with actual wrestling and more to do with storylines and atmosphere, the game still needs to deliver in the gameplay department. Attitude plays extremely well, but it also plays nearly identically to War Zone. The most significant change to the gameplay is the addition of a more robust set of reversals. In War Zone, most people stayed away from the tie-up position, instead raining on an opponent\'s parade with tons of moves from the ready position. But Attitude\'s got more reversals for moves that come from the ready position, so varied attacks are more important than ever. Regardless of that, however, the game remains largely the same, so those of you who didn\'t like the War Zone rock-paper-scissors-style tie-up system will still be out in the cold. The tie-up system is a great idea, and it keeps you honest by preventing you from doing the same move over and over again, but too frequently you\'ll be trying to do a move from the ready position as your opponent grapples you. You\'ll still be hitting the button for your ready move just as the grapple takes effect, and the result is a match filled with arm bars and other weak moves. Also, even though lots of wrestling games feature tag team or other multiplayer matches, no one seems to have come up with a good way to control all that action. The result in Attitude is a button that cycles though and determines which wrestler you\'re facing for attacks, blocks, and even tags. Since there\'s no easy onscreen indication of which wrestler you\'re actually facing, it\'s very easy to get confused in fast multiplayer matches, resulting in you hopping out of the ring instead of tagging, blocking in the wrong direction, or just kind of spinning around in circles like a moron. <P>There are also a whole lot of modes in the game, most of which are slight variations on the same type of match. You can throw down in standard versus matches, two-on-one fights, three-on-one matches, tornado bouts, and tag team contests, among others. There are also modes based on some of the WWF\'s more famous Pay-Per-View matches, like the Royal Rumble and the Survivor Series. The Rumble pits you against 29 other wrestlers in an over-the-top-rope brawl. In the real thing, a new wrestler hits the ring at a set interval, though here the number of simultaneous wrestlers never gets higher than four. There\'s some occasional slowdown in the Royal Rumble as new wrestlers are loaded on the fly without stopping the action, but it\'s very minor and doesn\'t get in the way of the game at all. Add to that various match conditions, like hard-core matches, I quit matches, or first blood, and you have enough options to keep you creating your own pay-per-views for months. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Armada's music is light orchestral-sounding background music that does a good job of making the game sound epic and spacey.

Trick'n Snowboarder,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Trick N' Snowboarder (Game Only, Playstation, 1999)"", 'Apparently, some Y2K consultant has made a mint by advising video-game companies that the only way to survive the new millennium... is to make a snowboarding game. How else can anyone explain why every game maker (and its respective mother) has flooded the market with variants on this extreme sport? <P>Whether the video-game market needs more snowboarding titles is up for debate. Regardless, Capcom has joined the fray with Trick\'n Snowboarder, an arcade-style speed-and-tricks reflex tester that\'s high on playability - if low on originality. Although pessimists may accuse Capcom of milking the proverbial ""cash cow,"" there\'s no denying that Trick\'n Snowboarder looks flashy, plays smooth, and makes for an engaging - if a bit too easy - alpine experience. <P>The game sticks to the standard recipe for snowboarding titles: wild downhill courses with tons of jump-off points and occasional obstacles; different modes such as alpine, half-pipe, and single-jump competitions; and marginal extras like replay saves and player/title logo-edit functions. <P>The game\'s main strengths are its well-designed tracks and gameplay flexibility - especially for two-player vs. matches. TNS starts with 14 tracks set in locations from Russia to Italy, each well rendered and providing neat little graphical details (the best: a dog chasing after a boarder in the Japan level). The two-player mode augments those tracks with a wealth of options. Notably, you can compete on horizontal or vertical split screens or via link cable. Plus, you can compete for most trick points, race for speed, or do a combination of both. This customization works smoothly and makes for an easy-to-use ""party"" game. <P>For single players, the game has a scenario mode that walks you through a bare-bones storyline with trick requirements for each level. Between levels, secret characters pop up for extra vs. player battles, which spices things up a bit. Beating the scenario mode unlocks additional secret players, which adds marginal playability to the game. <P>From a control standpoint, the game keeps things simple. While the top shift buttons turn the board left or right, three other buttons jump, grab the board, and flip the boarder while in midair. This makes for highly fluid control, making the game very easy to play while giving it an accurate feel. At no point does the gameplay feel mechanical, which is a great plus. <P>In terms of presentation, the game follows a slick MTV-style formula with surprising success. The gist of the gameplay is that the boarders are filming video of awesome tricks. The camera angles come from helicopters capturing your every move. The graphics hold up well under this setup, with the only glitches being occasional polygon dropping in the foreground as boarders whiz past objects (this flaw is a bit more pronounced in the two-player mode). However, it\'s not enough to hamper gameplay, and more importantly, the frame rate never slows down. The well-integrated sound effects, mostly of the boarder on snow and the chatter from the helicopters ahead, add a bit of an adrenaline rush - although the extra noise may annoy some gamers. <P>Despite the praise for its gameplay and graphics, the game has one built-in flaw: Because it\'s so easy to play, it\'s also really simple to beat.  While this doesn\'t detract from the two-player mode, it makes the one-player scenario mode awfully easy to run through in one night. Although there\'s incentive to unlock additional hidden characters - including some of the cast members from Capcom\'s Resident Evil game - by beating this mode repeatedly with higher scores, the storyline remains unchanged, making it less appealing to play over and over again. While some may enjoy replaying these same levels to master new tricks, others might find the one-player experience too shallow to sustain their interest. Altered storylines for different characters would have improved that problem somewhat. Another minor flaw in the scenario mode is that you can\'t decide how to allocate skill points as a boarder improves between levels - the computer chooses. <P>So while Trick\'n Snowboarder may not pack enough original mojo to rise far above other well-known titles in its genre, it plays fast and looks good. Although it might be a bit on the shallow side for one-player action, it\'s great for two-player battles, thanks to a wide selection of courses and fluid gameplay. Overall, this title holds its own against competitors and should suit most casual snowboarding fans fine. --Nelson Taruc <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

But it's also just as likely that you've gotten the chance to take one out for a test drive, found how easily the little machine gets stuck under a desk or behind a doorway, and then, the glamour having faded, moved past the need to own one. That said, Acclaim has created a video-game version of R/C car racing that imitates reality all too well. <P>The cars in Re-Volt vary in three main factors: acceleration, top speed, and weight (front, rear, and 4-wheel drive are also options). Weight is the most important because the lighter the car, the more likely it'll flip over or spin around. So, the heavier the car, the more control you have. The physics are unforgiving, even on the basic setting; on simulation, they're hell. On arcade, they're reasonable, but still tough. <P>The gamut of power-ups gives the game a Mario Kart-like quality, so you'll constantly be diving for a new weapon with which to blast the lead cars. A nice variety of items is available, from oil slicks to homing bottle rockets, electro pulses that cut your opponent's power, and an item that turns your car into a bomb (yes, your antennae becomes a fuse), a fate you can avoid only by smacking into another car. <P>The graphics look sharp in areas close to the car, but in large open tracks, there's an appalling amount of pop-up. Meanwhile, the soundtrack is very solid with an array of clubby techno tunes. Beyond the expected tournament modes, there's also a stunt arena, a track editor, multiplayer races, and a multiplayer battle tag mode (essentially a game of tag). But while the multiplayer race keeps a decent frame rate, and the perspective provides a good view of your surroundings, the computer-controlled racers are missing as competition. Plus, the battle tag is silly, the stunt area is pretty worthless, and the track editor is as basic and clunky as it was in Jeremy McGrath Supercross '99. <P>The poor performance of most of the extras doesn't detract much from the game. The basic game elements do that just fine. There are just too many things to vex you in Re-Volt - from a basic corner turn that forces you to spin out completely to a leap off a curb that causes you to flip over, from sustaining constant enemy fire to getting stuck on a wall at the absolutely worst time. It's a common occurrence for you to get knocked back from first place to last place with the finish line in site. This is a game that will at times tempt you to destroy both your controller and your TV. There are simply too many things that can and do go wrong, either in order or concurrently. Think back to the original Wipeout, where you were slowed to a crawl whenever you touched the wall; magnify that experience by ten, and you have an idea of what Re-Volt is like. It's a shame, because all the elements are in place for a great racing game, but they end up turning against you, instead of setting up the sort of intriguing challenge you'd want. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Scores of evil enemies await Sir Arthur, from zombies to gargoyles, in his quest to save her. Will he survive the perils that await him in the haunted countryside of <i>Ghosts &amp; Goblins</i>?"", ""In 1985, Capcom released a little side scroller called Makai-Mura to Japanese arcades. That game, which soon after appeared in US arcades under the name Ghosts N' Goblins, sticks out in many gamers' minds as one of the first truly great side scrollers. It's also remembered as being unbelievably difficult to complete. The game was translated to the NES, and now it's come to the Game Boy Color. The translation to the Game Boy Color stays very true to the original's gameplay while adding a password function to allow for multisession gaming. The story is as old as time itself. You, as Arthur the knight, are kicking it in the graveyard with your best girl. Satan, big meanie that he is, simply can't have this, so a winged demon swoops down, kidnaps your lady friend, and vanishes. What's a knight to do? Get into his armor and start running to the right, of course! You'll make your way from the graveyard through lava-filled levels and caves and eventually to the castle where your fair maiden is being kept. Arthur's attacks are weapon based. You'll start out throwing lances, but as you progress you'll change to weapons such as a sword, an axe, or everyone's least favorite weapon, the torch. Taking one hit from an enemy will blow you out of your armor; taking another will kill you. Graphically, the game puts on a pretty good show, mimicking the NES version's graphics more than the arcade version. The soundtrack is faithful to the original version in melody, but the music and sound effects sound a bit like they're being piped through the Commodore 64's SID chip. Overall, the sound is very good. Portable-console players looking for a side scroller won't be disappointed with Ghosts N' Goblins.

As such, NBA Showtime, the company's latest arcade basketball game, is coming to the Dreamcast, the Nintendo 64, the PlayStation, and, yes, the Game Boy. The PlayStation version manages to feature most of the options and gameplay of the arcade version, but the sound and graphics have taken a rather large hit. NBA Showtime is essentially the latest iteration of the arcade basketball classic, NBA Jam. The most obvious upgrade from Jam to Showtime is graphical. The game is now in full 3D, as opposed to NBA Jam's 2D looks. The arcade version of Showtime featured extremely nice player models. The player heads looked outstanding. While the arcade version had players that looked real (to the point of being downright frightening at times), the PlayStation just can't push the required number of polygons to deliver that arcade look. As such, the characters look blocky, the crowd doesn't move, the ball leaves an ugly motion trail. But graphical tweaks have been made so that the game runs at a playable speed. Unlike Jam, Showtime actually calls fouls. After one human player (computer players are allowed to be as nasty as they want to be) commits five fouls in one quarter, a player from the opposing team is sent to the line for a free throw, worth three points. Now, at first, the concept of fouls in a no-rules arcade basketball game may seem like a horrible idea, but it actually balances the game out fairly well and keeps it from degenerating into huge shove fests. The game features a lot of speech, including the calling out of every player name. The gameplay is vintage NBA Jam. It's two-on-two basketball at its finest, complete with huge dunks, alley-oops, shoves, swats, and lots and lots of goaltending. The ball never goes out of bounds, and aside from goaltending and the occasional foul call, the only other rule is the shot clock. You've got a turbo button, a pass/steal button, and a shoot/jump button at your disposal. You'll control the same player throughout the game, so if you don't have a human teammate, you'll have to issue commands to your teammate when he's carrying the ball. You can call for a pass or command the computer player to shoot the ball. Double tapping turbo executes a quick evasive spin or dodge move that you can use to get past pesky defenders. The game features a create-a-player mode, which lets you pick a head for your player, as well as customize several stats, such as height, weight, dunking ability, and power. You can pick a jersey number and what name the announcer will call you by. As you win games with a created player, you'll earn new points to distribute in the various stat categories. Aside from the aforementioned gameplay bugs, the game controls reasonably well. You use the analog controller to simulate the arcade game's 49-way joysticks. Because the player models look a little funky, it's occasionally hard to tell which way you're pointed when all four players crowd together. This makes accurate shoves and steals tough. It's not perfect, but NBA Showtime is still a fun four-player game, and it's worlds better than any other arcade basketball game on the PlayStation. Give it a three-day rental and see if you're left hungry for more.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

As such, NBA Showtime, the company's latest arcade basketball game, is coming to the Dreamcast, the Nintendo 64, the PlayStation, and, yes, the Game Boy. The Nintendo 64 version manages to feature most of the options and gameplay of the arcade version, but the sound and graphics have taken a rather large hit. NBA Showtime is essentially the latest iteration of the arcade basketball classic, NBA Jam. The most obvious upgrade from Jam to Showtime is graphical. The game is now in full 3D, as opposed to NBA Jam's 2D looks. The arcade version of Showtime featured extremely nice player models. The player heads looked outstanding. While the arcade version had players that looked real (to the point of being downright frightening at times), the N64 just can't push the required number of polygons to deliver that arcade look. As such, the characters look blocky, the crowd doesn't move, the ball leaves an ugly motion trail, and other graphical tweaks have been made. These tweaks allow the game to run at a playable speed, but some playability issues have been introduced that don't quite match up with the arcade version. Some of the dunks are missing frames of animation, causing players to suddenly teleport from about two feet away from the rim and sink the ball. Needless to say, this makes blocking dunks - an exercise in timing and skill - much more difficult. Also, three-pointers seem slightly easier to sink when you have opposing players in your face - a phenomenon that is exactly opposite from the arcade version. Unlike Jam, Showtime actually calls fouls. After one human player (computer players are allowed to be as nasty as they want to be) commits five fouls in one quarter, a player from the opposing team is sent to the line for a free throw, worth three points. Now, at first, the concept of fouls in a no-rules arcade basketball game may seem like a horrible idea, but it actually balances the game out fairly well and keeps it from degenerating into huge shove fests. The arcade version of the game featured a lot of speech, including the calling out of every player name. This is gone from the N64 version, but a good deal of phrases from both the announcer and the players remain. The gameplay is vintage NBA Jam. It's two-on-two basketball at its finest, complete with huge dunks, alley-oops, shoves, swats, and lots and lots of goaltending. The ball never goes out of bounds, and aside from goaltending and the occasional foul call, the only other rule is the shot clock. You've got a turbo button, a pass/steal button, and a shoot/jump button at your disposal. You'll control the same player throughout the game, so if you don't have a human teammate, you'll have to issue commands to your teammate when he's carrying the ball. You can call for a pass or command the computer player to shoot the ball. Double tapping turbo executes a quick evasive spin or dodge move that you can use to get past pesky defenders. The game features a create-a-player mode, which lets you pick a head for your player as well as customize several stats, such as height, weight, dunking ability, and power. You can pick a jersey number and the name the announcer would call you, but since you can't see the jersey numbers on any of the players, and the player name speech isn't in the N64 version, having these options just seems silly. As you win games with a created player, you'll earn new points you can use in the various stat categories. Aside from the aforementioned gameplay bugs, the game controls reasonably well. You use the analog stick to simulate the arcade game's 49-way joysticks. Because the player models look a little funky, it's occasionally hard to tell which way you're pointed when all four players crowd together. This makes accurate shoves and steals tough. It's not perfect, but NBA Showtime is still a fun four-player game, and it's worlds better than the team's last N64 arcade basketball translation, NBA Hangtime. Give it a three-day rental, and see if you're left hungry for more.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Re-Volt,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['It sounds like a great idea: take the common childhood activity of playing with radio-controlled cars, and make a video game out of it. Yes, the oddly titled <i>Re-Volt</i> is an RC car racing simulation. Buying a video game rather than the real thing eliminates the hassles of worn-out batteries, broken antennas, and damaged furniture, and <i>Re-Volt</i> adds the excitement of racing cars around diverse locales such as empty toy stores, gardens, and the deck of a ship. To spice things up, the <I>Re-Volt</I> creators planted various power-ups around the tracks so the cars can have weapons, such as guided bottle rockets, water balloons, and oil slicks.', ""Yes, it does sound like fun. So why isn't it? After the novelty wears off, it all comes down to gameplay. The creators have reproduced the physics of driving cheap RC cars very accurately. Too accurately, in fact. All of the things that are annoying about RC cars in real life are also annoying in this game: the lack of variable steering, the way your car stops dead when it just brushes against a wall, the wide turning radius, and the slow speeds all combine for a singularly frustrating experience."", ""Most racing simulation games succeed when they reproduce the thrill of racing a real car. Unfortunately for Acclaim, reproducing the thrill of racing a 4-inch-high plastic toy running on AA batteries just isn't as much fun as it should be. <i>--Eric Fredrickson</i>"", ""<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Fun race track settings</li> <li>Indestructible cars</li> <li>Up to 4 players can play</li> <li>No batteries required!</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Mercilessly accurate physics</li> <li>Can't save after each race, only after each championship circuit (3-4 races)</li> <li>Built-in track editor is very limited and difficult to use</li> </ul>"", ""Chances are you've wanted a remote-control car at some point in your life. But it's also just as likely that you've gotten the chance to take one out for a test drive, found how easily the little machine gets stuck under a desk or behind a doorway, and then, the glamour having faded, moved past the need to own one. That said, Acclaim has created a video-game version of R/C car racing that imitates reality all too well. <P>The cars in Re-Volt vary in three main factors: acceleration, top speed, and weight (front, rear, and 4-wheel drive are also options). Weight is the most important because the lighter the car, the more likely it'll flip over or spin around. So, the heavier the car, the more control you have. The physics are unforgiving, even on the basic setting; on simulation, they're hell. On arcade, they're reasonable, but still tough. <P>The gamut of power-ups gives the game a Mario Kart-like quality, so you'll constantly be diving for a new weapon with which to blast the lead cars. A nice variety of items is available, from oil slicks to homing bottle rockets, electro pulses that cut your opponent's power, and an item that turns your car into a bomb (yes, your antennae becomes a fuse), a fate you can avoid only by smacking into another car. <P>The graphics are fairly sharp with a RAM Pak in place, and its techno soundtrack is surprisingly solid for the cartridge format. Beyond the expected tournament modes, there's also a stunt arena, a track editor, multiplayer races, and a multiplayer battle tag mode (essentially a game of tag). The multiplayer race keeps a fast frame rate, the perspective provides a good view of your surroundings, and you have computer-controlled racers as competition; unfortunately, the battle tag is silly, the stunt area is pretty worthless, and the track editor is as basic and clunky as it was in Jeremy McGrath Supercross '99. <P>The poor performance of most of the extras doesn't detract much from the game. The basic game elements do that just fine. There are just too many things to vex you in Re-Volt - from a basic corner turn that forces you to spin out completely to a leap off a curb that causes you to flip over, from sustaining constant enemy fire to getting stuck on a wall at the absolutely worst time. It's a common occurrence for you to get knocked back from first place to last place with the finish line in site. This is a game that will at times tempt you to destroy both your controller and your TV. There are simply too many things that can and do go wrong, either in order or concurrently. Think back to the original Wipeout, where you were slowed to a crawl whenever you touched the wall; magnify that experience by ten, and you have an idea of what Re-Volt is like. It's a shame, because all the elements are in place for a great racing game, but they end up turning against you, instead of setting up the sort of intriguing challenge you'd want. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Paperboy,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"[""Back in the early '80s, Midway rolled out the destined-to-be-a-classic arcade game <i>Paper Boy</i>, in which bike-riding players delivered newspapers to subscribers while avoiding numerous pitfalls and obstacles. Ports to home gaming systems through the years kept the kid's career active, and now <i>Paper Boy</i> is promoted to the Nintendo 64 platform in a familiar, yet entirely unique, 3-D action adventure."", ""As in the original version, Paper Boy must deliver the daily news to subscribers' homes, landing each toss perfectly to avoid canceled subscriptions. To add to the kid's stress, his or her paper route traverses more than two dozen hazard-laden neighborhoods, from the classic suburban sprawl to arid desert communities to deep forest dwellings. Along the way, the player rides into a mess of dangers: in addition to crazed animals and inattentive drivers, the end of the century brings such prophetic hazards as spewing volcanoes and invading aliens."", ""No longer stuck on a straight path, players explore the 3-D world with full freedom of movement. In addition, Paper Boy now performs all sorts of tricks--bunny hops, flips, spins--that help him or her along the way. Keep on rollin', old buddy. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", ""Like many classic arcade games that have been redesigned and rereleased on a current console, Paper Boy has traded in its handlebars in favor of an N64 controller. While the premise is still the same - deliver papers to doorsteps and mailboxes while avoiding cars, dogs, burglars, and other oddities - now, the young newspaper-distribution engineer gets to roam about in a fully 3D environment. But while Paper Boy 64 tries its best to stay close to its arcade roots, it strays too far from the tried-and-true Paper Boy formula and doesn't really deliver the classic arcade experience. The biggest and most noticeable difference between the two games is the new environment in Paper Boy 64. The isometric 2D world has been replaced with a fully 3D environment. So, instead of only delivering papers to the left side of the street, the new paperboy gets to handle both sides of the road, alleyways, and even a boardwalk or two. Best of all, you have total freedom to roam about - meaning you can make your own routes to the houses you deliver to. So, if you miss a house, you can now turn around and give it another shot. And instead of poor aim being your principal enemy, a time limit in each level and a health meter are the only things that will slow you down. The new Paper Boy shows more of a level structure, instead of the single street you were up against in the original. This new level system also includes bosses. If you've delivered enough papers to enough houses, you'll unlock a boss level, and once you have defeated the boss, you can move along into different areas of the game. Another new addition to the game is a power-up system - now you can collect extra time, health, booster packs, and other items to help you along your way. Everything in the new Paper Boy has an oversimplified polygonal look to it. Houses, trailers, dogs, and even the paperboy himself look as though they were designed and rendered on an ancient Amiga. Other nice graphical additions are the different themes of the courses themselves. Instead of just traveling through typical suburban neighborhoods the whole game, you'll bounce around to seaside communities, trailer parks, and camping grounds, just to name a few. Each level has its own vehicles, pedestrians, houses, and obstacles. You'll run into roller-skating goat demons in the mad-scientist level, angry pelicans in the seaside level, and runaway moose in the camping level. This definitely adds some needed variety to the Paper Boy formula. The sounds are pretty lame. The main theme that runs over the game's soundtrack is an updated version of the classic Paper Boy tune. Perhaps in an attempt to seem tied to the original, all the sound effects and speech sound really dated. Unfortunately, this doesn't help the retro-game effect the game may have been trying to achieve - instead, it just ends up sounding poor. Because you're in a completely new environment, a completely new control scheme had to be devised. Instead of just tapping a button to toss a paper to your left, you'll now have both a left and right paper-tossing button. You can also hold down the paper-toss button and steer your throws with a helpful onscreen arrow. The new Paper Boy also has buttons that control speed, so you don't have to rely on the control stick itself to do the job. And one of the most surprising control elements is the new jump button, which lets you simply hop over obstacles. The control system is pretty rudimentary, and it lets you take command of the Paperboy without any major learning process. While a decent game on its own, Paper Boy 64 doesn't capture the magic of the original arcade game. People looking to relive the magic of Paper Boy would be better off playing the ported version, available to PlayStation owners on the Midway Presents Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 2 disc, or - better yet - by tracking down an arcade cabinet - handlebars and all.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

You control the players effortlessly, and the running game in particular benefits from your having the ability to hit a hole between two offensive lineman. The players also hold their blocks well, allowing for realistic runs.', ""Unlike many previous Madden games, the passing game in Madden 2000 takes some getting used to. The challenge, which takes several games to learn, is to look either for a receiver who has separated himself from his covering defender or for a receiver who's wide open, before throwing the ball. Forcing a ball into tight coverage will result in an incompletion at best and an interception at worst."", ""The practice mode helps you to understand this, as well as the running game and the need to accelerate into the holes as soon as they appear. All offensive and defensive formations are available in the practice mode, and figuring out which offenses work, and more importantly don't work, against certain defenses is important for beating the computer AI at the harder levels of difficulty."", ""Madden 2000's graphics are generally excellent, and the overall presentation is top quality. But the little touches are just superb. It is natural for you to make the quarterback backpedal prior to a passing attempt. But in reality, a quarterback who throws while backpedaling will throw off his back foot and have less zip on the ball. This is the case in Madden 2000, where the quarterback must stop if he's going to make a good pass. You'll notice other details, like how a running back fights for extra yardage while in the grasp of a would-be tackler, or how his helmet pops off after a strong tackle. If judged solely on its gameplay, Madden 2000 would be an undisputed winner."", 'However, everything that is good about the gameplay is almost overshadowed by an incredibly frustrating navigational interface. It would be difficult to come up with an interface this bad if you were trying. Its clunky counterintuitive keyboard layout alternately stymies and frustrates any attempts to reasonably move around this game.', ""That's a shame, because Madden 2000 has some great ideas, like a fantasy draft, full general manager control, a play editor, and customizable playbooks - and yet it's hard to imagine anyone using any of it for more than ten minutes without cursing and going back to season mode. Some years ago, Sierra's Front Page Sports Football set the standard for play editors and general manager functions, and EA should have caught up by now."", ""Regardless of its interface, the Madden series is known both as a great game and also as an attempt to simulate real football wherever possible. Games such as NFL Blitz opt for arcade-style gameplay instead, and for some reason EA felt the need to compete and add an arcade mode to Madden 2000. But that's not what Madden does best, and an arcade-style game with illegal procedure called for kicking the ball out of bounds isn't much fun. EA would have been better off sticking with what it knows."", ""In other ways, Madden 2000 feels a little rushed, as if it had to get out for the start of the football season. You'll sense this primarily in the commentary. While Pat Summerall is usually very relevant and informative, some of Madden's comments are just plain silly and inappropriate. Maybe the commentary isn't a big deal, but it seems strange in a game that is otherwise first-rate."", ""Madden 2000 also features a mode that includes ten scenarios from history's great games, which you must complete in order. This reward-for-success system is fine in this context but is taken to an extreme by introducing the concept of the Madden Challenge, in which you must earn points in order to unlock secret teams and more. This would be understandable in some other genre but doesn't make a whole lot of sense in a sports game."", ""Madden 2000 is both awesome and frustrating. It's a good football game, but it's only a so-so product. Completely overhauling the interface while leaving the gameplay intact would result in possibly the greatest football game ever. <i>--Colin Sloan</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Flag to Flag Cart Racing,,"['Brand New', 'Sealed']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"['Sega\'s <i>Flag to Flag CART Racing</i> brings the world\'s fastest  closed-circuit auto racing to Sega Dreamcast. Fully licensed by CART and  designed with the help of CART\'s champion ""Team Rahal,""  Sega has created an  accurate and realistic racing game for console gaming. Hold on tight as you race  through 19 real-life tracks including superspeed ovals, street, and road  courses. Choose from 27 official CART drivers from 17 different teams with  authentic stats. The graphics engine creates exact replicas of both cars and  courses down to the sponsor decals. Watch out for the variable weather and  lighting. With multiple gameplay modes (from Arcade to Simulation), you\'ll be  ready to burn rubber.', 'A surprising release in Japan shortly after the Dreamcast launch (considering C.A.R.T. racing is much more popular in America), Sega\'s CART Flag to Flag attempts to deliver the hands-on thrills of the sport in 128-bit power. While it\'s a quality effort, some glaring shortcomings and an overall lack of ""oomph"" relegate this game to ""could\'ve been better"" status. Let us dissect. <P>Developed by Zoom - those wacky guys responsible for the Zero Divide series and the obscure import fighter Rurouni Kenshin - Flag to Flag is more of a filler title for the Dreamcast\'s American launch than anything else. This becomes even more obvious with games like Scud Racer and Daytona 2 brewing on the horizon. As far as value is concerned, Flag to Flag certainly fulfills its responsibilities by providing 19 tracks to race on (Gold Coast, Laguna Seca, Rio De Janeiro, Gateway International, etc.), all the professional teams you could want to play as (Al Unser Jr.\'s team, Bobby Rahal\'s, and so on), and arcade and championship modes. <P>Arcade mode obviously brings a simple ""slam the gas and pass"" mentality to the game, while championship mode offers a more in-depth approach to C.A.R.T. racing. In championship mode, you can use a practice round to familiarize yourself with the upcoming track, tweak your car settings, participate in a qualifying session, and finally enter the race itself. <P>Car settings let you manipulate things like tire compounds, aerodynamics, fuel, suspension, gear ratio, and the transmission. Other options include weather settings, race length, car damage, corner signs, and full-course caution signs. Otherwise, everything here is basically straightforward. <P>This is, after all, a racing game.CART Flag to Flag\'s visuals are of consistently high quality, with two attractive ""in-cockpit"" perspectives to really give you the feeling of having your butt eight inches over the tarmac. In fact, one of those views even causes the ""driver"" to wipe the dirt from his visor on occasion. Track elements like dirt or sand will appear on your tires should you hit a shoulder or trackside, and the side-mounted rearview mirrors offer realistic reflections of the racers behind you. Unfortunately, of the 19 available tracks, none seems particularly different from each other, and everything seems to have a hazy, overcast feel to it. Some dramatic light sourcing could have helped matters, but everything seems a bit pale in general. The game runs at a smooth 30fps, which isn\'t bad considering the far line of sight you get with little draw-in and the large number of racers on track. The sounds seem to have been recorded from actual vehicles to enhance authenticity. Each car gives off a different rumble, and they all have a different feel when you are driving them. <P>The game is also compatible with Sega\'s racing wheel accessory, so armchair racers can really get into it. The problem, however, is the intrinsic nature of CART racing itself, which is mainly to drive around a large oval. Sure, tracks like Laguna Seca and Cleveland offer nasty corners and twists, but more often than not, it\'s big ovals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Set the game to a high number of laps and you may dive off the track in your sleep. If it weren\'t for the convincing sense of speed and the great in-cockpit view, this game might just be one of the blandest racing ""experiences"" of the generation. The Dreamcast equivalent of Sega\'s F1 Challenge for the Saturn, Flag to Flag fulfills all its obligations, yet never really goes beyond them. Aimed mainly at the C.A.R.T. fan, other Dreamcast owners waiting for a great racer would be better advised to look into Sega Rally 2. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Army Men Air Attack,,['Mission based shooting game'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Includes game only, NO CASE OR INSTRUCTIONS!!  Fast Shipping!!', '3DO has been milking the whole concept of little plastic army men as real-life soldiers for quite some time now. The PC has seen a couple of Army Men strategy games, while the console systems have received some weak games, such as Army Men 3D and Army Men: Sarge\'s Heroes. But you shouldn\'t give up on the Army Men series just yet. Army Men: Air Attack is a mission-based helicopter shooter that actually makes the little green guys fun to play with again. <P>Remember the Strike series, Electronic Arts\' line of mission-based helicopter shooters? Remember how bad the last few Strike games were? Air Attack plays a bit like the old, good Strike games. You, as a helicopter pilot for the Green army, embark on several missions in an attempt to defeat the insidious Tan army, led by General Plastro. Some levels take place in the plastic world, while some take place in the real world. Certain items act differently in each world. For instance, a lifeless real-world teddy bear becomes a valuable attack bear when brought through the portal and into the plastic world. The mission design is varied, with a heavy emphasis on ""wipe out every enemy in sight"" levels. Other missions will have you guarding trains, freeing colonies of bugs, and defending your base from an ant invasion. You\'ll have some pretty standard weaponry on your chopper, including machine guns, missiles, homing rockets, and napalm. But you can also use various objects in the environment as weapons. Don\'t like the looks of the well-defended Tan base up ahead? Pick up an apple, or perhaps a pinecone, and drop it on the enemy defenses. As you progress through the game, you\'ll earn new helicopters, each of which is rated in armor, mobility, weaponry, and winch speed. Your copilot selection also has an effect the accuracy of your guns, missiles, and winch. Each copilot has a ""personality,"" which manifests in three or four different one-liners. <P>Army Men: Air Attack makes good use of the analog controller. The left stick controls speed and heading. The right stick can be used to strafe left and right, but the L1 and R1 buttons accomplish this just as well. By combining turning and strafing, you can effectively circle-strafe around your enemies, making short work of them before most of them can even draw a bead on you. The winch works great, and items are easy to grab and drop, unlike in the later games in the Strike series, where you must have pinpoint accuracy. <P>With the exception of your copilot\'s chatter, which gets a little grating after a few levels, the sound effects are well done. Nothing too special or realistic-sounding. Little touches - like the bugs shouting, ""We\'re free!"" (in voices reminiscent of the little man insect at the end of The Fly) when liberated from their roach motel prisons - give the game a little more flair. The graphics are about as good as you can expect from a game based on a collection of green and tan plastic toys. Each unit has a bit of plastic shine. The terrain looks like grass, dirt, and mud without looking too blocky. <P>The main flaw of Air Attack is a general lack of difficulty. There are really only two or three missions that pose a real challenge; the rest of them are cakewalks once you\'ve gotten the control down well enough to dodge bullets. But even though you\'ll be able to skate through most of the game, there are a couple multiplayer modes that keep the game interesting. Cooperative mode lets you go through the main game with a friend. Flag Nab-It is a game of capture the flag, where you must infiltrate your opponent\'s base, steal his flag, and take it to your base to score. <P>While it may not completely wash away the bad taste left by Army Men 3D and Army Men: Sarge\'s Heroes, Army Men: Air Attack is a fun little mission-based shooter that is worth checking out. The ease of the game makes it a good rental, but the multiplayer is good enough to warrant purchasing the game. Fans of the 16-bit Strike games will be pleasantly surprised, also. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

"Star Trek: The Next Generation, Birth of the Federation",,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<I>Star Trek: The Next Generation, Birth of the Federation</I> is the first PC CD-ROM strategy game based on the rich <I>Star Trek,</I> universe! Forged from the cultures, time lines, events, and technologies of the hit TV show <I>Star Trek: The Next Generation,</I> this turn-based epic emphasizes resource management, combat, and diplomacy. Control one of five major alliances: Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Ferengi, or Cardassian, each with its own set of abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Encounter over 30 exotic races. And beware, there lurks the potential for a Borg invasion--threatening <I>all</I> players!', ""Anyone who has played Master of Orion will find Birth of the Federation very familiar. It is not so much that the game is an unofficial sequel to that classic space strategy game, but more that both games borrow so many features from Civilization. In many ways, Birth of the Federation is the next in the long line of MicroProse strategy games, breaking little from the mold set by Civilization and cemented by Master of Orion and Master of Magic. While each had its own distinct flavor, all these games shared many qualities. Birth of the Federation is no different. <P> The options in the game are as robust as any other MicroProse strategy title. You can vary your starting conditions in the game setup menu, but in general, you get a barely developed starting solar system and an imperative to conquer the rest of the galaxy. The options you can adjust include the starting technology level of the five major empires (Federation, Cardassian, Ferengi, Klingon, and Romulan), the number of minor races in the game (such as Vulcans, Nausicaans, and Betazoids), the shape of the galaxy, and the size of the galaxy. The shape dictates how you can travel in the galaxy, while the size determines how much territory you need to conquer and when you'll encounter your rivals. <P> Once in the game, you have to manage and guide your empire through technological research, diplomatic relations, espionage, military buildup, internal production, exploration, and outright ship-to-ship combat. The game starts off simply, as do all these games, but can get very complex and overwhelming. Those who don't have patience for the micromanagement might call the exponentially complex gameplay tedious, and indeed, each extra system to manage does add more repetitive action, but those who enjoy this kind of game won't be disappointed. <P> I did appreciate that the different races do act according to their Star Trek personae. The Klingons come off as aggressive warmongers, and the Ferengi sure sound like sneaky bastards. The Federation, predictably, was always last to declare war on me and always seemed to make quick friends with most of the minor races. As far as accurately representing the Star Trek universe, Birth of the Federation does a good job. <P> Unfortunately, the interface leaves much to be desired. It is a jumble of colors and icons, ensuring that beginners will spend a lot of time fumbling over buttons until they arrive at the desired action. For example, the descriptions of the troop transport don't tell you that the only way to build an outpost or starbase is by transforming an existing transport. You have to dig through the manual or stumble along until you figure that out. While there is a tutorial of sorts in the form of saved games, there really should have been an obvious tutorial with better help as one of the main menu options. <P> In addition, there should have been better documentation of each race's special buildings and concrete stats on their specific strengths. After all, this is a strategy game. It's already crammed with stats. There is no reason not to include stats in the manual if they let you know why you want to play a certain race. As it is, the manual says the Romulans have good intelligence, but it says the same for the Cardassians. Which is better? <P> Moreover, the futuristic setting is at a disadvantage as far as easing gamers into the game's complexity. Whereas Civilization has the benefit of using historical terms and units to define its gameplay, Birth of the Federation falls into the same trap as Firaxis Games' Alpha Centauri: It's not easy to tell the difference between futuristic technologies. <P> One other thing that bothered me were the voice-overs during combat. I wish there were a way to shut them off without turning voice off altogether. Otherwise, tactical combat is fine. It doesn't look too bad, although when you get large ships engaging small ones, it gets hard to spot the small vessels. At least you can zoom in and out and rotate at will. <P> While games of this nature tend to have very drawn-out endgames, Birth of the Federation addresses this problem to an extent by counting 60 percent conquest of the galaxy as victory. This is a great feature because having to crush every last vestige of the enemy's territory when you've already essentially won can get tedious. However, while this partial conquest victory condition is nice, it doesn't always prevent games from dragging out if you are on the losing end (in one game, it took 60 turns for the combined races of the galaxy to crush me, even though I had no ships and only one system). <P> Birth of the Federation is a good game, if you are willing to forgive the interface and the amount of micromanagement required. It definitely has a Star Trek feel to it, right down to the humanoid aliens and confusing technobabble. As for gameplay, it doesn't stray too far from the Master of Orion mold, making it a good, albeit familiar, game. <i>--Elliott Chin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

The two Star Trek guns are the disruptor pistol and rifle, which have the saving grace of a nice disintegration effect, and the other two weapons are a knife and the Bat\'Leth (that curved Klingon battle sword). Then we have the spinning disk from Unreal, the rocket launcher (with an additional twist of heat-seeking rockets), the grenade launcher, and a rail gun (called ""Sith Har"" here). The ubergun, the particle dispersal cannon, is really nice because it either fires a massive energy wave or creates a miniature black hole.', 'And while MicroProse made a lot of tweaks to the engine, the multiplayer is still hampered by the limitations that have plagued Unreal. MicroProse is promising to work with Epic on the infamous multiplayer patch, but for now, consider Klingon Honor Guard to be a single-player game.', ""Klingon Honor Guard is a decent action game utilizing the Star Trek franchise. It's fun to wield that famed Bat'Leth - the Klingon-style one-liners your character dishes out are amusing. If you're a Star Trek fan, you'll probably appreciate the levels and enemies. But judged on its merits as a shooter, Klingon Honor Guard suffers because of its average design. <i>--Thierry Nguyen</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

NFL Blitz 2000,,['PS1 game'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['NFL BLITZ 2000 is the updated version of the popular NFL BLITZ. All of the arcade-style football action has returned, including seven-on-seven play, bone-crunching hits, big plays, and no referees. However, there have been several gameplay improvements. There are more plays to choose from this year, but if none of them are acceptable, create your own with the Play Editor. And, changing plays at the line of scrimmage is a breeze with the new audible system. Wisely using audibles and playing well will result in your team being ""on fire,"" giving your players boosted abilities. Try these new abilities out on three of your friends in the Tournament mode, or challenge all of the teams in the league in the Arcade mode. If your goal is to win the Super Bowl, guide your team to victory in the Season mode. NFL BLITZ 2000 has action so intense; your mama will feel it.', ""When NFL Blitz came out for the PlayStation a little under a year ago, the game's sequel, NFL Blitz '99, was very close to hitting arcades. This resulted in a bit of a bind: Stay home and play the still-great two-player game or venture into arcades seeking four-player gaming, new plays, and all the other little tweaks and fixes that the second release brought? Now, a year later, Midway is finally bringing the Blitz series up to speed on the consoles. But NFL Blitz 2000 is far more than a mere port of Blitz '99."", ""For starters, the play editor that had been exclusive to the Nintendo 64 version of Blitz and the arcade version of Blitz '99 has come to the PlayStation, and it has been expanded. Now, instead of just being able to create a page of offensive plays, you can create defensive formations, as well. You can also make new fake punts and fake field-goal formations. The playbook section is also where you'll set your audibles, which let you change plays on the fly if you see an unfavorable setup on the other side of the field. Finally, you can edit your playbook's three pages of offensive plays and one page of defensive plays, picking from a wide variety of brand-new plays, as well as from all the old favorites from Blitz and Blitz '99."", 'The gameplay has also been changed a bit. Most of these changes just bring the gameplay up to date with Blitz \'99, but there have also been a couple of things added here. The most drastic change is the addition of four-player support. In the four-player game, one player controls the quarterback, his teammate takes on the role of receiver, and the other two players can play any defensive player they choose. The push move, which made you stand still in the original Blitz, has been changed to an on-the-fly push, which makes it a much more useful move, since you can use it and still keep running. The deep strategy that the two-player game had contained has been traded for faster four-player action in the form of push battles, where the human-controlled receiver tries to push down all his opposition to get open, while the opposing team tries to keep the receiver on the ground with the very same push move. Of course, the two-player option is still intact, as is the ability to play one- and three-player games. Three-player games can be tough, since having to deal with two human defenders is a real challenge. The ""on fire"" feature that was made popular in NBA Jam and which entered the Blitz series in \'99 remains in 2000. Much like Jam, being on fire in Blitz gives you infinite turbo and makes you much harder to stop. Unlike Blitz \'99, if you\'re on fire and you throw an interception, the fire goes out immediately after the interception, instead of waiting until the end of the play. New to 2000 is the kick meter, which gives you both distance and directional control over all your kicks. Extra point kicks are still handled with just a button press. In an attempt to appease players that are more accustomed to more conventional football games, an icon-based passing system has been included in the game, but it\'s totally optional. Personally, I feel it\'s poorly implemented, since while you\'re using the icon-based system, spinning and jumping to evade sacks are a bit more difficult. The game\'s rosters are also up-to-date.', ""The original PlayStation Blitz looked good for a PlayStation game, and Blitz 2000 holds true to that standard, making some pretty substantial improvements. The palette is much better this time around, resulting in more-colorful players and fields. Also, the game moves a bit quicker and much more smoothly. The sound has also been fixed up a bit. The commentary is timelier, and several phrases have been added to the announcer's vocabulary."", ""People who haven't seen Blitz '99 in arcades yet are going to be blown away by the additions and tweaks that have been made since the original Blitz was released on the PlayStation. Veterans of Blitz '99 will welcome the ability to finally play the updated game at home, and the new Y2K add-ons don't hurt, either. NFL Blitz 2000 still has a firm lock on the arcade football business. --Jeff Gerstmann <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Star Wars: X-Wing VS TIE Fighter with Balance of Power - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Fly over 50 combat missions in 9 meticulously enhanced Star Wars starfighters with or against your friends. Engage in melees taking on all rivals to determine once and for all who the greatest starfighter pilot in the galaxy is. Single or multi-player - mew missions let you fly for the Empire or the Rebellion, alone or with others, cooperatively or competitively. Includes authentic film score, realistic sound effects and full motin cinematic framing sequences.', 'Very few gamers were entirely satisfied with X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter when it was originally released last summer. In fact, to many gamers, it was both one of the most eagerly anticipated and ultimately one of the most disappointing games of 1997. Critics noted the lack of support for 3D accelerator cards; the omission of several of the more powerful fighters from past games in the series, such as the B-Wing and TIE Defender; the cartoonish cockpit graphics; and the visually disproportionate size of the apparently puny Imperial Star Destroyers. But the most frequently expressed complaint of disgruntled purchasers was that Totally Games and LucasArts, by concentrating almost exclusively on providing a multiplayer dogfighting arena, had abandoned the storyline-driven gameplay of previous games in the series. X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter provided no storyline, no campaigns, no dramatic cutscenes, and overall, a poor single-player experience. Fortunately, Balance of Power does an admirable job of addressing almost all the complaints gamers had with the original game. <P> Balance of Power includes two separate 15-mission campaigns - one for the Imperial forces and one for the Rebel forces. In the Rebel missions you\'ll be on the defensive from the outset, scrambling to regroup your forces in order to fend off, and ultimately destroy, a large Imperial fleet equipped with a gigantic Super Star Destroyer. Ye of little faith who thought LucasArts could never properly depict the size of a massive ship like the Super Star Destroyer will be suitably humbled the first time you lay your eyes on this beast. Although an epic ""attack the Death Star"" mission is still missing, challenging the city-sized Super Star Destroyer provides an apt substitute. The Imperial campaign involves chasing down the Rebels and preventing them from establishing a new Starship Shipyard. Every time you manage to complete five missions in a campaign, you are rewarded with a well-produced cutscene (six in total) that advances the campaign storyline in a compelling manner (and in the largely nameless/faceless X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter universe, which usually means a computer-generated sequence with a lot of ships blowing up). Best of all, the campaigns can be played through by a group of players as cooperative multiplayer missions. After you complete a campaign mission, you can replay it as a training mission. <P> The missions in the campaigns are refreshingly varied in their objectives and design and are, paradoxically, both the best addition to X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter and the cause of the most frustration. A number of the campaign missions are extremely difficult for a single player to successfully complete on the default difficulty level. Since tasks (which are occasionally unintuitive) often have to be carried out in a particular sequence, too many of the missions end up feeling puzzle-like, requiring you to figure out exactly where you have to go at different stages of the mission in order to be successful. Anyone familiar with Lawrence Holland\'s other games, Like X-Wing, Tie Fighter, and Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe won\'t be surprised by the occasionally devilishly challenging mission. But it\'s ironic that the campaigns in Balance of Power were arguably included to provide a better single-player experience, and yet they are extremely difficult for a single player to complete on the default difficulty level. Fortunately there are easier skill levels for frustrated gamers to meekly resort to and even a harder one for gamers who are ""one with the force."" You can also play each mission from the perspective of different flight groups, which enhances replayability by giving you different (often more challenging) mission objectives, and gives you additional opportunities to experiment with the Rebel B-Wing fighter (which is usually not your default choice). <P> For an affordably priced expansion pack, Balance of Power provides outstanding value. In addition to the campaigns and cutscenes, Balance of Power also adds eight new separate ""combat engagements"" (single missions to accomplish specified objectives), one new ""battle"" in which you can link the combat engagements together, and two melees (free-for-all shoot-em-ups). While the only new ship available to you is the Rebel B-Wing fighter, Balance of Power also adds five new capital ships (including the formidable Super Star Destroyer), two new starship bases, and a new gun emplacement platform. Although a 3D patch for X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter was made available some time ago, Balance of Power does automatically add the latest version of the patch and cleans up a few textures. You can now program your own ""taunts"" to gleefully mock your hapless foes. Finally, Balance of Power adds the familiar ""white streaks of light"" hyperspace effect, which was notably absent from the original game. Gamers who have been disappointed by uninspired expansion packs that haphazardly slap together a bunch of single-player missions, throw in a couple of new multiplayer arenas and a handful of units, and call it a day, will be pleasantly surprised with Balance of Power. Balance of Power provides more gameplay than most full games. The only things missing are new sound effects and (Star Wars-fan sacrilege alert!) new music. Don\'t get me wrong - I love John William\'s Star Wars music as much as the next guy, but hasn\'t LucasArts milked the Star Wars theme songs enough? Keep the classic music (what Star Wars game would be complete without the Imperial March), but let\'s have a few new chords next time. <P> Minor complaints aside, Totally Games and LucasArts have finally delivered the game that was so anxiously anticipated prior to X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter\'s release. Balance of Power perhaps arrives a little late, but it is certainly successful in making X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter one of the best games to be released in 1997 - and is still the only multiplayer space sim worth its weight in Jawas. <i>--Desslock</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Magic the Gathering: Duels of the Planewalkers - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['As the television ads for the card-based version of Magic: The Gathering proclaim, ""All you need is a brain, a deck, and a friend."" Until the release of the multiplayer ManaLink patch in early February, MicroProse had provided plenty of decks but didn\'t allow players to compete against human opponents. Fans of the series were beginning to think the designers at MicroProse were the ones lacking brains. Duels of the Planeswalkers, the latest installment in MicroProse\'s Magic series, combines ManaLink, over 480 cards, and the Magic game engine - but the original release of Magic: The Gathering for the PC was over a year ago, and fans may find this add-on to be too little, too late. <P> In giving credit where credit is due, Duels is not solely an expansion pack. All of the elements found in the original Magic package can be found in Duels: 403 cards from the Fourth Edition set, two modes of gameplay (duel and campaign), a video-enhanced tutorial, faithful card art reproduction, and a plethora of pre-built decks. Duels even includes several interface enhancements and tournament options  la Spells of the Ancients, as well as 80 new cards from Legends and The Dark sets. <P> All of this makes Duels more of a rerelease than an add-on, but those of you who bought Magic when it hit the streets may be a bit peeved at MicroProse. Duels is the product that should have been released last year: a full-featured Magic engine that allows mano-a-mano duels via the Internet. Even if you own Magic and Spells of the Ancients and you only want the 80 new cards to enhance your decks (ManaLink is available to registered users for free via the Internet), you have to shell out another $30 for Duels ($45 street price with a $15 rebate). This means that dedicated players who have been with the series since the beginning will have to pay approximately $120 to play multiplayer Magic via the Internet with all of the available cards, giving way to the real magic behind both the card and computer-based version of Magic: its ability to mysteriously suck money from your pocket. <P> Duels is definitely aimed at newbies to Magic and, as a stand-alone product, it\'s a damn fine translation of the card game. However, for players who have been behind MicroProse\'s Magic from the beginning, Duels is almost useless and really just serves to piss you off. If you\'re new to Magic and are interested in the possibility of playing against your friends over the Internet or via a LAN, modem, or direct connection, you may want to check out Duels. But for you old-school Magic players out there, Duels of the Planeswalkers is simply not worth the price. <i>--Tal Blevins</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Worms Armageddon,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['It was the good PC game for your computers and laptops to play on for Worms fans only.', ""The spineless and unassuming critters that star in Worms Armageddon epitomize the game itself. You'll quickly notice that the worms in this game are not as meek as they appear and instead are funny, ill-tempered, and wickedly clever. At about the same time, you'll find that while this game may look cute, it is in fact as sophisticated and enjoyable as the very best strategy games out there. It's also highly polished, easily customizable, accessible to all ages, and perfectly suited for quick spells and marathon sessions alike. <P> That said, it's true that Worms Armageddon isn't all that different from Worms 2. Though it includes an all-new single-player campaign and fully integrated online play, as well as over a dozen new weapons and gadgets for the worms to use, Armageddon looks, sounds, and plays similarly to the last episode, which means veterans of the series expecting something totally new will not find what they're looking for. And everyone else will wish Worms Armageddon offered even more, if only because it's as good as it is. <P> Worms Armageddon is easy to play and control, two factors that contribute immensely to the game's success. The typical skirmish pits teams of worms against each other, all randomly interspersed throughout some sort of exaggerated landscape ranging from garbage dumps to stacks of books. You take turns with your opponents, inching your forces into position one by one and firing upon enemy worms with an arsenal of weapons, from traditional (grenade, shotgun) to makeshift (baseball bat, blowtorch) to unorthodox (exploding old woman, skunk). The worms even know a few famous martial arts moves for good measure. Most worm weapons are absurd and amusing, and effectively serve specific functions. But since many do overlap in functionality, you can be selective and creative with your arsenal rather than feel restricted by it. You'll witness the events that transpire as the worms duel to the death via a traditional 2D platform-game side view, lending Worms Armageddon a readily approachable if misleadingly simple appearance. <P> So although it may appear as if that one worm over there just fired a bazooka at his enemy across the screen, aiming that shot was anything but trivial. A worm, not unlike a golfer, needs to take into account such elements as trajectory, wind direction, and power, and although shooting simply involves arrow keys and the space bar, hitting the target won't be quite so simple. Even seemingly fail-safe weapons, like homing missiles and napalm strikes, require skill and foresight to be used effectively. What's more, explosive attacks, such as the bazooka, vaporize the terrain around the targeted area, likely causing the worms in the vicinity to be flung about. It's often to your advantage to try to destroy the earth from under the feet of your enemies rather than target them directly, in an effort to send them careening into the water below, since worms can't swim. <P> Thanks to the game's sophisticated physics and damage modeling, the results of your attacks will often prove surprising no matter how accurate you think you are. Since maps tend to be strewn with explosives, and the worms themselves explode when they die, oftentimes the results of a successful strike are anything but predictable as an incredible chain reaction ensues. This tightly controlled chaos, together with the precise targeting system and plausible physics, is also essential to this game's success. And the automatic instant replay on especially unbelievable chains of events is a nice touch. <P> Great graphics and sound don't hurt, either. Worms Armageddon includes a seemingly endless assortment of beautiful and surreal backdrops, which lend most every skirmish a unique challenge, since these landscapes are randomly generated each time. The worms themselves are animated beautifully, and their articulate expressions and bizarre arsenals make these some of the most endearing computer game characters in a long time. Meanwhile, special effects such as fire and explosions all look equally good, lending the game a perfectly consistent and always bright and attractive appearance. <P> The sound effects that accentuate the firefights, while somewhat repetitive, are as over-the-top and amusing as the graphics, while a rather remarkably grandiose militaristic soundtrack enhances the game's tongue-in-cheek half-seriousness. More remarkable still is to what extent you can customize your worms: As a holdover from its predecessor, Worms Armageddon includes dozens upon dozens of sound schemes for the little guys, most of which are high-pitched, angry squeals. You can make your worms speak Russian, Greek, Afrikaans, around a dozen dialects of English, French, Spanish, German, you name it. Or you can import your own sound effects, just as you can also select a team anthem, an insignia, a tombstone, and customize just about everything else about your team, giving it a unique style that will distinguish you among your peers in a grueling multiplayer match. <P> Those custom features aptly suggest that Worms Armageddon lends itself perfectly to multiplayer competition. The fully integrated Worms.net Internet play server (though not ideally fast or reliable at all hours as of press time) lets you easily join a game with rival worm commanders from across the world, and the server even maintains your ranking and status based on your wins and losses. Because battles are highly customizable, such that starting conditions for health and ammunition can be easily adjusted, you can join games that emphasize the style of play you prefer, either in favor of mass-destructive or more strategic weaponry. In between multiplayer sessions, you can play against the computer in quick matches or deathmatch battles that become progressively more challenging, just as you can learn the ropes through a convenient if somewhat difficult training mode, then apply them in the single-player campaign. The campaign missions, which must be played through linearly, are mostly puzzle-oriented and recall Psygnosis' classic Lemmings in that they tend to force you to make precise use of a limited supply of tools in order to accomplish your objectives. The puzzle elements of these missions oftentimes prove frustrating, since many of these missions are very difficult, and while the campaign provides an enjoyable diversion from the rest of the game, it doesn't really hold up on its own, nor does it seem intended to do so. <P> Likewise, although the computer opponent is realistically fallible except at the highest skill levels, it tends to neglect the more obscure or sophisticated weapons available, resorting to mundane explosives nine times out of ten. For this reason alone, the computer cannot ever hope to provide the sort of unique competition that is practically assured with even the most inexperienced human opponent, whose foibles and follies in combat will likely be worth the price of admission if he isn't good enough to fight back in earnest. <P> It's too bad that the computer opponent doesn't make full use of its full arsenal, and as you play Armageddon more and more, invariably you'll also wish the game had even more weapons, even more diversity in graphics and sound, and even more of pretty much everything. There's no mistaking that Worms Armageddon is both highly polished and totally complete, with far more features and variety and options than just about any other game out there. Nevertheless, the design and execution are so great and so open-ended that you'll know, even as you log more and more hours with the game, that in fact you can't have too much of a good thing. <i>--Greg Kasavin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Magic: The Gathering - Spells of the Ancients,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games']",{},"['Return to an age when the masters of the game dueled with legendary cards, such as the Juz&aacute;m Djinn and the Juggernaut. Double the challenge with on-the-spot deck construction in a sealed-deck tournament. The game features cards from the <I>Unlimited, Arabian Nights,</I> and <I>Antiquities</I> sets.', 'Players of the computerized Magic: The Gathering have been waiting for this. MicroProse has finally released Spells of the Ancients, the first expansion set for Magic, and it\'s a top-notch add-on that every MtG player should own. <P> The most obvious addition is the 138 new cards, culled from the Unlimited, Arabian Nights, and Antiquities sets. These are the earliest published sets of the Magic card game, and contain some very rare cards. MicroProse has also included six promotional cards that are among the rarest of all Magic cards ever printed. Cards from these early expansion sets are some of the most powerful around and can quickly boost the force of your deck.  <P> While some developers would consider this alone enough for an expansion pack, MicroProse goes even further - using the add-on to give Magic a much-needed facelift. Spells of the Ancients upgrades Magic: The Gathering to version 2.0 and fixes several of the problems found in the original. SotA revamps the clunky interface, improving aesthetics as well as usability and simplicity. There is also a ""Face Builder"" utility that allows you to create your own persona. Sounds like a neat idea, but it actually boils down to flipping through tons of clip art, which does little but change color. Perhaps the coolest new feature is the addition of sealed-deck tournament play. In the sealed-deck tournament, you must build a deck from unopened Starter Decks and Booster Packs chosen from the various sets. You can then challenge up to thirty-one other AI players using your new deck.  <P> The game itself hasn\'t changed, but several improvements have been added to improve gameplay. Version 2.0 is much more stable than previous versions and I suffered no crashes. It is also easier to avoid combat in the wilderness, making the campaign mode much less tedious. MicroProse has even updated the computer AI, and your computer opponents rarely make obvious flubs. <P> Even with all of these additions, MicroProse still has not included multiplay ability in this new upgrade package.

When ManaLink becomes available (which should be sometime in November), MicroProse will send registered purchasers of SotA the first copies via electronic transfer. <P> With a price tag of around thirty bucks, Spells of the Ancients is an expansion pack that promises a lot of power for a moderate price. New cards, improved features, and sealed-deck tournaments should keep Magic: The Gathering fans busy for a while - and after ManaLink is released, perhaps eternity. <i>--Tal Blevins</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

USAF - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Climb the pyramid to be the top pilot of the most advanced air force in the world: the USAF. Fly and train over U.S. soil in the F-16C Falcon and A-10 Warthog or an arsenal of six other planes. Then relive great historic air battles flying the rugged F-4E over Vietnam or the powerful F-15C in Operation Desert Storm. Finally, push the envelope flying the menacing F-117 Stealth Fighter and ultramodern F-22 Raptor as you project the power of the United States in futuristic campaigns over Europe. If that's not enough, take your skills to the Internet, flying against other aces on JanesCombat.Net."", ""A straight line runs from Chuck Yeager's Air Combat, one of the most revered and influential PC flight sims, to Jane's new survey sim USAF. The Jane's tradition of accessible flight simulations with plenty of planes and options has given us Air Combat, US Navy Fighters, Advanced Tactical Fighters, and Israeli Air Force, with steady improvement and little deviation from the formula. USAF is no exception, but is poised to take the survey sim into new territory. <P> The appeal of this sort of simulation is because of several factors: It has a lot of planes, numerous gameplay options, and moderate realism levels. Together these three elements create a package that gives the more casual fan a taste of air combat without the burden of too much detail. Hard-core simulation fans often shun such games for these same reasons, because the generic controls and lack of extreme realism or detail seem too far removed from the real-world complexities of in-depth sims like Flanker 2.0 and Falcon. <P> There's no question that USAF falls in the midrange on the realism scale. With eight flyable planes, you can't expect the refined flight model and sophisticated avionics of a stand-alone simulation. But for this trade-off you get those eight planes, each with unique cockpits and distinct, if not precise, flight models. To simplify things, controls are shared among the eight planes, so that the F-117 uses the same radar functions as the F-16, and so on. <P> USAF pushes the envelope by taking on several generations of air combat. Planes and missions come from Vietnam, the Gulf War, and the near future, creating a broad canvas of action rarely seen in a flight sim. You can fly in the F-15, F-16, F-22, F-117, F4, MiG 29, F-105, and A-10, plus some variations on these. This diversity serves as a sort of history lesson on the development of jet combat, as you go from the fast gunfights and rudimentary radar of the F-105 and F4 to the hi-tech stealth precision of the F-22. All three eras (past, present, and future) are ably served by full-blown campaigns illustrating the many roles of air combat. The four campaigns include a present-day training situation, Vietnam, the Gulf War, and a hypothetical near-future European conflict. Campaigns are semidynamic, meaning the missions are scripted with some randomization, and resources are tracked throughout the course of the campaign. If you use missiles and lose airframes carelessly, you'll probably find yourself short on funds later in the campaign. It's not the true dynamic battlefield found in the likes of Longbow and Falcon, but the missions are tight and the campaigns are satisfying. <P> The rest of the play options feature the stunning array of game types that are the trademark of the Jane's line. You can create almost any encounter you want with a quick mission option. Air-to-air and strike missions can be configured to pit any aircraft or group against any other in any situation, altitude, and position of advantage. Want to try a wing of Phantoms against a single Strike Eagle? It will take you about a minute. You can also simply start a random quick mission that will choose all these settings for you. Scripted stand-alone missions take on specific historical encounters and elaborate hypothetical scenarios that cover the entire range of air combat. USAF is playable online via Jane's Combat.net matching service, and will also form the core of the forthcoming Jane's World War: a massively multiplayer persistent-world air-combat arena. It will be your first point of entry to this ambitious project, but the beta and final launch dates of Jane's World War are uncertain as of this time. <P> Visually, USAF is inconsistent. The detail on the planes and objects is good, and while terrain looks decent from high altitudes, you'll see some real problems with it once you get down low. The landscape textures have visible seams. There's also an odd kind of texture pop-in as the terrain visibly smoothes during flight. Even the trees and bushes look funny: small, blinking, and quite distracting. Frame rates are adequate on a high-powered system, but the terrain problems in Pixel's Israeli Air Force persist in this newer simulation. In high-altitude aircraft this isn't a problem, but with the mud runs of the A-10 and F15, it becomes more of an issue. <P> Graphical flaws aside, USAF continues a revered tradition of accessible and diverse Jane's flight simulations. There are more missions and planes in this one package than in a dozen other recent sims, and its diverse features and the important place USAF will have in Jane's World War will keep it flying for a long, long time to come. <I>--Tony Lopez</I> <P> --<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

(Ages 17 and older)"", ""Phantasmagoria is Sierra's first attempt at a full-blown, live-action, interactive video adventure, and their ambition far outweighs the results. A four-plus-million-dollar budget and over two years in production do not necessarily translate into high quality gaming."", 'Much of Phantasmagoria is spent on typical adventure activities: exploring, grabbing items, and problem solving. And on that level, the game is reasonably enjoyable. In addition, the graphics are excellent, the music is emotive, and there are many pleasant surprises. But problems arise in several areas: experienced adventurers will find Phantasmagoria generally unchallenging, the characters weak, the violence over-the-top, and the script just lame. For instance, during day one Adrienne discovers a secret chapel full of bizarre items yet doesnt think it important enough to tell her husband. On day two, she barely breaks a sweat over the fact that her hubby has transformed from a loving partner to a crazed lunatic.', 'Many of this titles problems come from complexities inherent in taking a huge concept and trying to wring a game out of it. Somebody forgot to do some detailed planning and fine-tuning. This is clear from the character interactions, the repetitive nature of some scenes, and the unrealistic puzzles--the telescope eyepiece ""glints"" in the sand only after you discover you need it, even though youve walked by that spot several times already.', ""So why is Phantasmagoria so darned popular? It's accessible to newbies, it's a new genre, and Sierra has promoted the hell out of it. The built-in hint system can turn this into a cakewalk and you'll be wowed by the occasional top notch production values. Unfortunately, the repetitive violence may turn the newcomers off just as quickly. My recommendation: Phantasmagoria is only for the gaming-challenged. Otherwise try Gabriel Knight: The Beast Within.

Record single and multiplayer games for later playback. A printed 184-page manual and a 152-page full-color <I>Compendium of the Starsiege Universe</I> are included.', ""While it may seem that giant robot sims comprise a prolific genre, the three facts remain that nobody but Activision has made one in years, that no one but Activision ever did a very good job, and that Activision only got it right with the original MechWarrior 2. As such, the nebulous mech genre remains unrefined, and in recent years, underrepresented. If nothing else, then, Sierra's Starsiege brings new life to a genre otherwise devoid of it, even if it doesn't really succeed in elevating robot sims out of their long-term rut. It's a great looking game, and a lot of energy was put into its story and setting, but that energy should have been redistributed in the interest of gameplay. <P> Sierra's always wanted you to notice the Earthsiege universe. Starsiege is the sixth game in the universe, and it tries harder than ever to get you involved in the story. You get a book dedicated exclusively to setting the scene, with a complete historical account of the future conflict. That's in addition to the actual gameplay manual, which is also first-rate. The plot is fully realized within the game, with cinematic cutscenes, mission briefing voice-overs, and in-engine scripted sequences, all of which attempt to draw you into the game. The attempt succeeds, and were it not for the story you'd have a harder time accepting some of Starsiege's problems that gradually become evident. <P> Starsiege's 3D engine is fast and colorful, and the terrain looks authentic, with atmospheric hazing that creates a believable sense of scale. You'll actually feel isolated in the immense landscapes if you stop to look around, but despite the desolate Solar System settings, the detailed terrain always looks beautiful. The stars shine at night, the sun beats down during the day, and foreboding half-buried derelict machinery adds that extra incentive to get out of there alive. This rich scenery will look familiar to Starsiege: Tribes players, who've long since realized the tactical advantages that go hand-in-hand with being able to see an enemy as it appears as a speck on the horizon. <P> Terrain notwithstanding, the giant robots in Starsiege look rather plain. Most of the vehicle designs are forgettable even if they are highly detailed, although a few of the larger machines look particularly sinister. You can quickly identify the weapons on any given adversary, and all are especially well animated, and pivot and recoil discernibly. However, the vehicles themselves don't manage to convey the appropriate sense of scale because they move about just a little too quickly and end up looking like they're made of plastic rather than heavy metal. The destruction of a target exacerbates the sense that these are toys rather than war machines, as they merely split apart at the seams and the pieces go twirling around. Fortunately, the fiery explosions themselves look good, as do the various colorful weapon special effects. <P> Still, what really hinders suspension of disbelief in Starsiege is not so much the look of the game, but rather its strangely subdued sound effects. Some of the largest machines in the game hardly even make a sound as they walk about, and even when they go up in flames, the explosions are strangely silent. Meanwhile, the CD audio soundtrack is an inconsistent mix of techno and bass-heavy industrial tunes, some of which are inspiringly fast-paced, while others are embarrassingly bad. At least the voice acting in the mission briefings and other story sequences is consistently good. But if Starsiege had only sounded more visceral, that would have helped compensate for its gameplay. <P> It isn't the case that Starsiege plays badly; it's fast for a giant robot sim, and the campaign missions are tough, concise, and mostly well designed. But the problem is that Starsiege seems confused. The game abandons the typical torso-twisting mechanics of the genre for a control scheme that demands comparison with first-person shooters. Forget your flight stick - the game practically demands you aim using the mouse, with which you can pinpoint your weapons quickly on any area of the screen. This becomes especially critical if you pilot a tank instead of a walker, as tanks can swivel their weapons in a full radius. Yet no matter how precise you think you are, hit detection in Starsiege feels suspiciously inconsistent, and you'll often miss your mark even though you swore you had it in your sights. At other times you'll hit, or get hit, but won't notice. The Starsiege machines don't ostensibly respond to damage and just continue to go about their business, while your HUD doesn't clearly represent how much damage you've taken. <P> It isn't difficult to overlook Starsiege's many minor faults, in light of what it actually does right: the game looks good, and its story is well integrated. Its vehicles are fully customizable, and the game plays well without feeling either simplistic or obtuse. Multiplayer Starsiege, your only other option besides the campaign, isn't to be overlooked either. The game includes complete Internet multiplayer functionality straight out of the box, with plenty of deathmatch and capture-the-flag maps, as well as the option to host custom servers with whatever restrictions you like. CTF Starsiege is quite fun, and makes a lot of sense since the smaller, faster vehicles in the game are ideal flag runners, but entirely incapable of fighting against larger opponents. Then again, the overall slower pace will take a lot of getting used to for Tribes players, most of whom will probably prefer that game's more dynamic feel. After all, the vehicles in Starsiege control about the same as Tribes' foot soldiers, but they're slower and can't even jump. <i>--Greg Kasavin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Return to Krondor - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""This sequel to <i>Betrayal at Krondor</i> offers many elements of the original game while taking advantage of technological advances. Players trek to investigate the disappearance of the Ishapian church's most sacred relic, the Tear of the Gods."", 'After an incredible series of twists and turns during development, the official sequel to one of the most popular role-playing games ever, 1993\'s Betrayal at Krondor, has finally arrived. Unlike last year\'s Betrayal in Antara, which was very similar in style, if not in quality, to Betrayal at Krondor, the official sequel is a very different game from its predecessor. <P> Return to Krondor, like Betrayal at Krondor, is set in author Raymond E. Feist\'s swords-and-sorcery world of Midkemia. Both games provide strongly story-driven experiences, as evidenced by the fact that they are divided into ""chapters,"" during which the plot is advanced in a very linear, predetermined fashion. Similarly, both games require you to use preset characters, each possessing a fully developed, distinctive personality, and determine party membership solely in response to plot developments over which you have no control. But while Betrayal at Krondor allowed you to develop your character in a variety of ways while exploring a vast gaming world and undertaking numerous subquests, Return to Krondor offers much more restrictive gameplay. Each chapter in Return to Krondor is set in a very discrete, confining geographic area (one room, in the case of two of the chapters), and most chapters have no subquests at all, forcing you to focus solely on your primary quest objectives. The handful of available subquests are all interesting and do an excellent job at drawing you deeper into Krondor\'s world, and the main storyline is consistently compelling. In fact, you are likely to race through the already brief game because the lure of advancing the storyline by proceeding directly to the next key objective is difficult to resist. <P> Set directly in the city of Krondor and its nearby surroundings, Return to Krondor\'s main plot involves retrieving an immensely powerful artifact, the Tear of the Gods, after it was relegated to a watery grave by an ambitious pirate, Bear. Bear has been carving a grisly path of destruction throughout the world of Midkemia as he has sought to capture the power of the Tear of the Gods to achieve his nefarious ends. To hastily save the day, a not-so-unlikely band of heroes is formed, consisting of a reformed master thief, an exotic court mage, a vengeful member of the city guard, a priest hailing from the temple that previously maintained the lost artifact, and finally, a reluctant guildsman who has been known to hurl a spell or two upon occasion. <P> While Betrayal at Krondor was primarily a first-person-perspective game, Return to Krondor opts for a stylish, but occasionally disorienting, variety of third-person perspectives. Unlike the suddenly abundant third-person-perspective games using a ""trailing camera,"" in Return to Krondor the camera angles are stationary in each scene, although you can choose from a variety of camera views in most key encounter areas in the game. As you move your party through the gaming world, using either directional keys or by simply mouse-clicking on a targeted location, you prompt automatic shifts in the game\'s camera perspective. The frequently shifting camera perspectives is often disorienting, since clicking on a location at the top of your screen regularly results in your characters actually moving towards the bottom of the screen after an involuntary camera switch. In the vast majority of outdoor locations, you can\'t readily switch back to a previous perspective, making it easy to initially lose orientation as you suddenly view the gaming world from a different angle. <P> The differences between the Direct3D version of the game and the proprietary ""True 3D"" software version are minor, which is a compliment to the software version rather than a critique of the hardware-accelerated version. The lush background scenery in the game is often truly beautiful, and the characters are rendered in great detail, with distinctive faces (complete with lip-synching mouths) and appearances that change to reflect their equipped armor and weaponry. Scripted cutscenes are plentiful and do an excellent job of keeping you immersed in the gaming world while advancing the plot and further developing the personalities of characters in the game. <P> Combat in the game is turn-based although not as tactical as typical turn-based role-playing games because you have fewer options available to your characters. Combat is always to the death (apparently there\'s no such thing as a well-advised retreat among the bloodthirsty Krondorians) and, with some notable exceptions, usually occurs in a relatively confined area. There are six schools of magic (four for mages, two for priests), and spells cast during combat exhibit suitably colorful and otherwise impressive effects. Mage spells can either be ""quick cast"" immediately, which could result in a spell failure, or ""slow cast"" over two turns, in which case the spell will be lost if the caster is hit prior to launching the spell. Priest spells are always successfully invoked and can be cast using spell points or, for the masochist in you, the life points of the caster. Unlike Betrayal at Krondor, combat does not occur on a separate ""grid-like"" combat screen. There is always a color-coded circle beneath the active character or enemy in combat, allowing you to instantly determine the relative health and spell points of that character or enemy. Unfortunately, while the lack of a clearly marked movement ""grid"" makes the environment more immersive, it also makes it difficult to quickly determine a character\'s movement range. <P> Both of the previous Betrayal games featured complicated methods of opening treasure chests found during the course of the game. But instead of punishing gamers with the notoriously tedious ""bead"" puzzles of Betrayal in Antara or the riddle puzzles in Betrayal at Krondor, this time the treasure chests actually add to gameplay, rather than distract from it. A thief\'s task of unlocking and disarming a chest is graphically represented in Return to Krondor, albeit in a somewhat abstract manner. Gamers still not wanting to mess around with the puzzle chest can elect to have the game automatically determine whether or not the thievish Squire James is successful at opening a chest based solely upon his lock-picking and disarming skills. You\'ll gather hoards of treasure from defeated foes during the course of the game and unfortunately also spend a significant amount of time tediously identifying or moving that treasure from corpses to your characters\' backpacks. Each individual item in the game has to be specifically assessed and moved, and your victims\' bodies have to exasperatingly be searched one by one. <P> The game\'s main problem, however, is clearly its brevity. Although there are a few difficulty settings and the option to make mages more or less effective at spell-casting, these alternatives are unlikely to significantly prolong the game\'s replayability. Return to Krondor is certainly not a massive and open-ended role-playing game set in an expansive gaming world. With its distinctive, preset characters, scripted events, and limited geographical scope, Return to Krondor is a more linear, story-driven, and somewhat more intimate game. While Return to Krondor may not be an epic sequel to Betrayal at Krondor, its excellent graphics and immersive plot and gaming world make it an enjoyable story-driven game while it lasts. <i>--Desslock</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

I thought I was fairly adept at your average brake-accelerate PC racer, but NASCAR draws a thin line between exhilarating action-racing and strategic planning. This is a game where every track must be considered individually when tweaking the design of your car, where you need to know where and when to pit, all while staying aware of your competition\'s position on the road. After a few hours of roaring around the oval, taking cues from your spotter through a headset (let\'s assume you\'re wearing headphones during your game) it becomes startlingly clear: NASCAR 2 is so realistic, it\'s scary. <P> First of all, NASCAR 2\'s graphics are top-notch. Sierra has improved on the frame rate of the first game, making for fluid car animation, and realistic body damage. Simply put, this is as close as most of us are going to come to participating in an actual televised race. As an added bonus, Sierra has included a paintshop-style program where you\'re given the opportunity to customize the artwork of any car on the track. Slap your dog\'s name on the hood, a smiley face on the bumper. The association doesn\'t care: In NASCAR 2 the car is your canvas. <P> I don\'t mean this wholly in an artistic sense. Half the fun of NASCAR 2 is making the ever-so-slight adjustments to your vehicle\'s tire pressure, foil height, camber, and gear ratios to achieve optimal performance for a particular track. Experienced racers - whether they\'re the real McCoy or just veteran desktop competitors - will know what all these arcane terms mean from the start. However, before hitting the first NASCAR track, most of us are going to need an quick learner\'s course. An easy to understand which-element-on-your-car-affects-what diagram made it all clear, and in no time at all I began to experiment until I felt I had a firm grasp on exactly what I could tweak to make my V-8 the finest machine on the track. <P> The AI in the game is pretty incredible. When you accidentally blindside another vehicle (or even on purpose, if you don\'t believe in good sportsmanship), the other cars realistically slow down or cautiously slide out to avoid a collision. It\'s funny, but although NASCAR 2 doesn\'t purport itself as being the kind of body-casualty ride that Psygnosis\' Destruction Derby 2 is (with its incredibly realistic incremental car damage - fenders mashing in, hoods flying off, wheels tearing from their axles, bouncing down the track, requiring a tow into the pit-stop), it certainly rivals that game damage-wise. . If you collide with another vehicle because you performed an action contradictory to your spotter\'s directions, he\'ll remind you of your ineptitude with a reprimanding ""What kind of bone-headed move was that!"" And at that point, you\'re probably so absorbed in the race that you\'ll want to go back and apologize to him personally. <P> That\'s the kind of complete immersion NASCAR 2 offers. It\'s a completely professional game, both in its execution and in its dedication to the NASCAR tradition. In fact, it\'s so that Sierra and NASCAR have teamed up to bring the game to TEN (the online Total Entertainment Network) to allow players to compete and achieve ""official"" NASCAR standings in an Internet roster. Now how cool is that? People who played and worshipped the original NASCAR already own this game. I\'m writing this review largely for gamers out there who are intimidated by realistic sims. Games like Grand Prix 2 and now NASCAR 2 have converted me: I can now rest my rocket-launcher temporarily to carry on some in-depth racing. <i>--Tim Soete</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Race actual cars on real-world courses throughout North America and Europe. Tune and customize you car for ultimate performance, then compete against computer-controlled opponents designed to simulate the driving styles of the real-life drivers.', 'Remember Chuck Yeager\'s Air Combat? All right, maybe not - and even if you do you\'re probably wondering what on God\'s green earth a dated WWII air-combat game has to do with an auto-racing sim. So I\'ll clear things up for you with a little homespun aphorism that more game developers should take to heart: If it feels real, it is real. Chuck Yeager\'s flat polygons might look bland today, but when I saw them from a virtual cockpit eight years ago I felt as if I really were in the skies above war-torn Europe - a lot like the way I feel when I start a race of Sports Car GT and am nearly as excited, tense, and focused as if I were on the start line at Laguna Seca in an exquisite road racer. <P> Admittedly, Sports Car GT doesn\'t dish up the most jaw-dropping graphics you\'ve ever seen (though they are good), and its modeling of car and engine damage will leave a lot of sports-car fans wishing that real life were as forgiving. But make no mistake: When you slam the pedal to the floor and kick one of these high-priced monsters into first gear, you will feel like you\'re out on the track bumping and scraping with the big boys. The 3D modeling here is so good, so convincing, that you\'ll find yourself in a severe fit of road rage when a driver cuts you off at a curve or some idiot spins out and blocks that perfect line you\'d been following for the last three laps. <P> Fans of high-dollar sports cars will find that the menu in Sports Car GT is enough to set their mouths watering, with cars from BMW, McLaren, Porsche, Panoz, Vector, Mosler, Callaway, Lister, and Ford (the Saloon Mustang). And the settings are more than good enough for these fancy entrees - the game boasts world-famous courses such as MoSport Park, Road Atlanta, Laguna Seca, Donnington, Hockenheim, and Lime Park, along with a trio of fictional tracks that stand up pretty well on their own merits. Perhaps the reproductions of the real-life tracks aren\'t 100 percent genuine, but not a lot of folks are going to spot the discrepancies - and even if they did, they couldn\'t deny that this sim delivers the spirit, if not the letter, of what it\'s like to scream down these legendary circuits. And if you stick with it long enough, you\'ll start seeing famous names like Brabham, Pilgrim, O\'Connell, and Bernard in the field. <P> I could rave about graphical effects like accurate mirrors, roiling smoke from spinouts, the way computer-controlled drivers have an uncanny tendency to make mistakes at crucial moments (just like we lowly humans do), or how the multitude of car setup options are both easy to understand and actually affect how fast your rig makes a lap. I could rattle on about how a replay reveals that your car\'s chassis shifts to reflect ""inertial forces"" (that means that you can see it rise up as you crest a hill or see it sway to the left or right when you\'re making a powerslide through a tight turn). But none of that means squat if the game doesn\'t deliver that precious adrenaline rush when you\'re out on the track - and if you don\'t get that feeling when you\'re driving in this game, you\'ll probably never get it. <P> Hold on a minute. I forgot to tell you how this beast that\'s been sucking up all my spare time actually works. Sports Car GT lets you hop into those fancy cars for quick races (a mere two cars and four tracks at the start of the game), enter a career mode (win money and add better equipment for handling, braking, suspension, etc.), or race against other people in a multiplayer game (but unfortunately there\'s no support for a matching service like the Internet Gaming Zone or even a chat area to exchange IP addresses). <P> Perfect as it seems, though, Sports Car GT doesn\'t get everything right. The bulk of the gripes stem from the fact that this game was made for both consoles and PCs (with different developers, however), and EA was apparently striving to make the two versions as similar as possible. You\'ll find many console-style quirks in Sports Car GT, some more annoying than others depending on your idiosyncrasies. There aren\'t global settings for generic stuff like graphics, sound, realism, replay settings, and so on (you have to adjust them for each driver you create); a huge majority of the tracks and cars are locked out until you log enough winning performances in career mode (unless you hack or cheat); and the lack of a true save-game feature means you can easily wreck a career unless you make careful choices when buying cars and equipment. The biggest disappointment is that unless Sports Car GT develops a dedicated fan base, the only official way to find opponents is by posting your name on EA\'s lame and relatively ineffective Multiplayer Matchup (I put my name up a year ago for Madden \'99 and NHL Hockey \'99 and have received only one response). <P> The good news is that Sports Car GT is so downright addictive that you can easily overlook these shortcomings. The game demands a lot in PC horsepower - my guess is something around a 333MHz with a ton of RAM and a really good 3D card - but if you\'ve got it then you haven\'t got any reason not to give this game a spin unless you hate racing games. And if that\'s the case, then there\'s this old WWII flight sim called Chuck Yeager\'s Air Combat that you might want to check out. <i>--Chris Gregson</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

While not quite as old as the tabletop version, Shanghai: Dynasty - Activision's sixth take on the highly popular past time - may be the most ambitious of the computerized translations, integrating a wide array of significant enhancements into an already feature-rich and entertaining system."", 'First introduced eons ago in 1986, the latest entry in the long line of Shanghai products adds several important features and facets of play to the game\'s fairly fundamental concept. For instance, Shanghai: Dynasty now boasts multiplayer compatibility (offering IPX, modem, and Internet accessibility); several competitive single- and dual-player modes; ""Shanghai for Kids,"" a tailored version of the game that\'s ideally suited to teaching children the basics; a tournament mode; a custom tile and layout editor; and, for the first time, mah-jongg. Now you can hook up with fellow online enthusiasts and partake in a lively parlor session of mah-jongg, Classic Shanghai, or the all-new Dynasty and Pandemonium, two rather intriguing derivatives that breathe new life into this somewhat tired favorite. In Dynasty, you lock horns with up to four savvy computer-controlled opponents in a race to see who can clear their board in the quickest time. In an interesting twist, power tiles - in the form of jokers - have been added to the mix, which, when successfully matched, can cause tiles to be replaced on each of your opponent\'s boards or can locate matches on your own board. In Pandemonium, you again put your prowess to the ultimate test against up to four quick-witted computer-controlled opponents - this time, however, all of the players must compete on the same board, racing against the clock and each other to find and make the most matches before game\'s end. Several new, beautifully crafted tile sets have been developed - astrology, fantasy, prehistoric, and Egyptian hieroglyphics, to name but a few - complete with wondrous animations and exotic sound effects. For the truly adventurous, you may even create your own tile sets using MS Paint - which is incorporated into Windows 95 - and the special template contained within the BMP folder on the Shanghai CD. If you so desire, you may even upload or download your custom-designed tile sets or layouts with fellow Shanghai players, thereby expanding the number of tile sets. And, should you ""paint"" yourself into a corner, a handy ""shuffle"" option has also been included, which scrambles and repositions any unmatched tiles so that play may continue. As a reward for clearing the board, you receive positive predictions, similar to the kinds of messages contained within fortune cookies.', ""So, whether you have an entire afternoon or just a few minutes to kill, try kicking back and booting up Shanghai: Dynasty. It's the perfect respite for the rainy-day blues, combining all the rich, compelling elements of mah-jongg with the challenging interactivity and immediacy afforded by the Internet. Even if you don't have access to a modem, or you prefer to indulge in a solitaire session or two, Shanghai: Dynasty is an impressive and expansive take on the centuries-old classic. <i>--Marc Dultz</i> <br /><i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The Age of Empires Expansion: The Rise of Rome is the highly anticipated add-on to the award-winning, best-selling real-time strategy game Age of Empires. Focusing on the legendary Roman Empire, the Rise of Rome will challenge veterans and novices alike to wage war on an epic scale with four additional civilizations, several unique units, new technologies, and new campaigns, including the showcase campaign that focuses on the Rise of Rome itself. Includes four new civilizations - Carthage, Palmyra, Macedonia, and Rome.', 'Just as the Romans rose up and became the most advanced and powerful nation in the Western Hemisphere at the turn of the millenium, so too do the Romans replace the old civilizations to reign supreme in Ensemble\'s Age of Empires expansion pack, Rise of Rome. <P> With the planned sequel to Age of Empires pushed back to the middle of next year, the Rise of Rome expansion pack took on new meaning. Not only is it supposed to enhance the value of this year-old favorite, but it also serves as a bridge between Age of Empires and Age of Empires II. Age of Empires loosely followed the growth of the ancient civilizations, Rise of Rome is set during the reign of the Roman empire in the West, and Age of Empires II is to be set in the dark ages, after the infrastructure established by the Romans crumbled into warring pieces. <P> As both a dessert for Age of Empires fans and an appetizer for Age of Empires II, Rise of Rome is a series of hits and misses. I am a huge fan of the original game. I played numerous multiplayer games and even gave the single-player campaigns a good, honest try. I didn\'t really mind the unit limit or the questionable pathfinding. And I forgave the inadequacies of the single-player campaign because I loved multiplayer matches so much. <P> There were many that loved Age of Empires as much as I did, but there were others that just couldn\'t play this game because of a few problems. I couldn\'t really see these problems a year ago when I was first enamored of the game, but today, I finally see just what all the fuss was about: This game is far from perfect, and it has a few shortcomings that detract from the play experience. <P> The Rise of Rome expansion offers five new units, four new civilizations, four new technologies, four new campaigns, and a few user enhancements like unit queues. As expansion packs go, this one is crammed with goodies. Most of the five units were added in response to balance problems in Age. The slinger is a barracks unit that exists to counter the tool age bowman rush. The camel rider serves a similar purpose against the Bronze Age cavalry rush. The scythe chariot was created for those civilizations that lacked a heavy Iron Age cavalry unit. The armored elephant was introduced because the war elephant just wasn\'t being used enough. There wasn\'t an imbalance on the high seas, but the fire galley was nevertheless brought in to expand naval combat. <P> All the units are useful, but you won\'t soon forget the old units because these new ones are either highly specialized or expensive to research. The new additions found in Rise of Rome don\'t really change the game significantly, although they do spice up matches. The slingers and camel riders do mitigate certain rushes, but the game remains fundamentally the same, and some Rise of Rome games will end without the need to ever build an expansion unit. <P> My one issue with the new units isn\'t really a complaint, but an observation. The three ""counter"" units - slinger, camel rider, and fire galley - are highly specialized units that are great against a certain type of unit and pretty much impotent against most of the other units. The scythe chariot and armored elephants are great, although they are expensive upgrades to existing units, in the same fashion as cataphracts and centurions. The scythe chariot addresses some civilizations\' lack of heavy cavalry in the Iron Age. All the new units have good animation and sound, although the lanky gait of the camel rider bothered me. <P> The four new civilizations are good additions to the game, with some nice special abilities to entice you to play them. The two interesting civilizations are the Macedonians (four times as resistant to conversion) and the Romans (master builders). The other two civilizations, Palmryans and Carthaginians, aren\'t quite as interesting. One questionable thing about the new civs is the increased cost of Palmryan villagers, without significant benefits to justify the cost. <P> The four new technologies aren\'t must-haves, but they have their uses. Two make the priest even more powerful, while one adds a nominal bonus to infantry armor against missile attacks, and the other allows you to build barracks units beyond the population limit. I must say that the way Ensemble implemented the priests\' new martyrdom ability (which allows you to instantly convert a unit by sacrificing your priest) leaves much to be desired. Instead of adding a button to the interface to allow you to click to martyr your priest, you have to convert normally and then hit delete. The interface of the game is otherwise good, but this seems to me more like a last-minute work-around. Couldn\'t Ensemble have just spent the time to add a button to the priest interface? <P> Probably the best thing about the expansion pack is the suite of user enhancements, which includes adjustable unit limits, unit queues, and adjustable pathfinding. These improvements do make the game better. <P> As in the first, the single-player game is the biggest drawback. The campaigns are unusually short, which is fine. However, there are no cutscene rewards for campaign victories. Many individual scenarios had interesting premises, but there is no purpose for the overall campaigns, just a loose theme and some random missions. I had hoped that Ensemble would make the solo experience more rewarding, but it isn\'t. The scenarios within each campaign play more like a puzzle game. These new missions are hard, not because the artificial intelligence is more challenging, but because the scenario setup is more puzzle-like and tedious. <P> The other thing that really diffused my enjoyment of the expansion was the terrible pathfinding. I forgave it in Age of Empires, and even though it has been improved, it is still bad. Invariably, when you tell a group of units to go around a forest to get to another point, half of them will get stuck in the trees, too stupid to know to walk around the foliage. <P> Rise of Rome is not a must-buy. I like parts of the expansion pack, but there isn\'t enough compelling content to make me want to go out and add it to my multiplayer matches. All the additions are nice, but they aren\'t necessary for your continued enjoyment. If you are a big Age of Empires fan, you\'ll want to check out the new units and civilizations, as well as the user enhancements, but you won\'t be getting a significant upgrade to the single-player experience or the pathfinding, two problems that Ensemble knew were in the original but somehow didn\'t address in this expansion pack. <I>--Elliott Chin</I> <BR><I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Close Combat III: The Russian Front,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Set on the Eastern Front -the greatest struggle in history - the game spans the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union through the gates of Moscow, the factory complex of Stalingrad, to the 1945 fall of Berlin. The game features real-time, historically accurate warfare at a squad level along with psychological elements for maximum authenticity. Playing either the German or Soviet side, gamers are challenged to out- think and out-fight their opponent while keeping their troops alive. They start as low-ranking commanders and manage unit upgrade and maintenance as they attempt to advance in rank and acquire more troops and equipment.', 'At first glance, Close Combat IIII seems a lot like Close Combat II, which in itself is not a terrible thing. The game runs comfortably on older hardware, and thankfully Atomic hasn\'t jumped on the ""every game needs to be 3D"" bandwagon that has become so pervasive in the industry. Graphically it looks just like Close Combat II with photo-realistic terrain and smoothly animated units. The sound effects seem a tad bit weaker than in previous games. They still sound great, but Close Combat III doesn\'t have quite the symphony of death as the previous installment. It could be because the fighting is more spread out, thanks to the larger maps. The size of the maps, which are three times the size of Close Combat II\'s battlefields, is the first real gameplay difference you\'ll notice. They give you more room for maneuvering but at the expense of a lot of hurrying up and waiting. The first general difference you\'ll notice is the enormous scale of the game. Instead of focusing on one operation, Close Combat III focuses on the entire Eastern Front from 1941 to 1945. This opens up a huge array of weapon platforms and troops for dealing death, and hey, variety is always a good thing in a game. <P> The interface hasn\'t changed drastically but has been improved. No longer is a quarter of the screen taken up by the status bar. Instead, a single bar informs you of everything you need to know, though it only concentrates on one unit at a time. There is also an option to expand the bar to include all your forces. Right clicking on a unit brings up the command list, which now includes the ""ambush"" command. Ambush sets your troops to hide and come out only if the enemy is extremely close. This command and the ""defend"" command are direction sensitive - a feature that is new to the series. Changing directional facing is handled well. Click on a unit with the ambush or defend command, and a circle appears around it, with an arc highlighting its facing. Drag the arc to where you want the unit to face and click again. This is also helpful in positioning idle tanks so they don\'t expose their weak sides to the enemy. <P> Several new gameplay elements have been added. No longer do you have to worry about your troops choosing the most open terrain when you order them to move. Your units can be assigned to move via a series of waypoints, allowing you to pick the most advantageous route. Several new features are borrowed from resource-gathering real-time strategy games such as group numbering, drag selecting, and status bars above the unit. At first they might seem like a gimmick or some sort of attempt to make the Close Combat series appeal to a wider audience. Thankfully the inclusion of these features doesn\'t mean it has been dumbed down for the mass market. In fact, you\'ll come to realize that they add immensely to the experience.<P> Close Combat III allows you to duke it out against live opponents or the excellent AI in single scenarios, operations (a series of linked scenarios), custom-made scenarios, or campaigns. The game really earns its stripes in the campaign mode. Here you start with a small number of units that garner experience as the war drags on. The more battles you win, the higher in rank you go and the more troops you can command. Something new to the series is the inclusion of varying qualities of troops. Now you can choose from conscripts, standard, or elite forces. This really changes the way you plan battles, especially if you\'re leading a horde of conscripts. In between battles you can rest your forces, refit them with different equipment, or retire them out of the campaign. <P> If you\'ve never played a Close Combat game before, the battles will probably be quite a shock. You should expect Saving Private Ryan and not Rambo. Some of your troops will become heroes; others will run shrieking from the enemy. The perfect assault will be broken up by that antitank gun you didn\'t see. You might have expected the enemy to have no tanks, only to find a large contingency of them thundering down on your line. A key leader will die by sniper fire at the most inopportune moment. Unlike other wargames, you won\'t find your units reduced to attack/defense/movement numbers. There are no hexes, nor are there turns. It\'s all played in real time, with each shell computed individually, and morale playing a key role. <P> There are a few complaints, though they should be viewed like winning a Porsche and not liking the color; these aren\'t problems per se but rather elements that could have been altered to make the experience even better. First on the list is the way artillery is handled. Off-board artillery finally makes an appearance, but it\'s limited to one type for either side, and the player has no control over it. Being able to buy salvos of various types before a scenario would have been great. Next, you can forget about a Henschel Hs 129 swooping down to devastate Russian armor with its 30mm MK 101 gun. Tac air is once again left out. Finally, the campaigns take place on the same maps as the single battles, which allows you to essentially practice the campaign. It would have been nice to have no prior knowledge of the maps, forcing tactics on the fly. <P> Close Combat III: The Russian Front is the best Close Combat game of the bunch and personally probably the best wargame to grace your hard drive ever. Like that new album, at first it doesn\'t seem to differ greatly from previous works. Some of the new features appear to have been thrown in just to follow the trend. Play it enough, and you\'ll discover all the subtleties that make Close Combat III the magnum opus it is. All developers should look to Atomic Games when making a sequel. Atomic always keeps what works and expands on it with plenty of fresh material. If you want a wargame that tests your tactical skills more than your arithmetic skills, this is that game. It\'s challenging, engrossing, and shows that you don\'t need a P2 450 with two Voodoo 2s in SLI to have a good time. <i>--Scott R. Krol</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Interstate '76: Arsenal - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<I>Interstate '76 Arsenal</I> contains two award-winning, action-packed games. The Gold Edition includes original missions and battles with upgraded features, such as an optimized engine for increased performance. The Nitro gives you new multiplayer maps and novelty vehicles, including an ambulance. This package combines two great games with new weapons, vehicles, and missions."", ""Last year's Interstate '76 was one of the best games of the pre-summer season. A vehicular combat simulation with an original storyline and a well-developed atmosphere, I76 made it a little easier to weather the dry spell that traditionally follows the holiday season. But it wasn't without its problems. There was a somewhat sluggish engine, strange bugs, and a noticeable lack of 3D-accelerator support. And while the newly released Interstate '76 Arsenal addresses the latter, the other problems are even more noticeable now that the game is a year old. <P> The Arsenal combines two products: Interstate '76 Gold Edition (a 3D-accelerated version of the original) and Nitro Pack (a collection of new single-player missions and multiplayer maps, which is also available separately from Activision's web site). Because GameSpot has already reviewed the original (see the link under related games), there's no need to go into too much detail here. Suffice to say, if you haven't played through it already, the game is still well worth your time, and the Nitro Pack missions are a nice bonus in the deal. But if you've already played I76, it's a much more difficult decision. <P> To say the least, the Nitro Pack is a little disappointing on the single-player side. The new missions, while fun, are missing the challenge and the sense of purpose that made it easy to look past I76's faults. There's no story, no cutscenes. It is simply a collection of unrelated missions in which you play as three of the characters from the original: Taurus, Jade, and Skeeter (and if you finish all of their missions, you can play a handful of missions as a brand-new character). As in the stand-alone scenarios included in the original, you can choose any car and any weapons configuration in these missions; there's no salvaging and no need to worry about taking too much damage. As a result, they are far too easy. And while some of the new missions are creative, you can't help but wish there were some overarching story to tie them all together. <P> On the multiplayer side, there are some nice additions. There are new cars and weapons, the ability to limit which weapons are admissible in a game, and enhanced protection against hacked cars. The game is by no means hack-proof, though, and in my few ventures onto Activision's servers I noticed a few suspiciously resilient foes and a great number of braggarts claiming to have hacked vehicles. The most notable addition to the multiplayer game, though, is the new capture-the-flag mode that adds a great deal more strategy and fun than the traditional kill fests of old. There are still a few features that Activision's servers could use, such as pings and the ability to see how many players are on each side in team games. On the whole, though, connecting to a game and getting started is a trouble-free process. <P> As for the graphic enhancements, they are a mixed bag. The 3D support gives a noticeable frame rate boost and some nice new elements such as more detailed vehicles, accurate weapons display, and realistic sky effects. But don't expect awe-inspiring visuals. Even with the visibility set at its highest setting, you'll encounter an enormous amount of pop-up (so much so that it can actually become distracting), strange texture ripping (which is most notable with shadows), and even some annoying effects like 2D smoke and unspectacular explosions. <P> All in all, Interstate '76 Arsenal seems like a missed opportunity. So here comes a very complex recommendation: If you've never played I76, the Arsenal is a good bet; the excellent single-player campaign from the original combined with the new multiplayer options make for some really solid playing. If you're a fanatical I76 fan, you may want to pick up the Nitro Pack just to play through the eyes of some new characters, even if the lack of a campaign is a bit disappointing. But if you're somewhere in between, you should probably just keep your engine idling until a real sequel is released. <i>--Ron Dulin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Clue Chronicles:  Fatal Illusion - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['It\'s New Year\'s Eve, 1938. On board the private yacht of the wealthy and eccentric Ian Masque, you find yourself part of a ""select"" group of guests invited to an ""unusual"" New Year\'s Eve party. Each guest has a story to tell, but their connection to you and to each other remains hidden. Something strange is bound to happen, and everyone is a suspect.<P> Get ready to put your best deductive reasoning to work and unravel the true story behind this game. Along the way, you\'ll find challenging puzzles to solve and minimysteries to unlock. This is a totally engaging mystery adventure that is sure to keep supersleuths entertained--from the opening scene to the exciting cliffhanging climax.', ""In the right hands, the Clue franchise should translate into a fun, engaging computer adventure. The original board game is a campy send-up of the genteel whodunit formula of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers. It has stuffy Brits with silly names like Colonel Mustard and Professor Plum. The setting is a lush '30s-style mansion containing an arsenal of lethal knickknacks like a dagger, a wrench, and a noose. And the game's mildly subversive subtext seems to be that any one of the elite, cultured cast could be a murderer. <P> Don't expect any of the board game's promising elements to get much play in Clue Chronicles: Fatal Illusion, which is the first episode in a lower-priced series of introductory adventure mysteries from Hasbro Interactive. The game's execution is as boring as its characters. You are a private investigator who has been invited to a New Year's 1939 party by the dotty millionaire Ian Masque. En route to his creepy mansion aboard a yacht, you and the other invitees witness Masque's apparent murder by a booby-trapped artifact. The game's afoot. You do the usual adventuring thing - gather objects, question the other guests, and solve a series of familiar mechanical puzzles (crack a combination lock, find the missing gears, etc.). Once at the mansion itself, you help each of the other characters resolve riddles Masque has left behind and so gather together a series of missing jewels. <P> All of the game mechanics are competent and pitched to a novice adventurer, as are the straightforward puzzle solutions. From a first-person view, you move from point to point through prerendered period sets, questioning each guest via a pop-up memo pad of subjects. The scenery design is sparse, and the cutscenes lack any cinematic flair. An inventory of gathered objects also glides up from below. A visual catalog of suspects offers a bit of background and reminds you of each guest's possible motive in offing Ian Masque. The hint system is especially good, in that it lets you access up to three hints of decreasing obscurity at a given juncture in the game. At the very least, Fatal Illusion serves as a fair introduction to the adventure/puzzle style of play. <P> Unfortunately, the game never goes beyond the very least it can do. At heart, it doesn't seem to understand the art of the whodunit. The mystery genre is all about character and motive, hidden desire, and personal secrets, which turn out to be the least compelling parts of the game. The usual suspects are here: a swarthy magician, a playboy, a pair of femmes fatales, a society matron, et. al. But the scripting, voice acting and graphics of the characters are all as wooden as an oak. Interviewing these stiffs is like trying to converse with exhibits at a wax museum. Their background stories are too shallow to be engaging, and they generally spend a lot of time pointing fingers at one another. How could a scriptwriter not have a little fun with the likes of Colonel Mustard or Professor Plumb? Worse yet, the game really isn't about deduction at all. Solving a series of mechanical puzzles rather than unraveling the riddle of human motivation or eliminating suspects advances the action. And the puzzles themselves are rudimentary - you just piece together a half dozen pieces of torn instructions or jiggle a few switches until the thingamabob powers up for you. <P> In fairness to the game's meager ambitions, Fatal Illusion is priced for and pitched to the very casual gaming crowd. If you've played more than one or two adventure games in your time, the difficulty and brevity of Fatal Illusion will be disappointing, as it takes less than six hours to win for even an average player. When it hits the $15 bargain bin (next week sometime), it will make a fair gift for mom and dad or perhaps the neighbors, who just got their first PC. The initial mystery - Who poisoned Ian Masque's puzzle box? - and its surprise conclusion make the game a mild diversion, even if the rest of the journey feels decidedly unmysterious. Nevertheless, and to their credit, the designers integrate the puzzles into the setting and plot more effectively than some more ambitious adventures. <P> But even as an introductory adventure game, Fatal Illusion will make most gamers wince because of its low production values and unimaginative design. Games like it should be putting more effort into weaving an engaging story by adding some suspense and complex characters to the puzzles, because those are the dramatic criteria most new gamers bring to the experience from other areas of entertainment. The real mystery behind Fatal Illusion is why the designers didn't let themselves have more fun with the opportunity to make a Clue game. Why reduce such promising characters into Colonel Bland and Professor Pallid? Why not bring the deduction-oriented gameplay of the board game somehow into the adventure? Whodunit? The real question is whoblewit? <BR>--<I>Steve Smith</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

SimCity 2000 Special Edition - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""This is the most popular sim of all time, cranked up to a high-tech gloss and packaged with all the popular expansion sets. The original SimCity gave players the opportunity to create and oversee the growth of a living city as well as all its problems: crime, pollution, zoning demands, power outages, traffic foul-ups, and the occasional tornado, nuclear meltdown, or wandering monster from the sea. Less a game in the usual sense of the word than a sort of electronic ant farm, SimCity let players see how they fared as mayor, architect and town council. Now SimCity 2000 adds adjustable topography to the fun, using a terrain editor which can create mountains, valleys, ravines, etc. (The new types of terrain also permit the construction of hydroelectric dams and water towers.) Necessitated by this new addition is a new viewing engine, which rotates the player's municipality in 90 degree increments, so that new mountaintop university doesn't block your view of the burgeoning slum down below. As the town progresses through the decades, the sheer size and technological sophistication of your creations become more and more outlandish, and the resultant metropolis ends up looking like something out of Blade Runner. It can take quite a while to become familiar with Maxis' Sim series, and even longer to actually succeed at long-term city goals. Once you get beyond the learning curve, however, the cycle of planning, construction and urban renewal leads to a rewarding creation. And, as always, hard-won cities from earlier versions of the game can be imported for alteration and experimentation. <i>--Chris Hudak/SpotMedia Communications</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Microsoft Entertainment Pack Puzzle Collection - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Power up your gray matter for The Puzzle Collection - featuring games by Alexey Pajitnov, the Russian mastermind behind Tetris.', ""Puzzle games have changed remarkably little over the years. Targeting the widest possible spectrum of users and machines, puzzle games skew towards the lowest common denominator in terms of control complexity and system requirements. The result has been a marked lack of innovation in the genre - most of today's puzzle games bear more than a passing resemblance to titles released five or even ten years ago."", ""In the absence of flashy graphics, immersive sound, or breakthrough technology, the only distinguishing factor between one puzzle game and another is gameplay. That's good news for gaming purists, but bad news for puzzle game designers, as it puts their new creations up against the best games in the genre, even if they were released years ago. This is why you'll almost never read a review of a puzzle game that doesn't mention Tetris - although released in the mid-80s it's still the standard by which all new puzzle games are judged."", ""Needless to say, Tetris is a difficult game to match - even if you're Alexey Pajitnov, Tetris' original designer. Not that he hasn't tried: Pajitnov has designed or endorsed dozens of games subsequent to Tetris, but none of them have even come close to matching the appeal or success of that seminal work."", ""And now he's at it again. Following the end of an association with MicroProse, Pajitnov has returned to the scene via Microsoft's Puzzle Collection. The disc includes ten all-new puzzle games, some of which were designed by Pajitnov, although it's never made clear exactly which ones. This may just be an oversight. Then again, it may not be. Based on the quality of the games on the disc, it would be a surprise if anyone, let alone Pajitnov, would be in a hurry to take credit for them."", 'Not everything in the collection is bad. Rat Poker, which challenges you to create ""hands"" of rats by catching them using manually activated traps, is highly original and reasonably entertaining. Another bright spot is Lineup, a turn-based game that requires you to manipulate variously shaped objects in order to create vertical or horizontal lines (imagine Tetris in quicksand, and you\'ve got the idea). Mixed Genetics, which asks you to breed triplet sets of mutant creatures in order to create a pure breed, plays better than it sounds, and is quite fun once you get the hang of it.', ""But beyond that, it's a slippery slope straight into puzzle hell. Of the remaining seven games, four (Spring Weekend, Finty Fush, Charmer, and Jewel Chase) are decidedly mediocre, with marginal appeal and limited replay value - frankly, they seem more appropriate for a shareware CD-ROM than a retail product from the world's most powerful software company. As for the remaining three games (Fringer, Color Collision, and Muddled Casino), suffice it to say that the first is extremely tedious, the second isn't even a puzzle game, and the third is muddled, indeed."", 'To top it all off, whether good, bad, or mediocre, none of The Puzzle Collection games includes a two-player mode (either competitive or cooperative). For those who enjoy two-player matches - whether in Tetris, Baku Baku, or Bust-a-Move 2 - this is a major omission.', ""Bottom line? If Microsoft and Pajitnov want to make us forget about Tetris, they're going to have to do a lot better than this. <i>--Vince Broady</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Microsoft Monster Truck Madness 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Monster Truck Madness 2 is the sequel to one of the bestselling auto-racing games for the PC. Monster Truck Madness 2 combines outrageous attitude, unrestrained racing, and real monster trucks to provide a fun and exhilarating off-road driving experience across rugged and challenging terrain. Monster Truck Madness 2 adds new tracks and trucks, improved graphics and sound, and variable weather conditions. The game seats players behind the steering wheel of the world's most powerful vehicles as they crush, splatter, jump, and roll their way to victory."", 'Sure, it\'s the Beverly Hillbillies equivalent of sports, but face it, getting into a truck cab perched atop four ludicrously gigantic tires to skid, plow, and roll through sand, mud, and other slop is not without its appeal. Microsoft\'s Monster Truck Madness was an improbable success and its sequel, Monster Truck Madness 2, is just as likely to get gamers to listen to their inner Bubba and take those garish big rigs out for a spin. <P> Monster Truck Madness 2 improves upon the original by throwing in nine new trucks, eleven new tracks, and an honest-to-goodness sports license. The designers wisely recognized that the subtlety of monster truck racing cried out for the added nuance that only a professional wrestling tie-in could bestow. The resulting WCW and NWO license means gamers can drive rigs based on the likes of Stinger and the Outlaws as well as receive a hearty FMV victory salute from Hulk Hogan himself. This time around the trucks also sport deformable bodies to reflect the pounding they take during races. <P> While Monster Truck Madness 2 does have a limited garage feature to modify your truck, nobody\'s going to confuse this with Grand Prix II - the focus here is squarely on straightforward, arcade-type action. Monster trucks aren\'t exactly precision machines, so while you might not experience the adrenaline rush of high-speed racing, you\'ll be busy struggling to keep at least two wheels on the ground as you slide, skid, and spin through every race. Owners of force feedback joysticks will face a happy extra obstacle in their fight to control these unwieldy mechanized beasts. Monster Truck Madness 2 considerately provides three skill levels and an option for automatic gear shifting, allowing you to take your time getting used to the slippery bouncing mayhem that dominates races. <P> Monster Truck Madness 2 has a good mix of both rally and circuit tracks, including the obligatory romp through oil derricks, a tropical island laced with water hazards, and a happy jaunt through a lightning-torn graveyard, complete with caskets. Most tracks feature harrowing jumps and encourage a healthy dose of cheating. As long as you hit your checkpoints, feel free to ignore the track and set your own path. Races can be customized with variable weather conditions - including rain, snow, dense fog, and more - for an extra challenge. And while you can challenge the computer in a race setting, you can\'t try to beat it in the new multiplayer-only Summit Rumble, a monster truck version of King of the Hill. Too bad, because the Rumble is a gas. <P> While 3D acceleration isn\'t required to run the game, playing it on the minimum machine will force you to shut off features to get it to run at an acceptable rate. That said, 3D acceleration is a must if you really want to enjoy Monster Truck Madness 2. A Direct3D-compatible card will get you a great frame rate as well as a bucketload of eye candy including reflective water, beautiful sky effects, and the lovingly detailed truck textures. To really enjoy Monster Truck Madness 2\'s cool graphics, set a race for ""pitch black"" and ogle at the graceful sweep of headlights careening through the track. <P> Monster Truck Madness 2 isn\'t perfect, even as an arcade racer. While it logs best race and lap times for every track, a career or simple season mode would have been a welcome addition. But if you\'ve an itch for wild, fender-busting racing action, Monster Truck Madness 2 might be just the thing to scratch it. <i>--Robert Coffey</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Rollcage - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Rollcage gives you combat action with road racing in an explosive game. Drive your choice of six indestructible vehicles anywhere and on any surface. This next-generation road race includes no rules but high speed and nonstop racing.', 'You\'ve probably seen those radio-controlled cars you can bounce, flip, and spin because the top and bottom are identical; when they land after a jump, they start trucking just as soon as they get enough wheels touching the ground to create some traction. Now imagine that you could not only race a vehicle like that, but that you could also use it to ram anything that gets in your way - other cars, barricades, construction equipment, columns supporting massive buildings, you name it - without taking damage. Add a couple of mounts for weapons and special items like missiles, turbo speed, temporary wormholes, and even a tool that cuts off every competitor\'s engine, and you\'ve got a pretty good idea of what awaits you in Rollcage, an extremely cool arcade racer that does just about everything right. <P> Rollcage developer Attention to Detail obviously didn\'t spend a lot of time concocting a back story to explain why you and five other racers are raising all manner of hell on 20 futuristic tracks; all I figured out from the cryptic manual intro is that ""rollcagers"" are renegades who\'ve made a conscious effort to make their sport as violent as possible after it achieved widespread popularity. That could be viewed as a commentary on everything from music to art, but all I know for sure is that it gives gamers the chance to do stuff they never dreamed of in an arcade racer. <P> This isn\'t the first racing game that puts you behind the wheel of an armed vehicle, but Rollcage stands apart from the pack in several ways. Most racing games - even ones where you\'re shooting at other drivers - put a premium on keeping your car on the track as much as possible. In Rollcage, on the other hand, you can not only bounce and flip and always land wheel-side down, but you also can drive along walls and even on tunnel ceilings. You might wonder just why you\'d bother doing that, but sometimes it\'s the best way to pass an opponent, as well as the only way to grab certain power-ups. Then there\'s the whole notion of collisions. Sure, they slow you down, but hit the right object - a column supporting a building, for instance - and you\'ll be long gone as your opponent either gets buried in debris or runs smack-dab into a smoking heap of rubble. <P> Of course, you might prefer a more direct approach to slowing down your opponents, and that\'s where the power-ups scattered around each track come into play. Homing missiles automatically target the weakest part of structures, letting you bring the walls tumbling down without slowing your own car down; you can also target a vehicle in front of you and flip it out of control. The time warp slows down every car on the track except yours; leader missiles take out - you guessed it - the lead car; the driller bores through almost everything in its path; an ice sheet makes opponents lose nearly all their traction; and the wormhole lets you leapfrog past the car directly in front of you. And power-ups aren\'t limited to offensive weapons, either. Turbo boosts your speed until the scenery is just a blur, and the shield protects you from enemy weapons and decreases the chance of spinouts after collisions. <P> Just like in Motorhead, the relatively humdrum car graphics in Rollcage are more than compensated for by wonderfully detailed trackside scenery - assuming you\'ve got time to admire your surroundings while driving at breakneck speeds, that is. Vast cityscapes, barren volcanic wastelands, lush islands, and busy industrial sites are the sorts of settings you\'ll be racing on, and with the exception of some fairly cruddy 2D trees (common to nearly all arcade racers), the graphics work is top-notch. Even more visually impressive than the scenery are the weapons effects. Use the time warp, and the entire display begins to undulate and sway in a psychedelic haze; fire the leader missile, and you\'ll see brilliant trails of flames as it screams just above the track in search of the front-runner. My fave? The wormhole - it slowly advances on the car in front of you before engulfing it and removing it from your path. <P> You\'ll find all the usual race options here: League competition is the Rollcage equivalent of a season; arcade lets you race on almost all the game\'s 20 tracks; and time attack lets you try to top your own best lap times. A welcome feature is the inclusion of multiple difficulty levels; it takes considerable practice to learn how to handle a car that can drive upside down on a ceiling, but even the newest of newbies can compete on the game\'s easy setting. <P> Even on the easy setting, though, you\'ll run into one of the game\'s few drawbacks: You can get bashed around so much that sometimes you\'ll just want to throw up your hands in defeat. Picture driving bumper cars at 350kph, and you\'ve got a notion of just how disorientating the smash-bang action in Rollcage can be. Practice can help you avoid some of the show-stopping collisions, but even the best drivers can fall victim to multiple collisions and find themselves out of the running - unless they manage to lay their hands on a mighty power-up like the time warp or leader missile, that is, and even those probably won\'t take you from last to first if you\'re running at the highest difficulty setting. <P> Where Rollcage really disappoints, though, is in its multiplayer support. It\'s not that the game doesn\'t offer multiplayer modes - the full suite of connection options are supported, including TCP/IP and serial connections, and split-screen play is available for up to four players on a single system. The real problem is finding opponents: Because Rollcage isn\'t supported on services like Mplayer, HEAT, or the Internet Gaming Zone, about the only way to scare up some mano-a-mano action is to pray that someone on Kali has a copy of the game. Psygnosis should seriously consider providing at least a rudimentary matching service - a bulletin board for posting challenges or a chat room - so its customers can get the most out of their games. No matter how good the single-player game is, it\'s easy to envision just how much fun it would be to go up against human drivers. <P> Action hounds who like their driving spiced with some mayhem will definitely want to add this one to their shopping cart, but even if you\'re not a fan of this sort of fare, you ought to download the demo if only to see the brain-searing weapons effects and topsy-turvy action. And here\'s hoping that Psygnosis puts a little effort into making it easier to find someone to use that wormhole thingy on... <i>--Stephen Poole</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Within this double-sized box are included: the original <i>Quake 2</I>, <i>Mission Pack 1: The Reckoning</i>, <i>Mission Pack 2: Ground Zero</i>, and the <i>Quake 2 Netpack 1: Extremities</i>. As a collector\'s item, <i>Quad Damage</i> will have fans of <i>Quake 2</I> falling over each other with excitement. For anyone who\'s just interested in finding out what the hoopla is about, <i>Quad Damage</i> has everything to get you fully entrenched in the world of this epic game.<P> Unless you\'ve been living in a separatist compound in Idaho you\'ve heard of <i>Quake 2</i>. As a lone Space Marine, you\'re called upon to save the Earth from the vicious Stroggs, a nasty bunch of biomechanical aliens from the planet Stroggos who want nothing more than to destroy this wonderful world of ours. With a plethora of single-player levels, you\'ll while away many a frightful hour as you gib and frag your way to victory. While <i>Quake 2</i>\'s single-player story line has been impugned for being less than interesting, there\'s no debating the fact that the game\'s multiplayer capabilities are topnotch. With eight ""official"" multiplayer levels and a gang of user-created maps available on the Internet you\'ll no doubt put your marriage in jeopardy.<P> <i>The Reckoning</i> is the first Mission Pack to be released for <i>Quake 2</i> and picks up where the original game left off. While gamers looking for something new will be disappointed with the <i>Reckoning</i>, anyone who loved <i>Quake 2</i> will undoubtedly be into it. <i>The Reckoning</i> boasts 18 new single-player levels and seven new deathmatch levels. Among the <i>Reckoning</i>\'s new enemies, the Repair Bots are easily the most annoying as they have the ability to resurrect dead bad guys who that haven\'t been gibbed. But don\'t worry--your improved arsenal features some excellent tools for dismembering your enemies, like the Phalanx Particle Canon, the Trap, and the Ion Ripper. <i>Reckoning</i>\'s levels are little longer than those in the original game, so expect to invest some serious time.<P> The second mission pack, <i>Ground Zero</i>, sends you back to battle yet another Strogg device of mass destruction. In Quake 2 it was The Big Gun; this time around it\'s the Gravity Well. Like the <i>Reckoning</i>, <i>Ground Zero</i> sports new levels: 14 single-player and 10 deathmatch, as well as weapons and enemies. Easily the raddest power-ups in <i>Ground Zero</i> are the deathmatch-only Vengeance and Hunter Spheres which attack enemies that have killed you and the preeminent room-clearing device the anti-matter bomb.<P> Lastly, <i>Quad Damage</i> includes the Extremities netpack, a collection of 11 of the most popular <i>Quake 2</i> modifications (mods) and a bevy of deathmatch maps and skins. From the Action Quake mod, which aims to give players the feeling that they\'re in a John Woo-style action movie, to the wildly popular Eraser Bot, which gives single gamers a deathmatch-style experience, the netpack is an essential <i>Quake 2</i> component. Gamers with fast Internet connections should know that all of the skins, mods, and maps on the netpack can be downloaded for free off the Internet.']","by

Sierra Sports Viper Racing - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""This car racing simulator features the Dodge Viper modeled in exquisite detail. The game is easy to master yet lets experienced racers work their way up through the racing leagues. It also offers the option to customize your car using the paint kit and upgrade your car's components in the garage."", 'Newcomer Monster Games came up with an interesting concept for Viper Racing: Create the type of ultrarealistic physics model found in games like Grand Prix Legends and use it to simulate racing a high-dollar production car. It might not sound that groundbreaking, but with the exception of 1993\'s Car and Driver, it\'s probably the only game featuring a car like the Dodge Viper that isn\'t 95 percent arcade action and 5 percent realistic racing. <P> So if the box art of a Viper tearing down a speedway led you to believe you were getting a beefed-up Need for Speed III or Test Drive 5, you\'re in for a big surprise. The Viper\'s the only authentic car featured here; the other choices are generic rides called ""sport,"" ""sedan,"" and ""exotic,"" along with a plane tossed in for the hell of it. The graphics work for the cars doesn\'t come close to what you find in Test Drive 5, and the scenery and terrain are merely average compared with the gorgeous background visuals of Need for Speed III. And even when you play the game in arcade mode, you\'ll discover the physics model is considerably more demanding than in pure arcade racers. <P> But it\'s a whole other story if you head into Viper Racing expecting a highly detailed, realistic simulation of one of the world\'s most powerful and alluring automobiles. Though Viper Racing\'s pleasures (perhaps ""rewards"" is a better word) aren\'t discovered quickly or cheaply, some patience and practice will reveal a pulse-quickening game that feels so real at times that knuckles whiten and teeth grind. <P> What makes Viper Racing so immersive is the physics model MGI created for the game. At first, it might seem a little too realistic, as you find yourself constantly fishtailing out of control, sliding off the track into a field, or even rocketing off a cliff. But when you realize what sort of car you\'re driving - a 3400-pound beast with an 8.0-litre V10 capable of generating 450hp - and remember that you can\'t sling it around like a Formula One Racer, you\'ll find yourself staying on the track and gradually becoming more competitive with the aggressive computer-controlled cars. And I do mean aggressive: These guys\'ll bump you off the road and into a river or valley with the sort of precision you\'d expect to see at a Joey Chitwood show. <P> At about the same time, you\'ll also begin to notice just how real the driving experience seems, particularly if you\'ve got a force feedback wheel. As you head through curves, you can feel when you\'re about to lose traction completely and back off the gas to avoid disaster, and even heading down a straightaway you can sense the contours of the road. The sound effects, from engine noise to the squeal of skidding tires, are very good and add subtly yet effectively to the overall driving ambience. Even if you turned the sound off, though, the banging, bumping, and powersliding action is plenty good enough to make you think you\'re screaming down a stretch of highway at 165mph. <P> Quick races can be run against computer opponents, the clock, or your own best performance (""ghost car"") on any of the game\'s eight tracks and in any vehicle, and there are options to set the difficulty level of opponents and the physics model for the cars. Every setup feature in the garage - you can adjust camber, toe-in, bump, anti-roll bar, rebound, springs, ride height, brake bias, wheel lock, spoiler size, and gear ratios - is accessible in a quick race, making it a good way to get a general idea of how you should set up for each track once you start the career mode. <P> I say general idea because the career mode starts you out as an amateur, limiting your adjustments to brake bias and wheel lock. What this means is that how quickly you advance to the next level of competition depends on your driving, not your setup expertise. As you win races and start socking away prize money, you\'ll be able to add performance-enhancing accessories to improve your exhaust, shocks, axles, gearbox, tires - you name somewhere on the Viper you can slap a new part, and it\'s probably in this game. Choices are limited to your class, and by the time you get to GT Class the whole world of upgrades opens up to you. <P> But Viper Racing\'s low price and its lavish attention to modeling the Dodge Viper come at certain costs. Although the computer drivers are good, there are only seven to race against on eight tracks, and those tracks seem strangely barren and devoid of any signs of human life except for nondescript buildings (OK, the castle isn\'t nondescript). The Viper\'s the only car you can drive in career mode (I\'ve got no problem with that), and no matter which of the other cars you choose for a quick race, the other guys will be in - you guessed it - Dodge Vipers. <P> But those are shortcomings, not flaws; when it comes to actual complaints about what\'s in Viper Racing, the biggest one I can come up with is that the sensation of speed is... well, screwy. You know the message on rearview mirrors that says ""Objects are closer than they appear""? Viper Racing should have a similar warning, something like: ""You\'re always going faster than it appears."" As you slide out of control in a curve, you\'ll be wondering why it\'s happening when you\'re only going 60 or 70 - until a quick glance at the speedometer shows you\'re way over 100. This is a purely subjective gripe, of course, and after a while you\'ll undoubtedly develop an innate sense of how fast you\'re going in relation to the track. But it is something that might put impatient gamers off before they get a chance to discover how intense this game can be. <P> Viper Racing sports a full array of multiplayer options (modem, serial, LAN, and TCP/IP for Internet play), but just as with Grand Prix Legends, Sierra has tossed a potentially great multiplayer game on the market with zero support to help owners set up races. Serious racers will find a few Viper Racing leagues to join, but those of us looking for some quick racing without the commitment that goes along with league play are out of luck. Here\'s hoping Viper Racing makes it onto WON or the Internet Gaming Zone soon. <P> Probably the worst thing you can say about Viper Racing is that it\'s pretty limited in its scope - but you could just as easily turn that around and say that the developer focused on a few things so it could make sure they were all done very, very well. All I know is that it sure hooked me. <i>--Stephen Poole</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Command &amp; Conquer Gold Edition - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['If you\'re a strategy fan and don\'t already own a copy of Command & Conquer, you\'ve got it easy when it comes to deciding whether or not to buy the new Gold Edition of the award-winning classic. Because you haven\'t already spent $40 or $50 on the original Command & Conquer, you needn\'t worry whether or you should shell out another $45 or $50 for Windows 95 support, SVGA graphics, head-to-head Internet play, and a Command & Conquer Theme Pack (animated icons, wallpaper, and sound effects); after all, you\'re buying the game, not the extras. So you\'ll buy the Gold Edition and love it - case closed. <P>But what if you\'re one of the hundreds of thousands of users who already own the DOS version of Command & Conquer? Is it really worth $30 or $40 bucks (owners of the DOS version get a $10 rebate) for the enhancements? For gamers uninterested in multiplayer action, the answer is probably ""no."" The new graphics are a big improvement, but they\'re not enough to get you excited about fighting the same single-player battles over again. But if you\'re into multiplayer C&C, it\'s probably worth the investment. <P>Take the SVGA graphics, for instance. It would be easy to dismiss them as eye candy, but the truth is they allow you to see four times as much of the map as in the DOS version - giving you a decided edge when competing against players using the old C&C. And with the addition of Westwood Chat support, C&C fans have another venue for finding opponents and playing tournaments or ladder games. Setting up a game over Westwood Chat is about as easy as Internet gaming gets, and there are always plenty of opponents looking for action. <P>The one complaint many will have with the Gold Edition is price. Westwood has made a ton of money (and justifiably so) off the sales of Command & Conquer; to ask Command & Conquer owners to pay almost full price for an SVGA upgrade, Internet play, and Theme Pack is a bit much. New users will find the investment well worth it, but the company could create a lot more goodwill among their loyal fans by upping that rebate by five or ten bucks, or simply creating an upgrade. Especially when you consider that serious C&C players will consider those SVGA graphics essential for staying competitive in their multiplayer matches.<I>--Stephen Poole</I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Motocross Madness - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""You want lotsa tracks? You got 'em. Be the first rider out of the gate for high-flying, wheelie-riding, off-road motorbike action. Rail ahead of the pack on the indoor Supercross tracks and outdoor Motorcross tracks. Kiss the sky while you catch huge air in a stunt quarry, or test your endurance in rally-style, cross-country terrain racing. It takes balance, brains, and bravado to ride these super-charged bikes. It's all here from speed to stunts--if you can do it on a dirt bike, you can do it in Motorcross Madness."", ""Microsoft seems to be cornering the market on sports requiring that a perfectly good sports arena be filled with mud. First, it releases the surprisingly fun Monster Truck Madness series, and now it follows it up with this motocross simulator. Anyone who's ever seen a commercial for a Super Bowl of motocross will undoubtedly already have a pretty vivid image of the game in his mind: masked cyclists flying through the air at unbelievable heights, waving raised thumbs and legs at the wildly cheering audience, then landing (possibly in a heap) on the dirt track below. And that's pretty much what the game delivers. <P> Which is a compliment. With its multitude of modes and good terrain graphics, this is pretty much everything you could hope for in a motocross simulation, and then some. <P> Motocross Madness is really two games in one. Most of your options are for races - there are national races, supercross races, and the grueling Baja. The first two are typical multilap races in outdoor or indoor arenas. Though the game is by no means a serious sim, the races follow in the tradition of more realistic driving simulations. For instance, you really have little hope of doing well unless you've spent some time memorizing the various tracks. <P> The Baja races are very different. These marathons have you racing many laps through expansive outdoor environments - they aren't so much about speed as endurance. These are quite fun, as they take a great deal of time to complete, and the standings can change dramatically over the course of a single race. <P> In the race modes, understanding motorcycle mechanics comes in handy, as well, and you'll have to adjust shocks, engine, and gears if you want to hit peak performance in the different environments. And while Motocross Madness does provide preset values for these - as well as a number of assists - the only major problem with the game is that it doesn't give beginners any context or help in determining how to tweak the different elements. <P> But where the game really shines is in the stunt quarry. Each of the arenas for this mode is a series of sharp rises and valleys where you compete to successfully perform the most stunts in a predetermined period of time. This mode flaunts Motocross Madness' greatest feature: the excellent physics engine, which has just enough realism to make it believable and just enough exaggeration to make it fun. There's only one minor problem with this mode, which is that the stunts themselves are just a series of preset button combinations, and you gain more or fewer points depending on how long you hold them. It'd be great if there was room for a bit more freestyle action - but there's no denying the thrill of pulling off a few stunts in a single while you're careening through the air over the competition. <P> Add to this some solid graphics (which require a Direct3D-compatible accelerator), and relatively lag-free multiplayer racing over Microsoft's own Internet Gaming Zone, and there really isn't much to complain about. Motocross Madness is, quite simply, a great deal of fun with a lot to offer both the motorcycle racing fan who wants to test his mettle on the Baja and the action fan who just wants to pull some Barneys a few hundred feet in the air. <i>--Ron Dulin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

F-22 Lightning 3 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The bestselling jet combat simulation of 1996 and 1997 is back. <i>F-22 Lightning 3</i> takes modern jet combat to a new level with the fiercest action and most stunning graphics ever conceived. Owners of 3-D cards will be delighted to know that <i>F-22 Lightning 3</i> is scheduled to support an extensive array of 3-D hardware including both Glide and Direct3D technologies. <i>Lightning 3</i> promises electrifying gameplay and innovative enhancements to the most powerful F-22 flight simulator available. Including over 50 new, gripping single-player missions, <i>Lightning 3</i> offers intense online multiplayer combat through NovaWorld. Acclaimed as the leader in large-scale multiplayer gaming, NovaLogic is proud to introduce Voice-Over-Net technology, which allows pilots to talk to each other during the heat of combat.', ""Since the early days of NovaLogic - you know, back when voxels were the size of your fist and hours were wasted trying to squeeze out some extra lower memory to run Comanche - the company has steadily released simulations, typically with a military theme, that are fast, fun, and furious. You didn't expect a lot of realism or even depth in some cases, but what you got was a game you could load, play, and shoot something in, with some nice explosion or other graphical treat as your reward. Despite NovaLogic's attempt to gain legitimacy with official sanctioning from the F-22's manufacturer Lockheed Martin, you still couldn't expect the level of realism of, say, the Falcon series, or sims from Digital Integration, Jane's, or Digital Image Design. So, with that in mind, if you look over NovaLogic's latest offering, F-22 Lightning 3, you are presented with NovaLogic's credo (that is, fast, fun, and furious) front and center, which is really not a bad thing at all. <P> F-22 Lightning III is a fairly straightforward, easy-to-play, simple-to-get-into F-22 flight simulation, featuring good graphics and mission structure, as well as a more pronounced emphasis on fast and furious multiplayer games. You can step up the screen resolution all the way to 1024x768, though 800x600 runs fine for 3dfx owners (recommended, as the HUD is easier to read in the full cockpit mode). Hardware requirements are surprisingly lax - 800x600 on a Voodoo2 is extremely smooth with all the options turned on. Then again the price you pay is the fog, which seems to be too close for comfort, diminishing how far you can see onto the horizon. One nice graphical feature is the variety of weather: snow, thunderstorms, driving rain, and so forth. The lightning is a particularly good effect, not to mention the nuclear explosions (more on those babies later). The aircraft are well detailed and sport a variety of paint schemes. <P> That brings us to gameplay, which is pretty simplified and easy to learn. Many of the controls are standard, borrowing from previous NovaLogic flight sims in more than a few areas. Many extra commands can be accessed directly through various though somewhat unusual key combinations, mostly through the use of the control key. You can customize your controls for the keyboard and joystick to whatever you want. You'll spend most of your time in the HUD or virtual cockpit views, or slewing to the padlock in between. There are external views, including a target view, all of which can be tilted and/or panned, but they are hardly intuitive or action-oriented. Typically everything you need to know is in the HUD, though when the missiles start flying it would be better to switch to the virtual cockpit for a gander at the radar view. Missions are objective- and waypoint-oriented, so you basically fly your route and attempt to accomplish the goal - blowing something up, shooting something down, or trying not to get yourself or your buddies killed. <P> Combat is easy - as soon as you are within range, directional cues and other indicators will tell you what it is and where it's going. All the standard weapon types are here: AMRAAMs, sidewinders, your trusty 20mm Vulcan Gatling gun, HARMs, JDAMs, various types of iron bombs, and everyone's favorite B61 10-kiloton tactical thermonuclear free-fall bomb. Why in the world an F-22 would be carrying one is beyond me, but it's fun to drop the bomb and ride the shock wave. One departure from most F-22 sims is not having to worry about opening the weapon bay doors before releasing your ordnance - all of the F-22's weapons are stored in internal weapon bays - and closing them again after launch to reduce your radar signature. It's all done for you. Heck, you hardly even have to worry about your radar signature. <P> F-22 Lightning 3 has three modes of play: quick missions, campaigns, and multiplayer. The quick missions are not instant action, a feature that was surprisingly left out. Actually the quick missions are a set of training and situational missions, set first in Nevada and then moving overseas. They can be played in any order, but they are arranged in a tutorial-like manner from the beginning, and the complexity rises with each successive mission. There are 22 quick missions, and more can be created via an external mission editor that comes with the game, which is another nifty feature. <P> There are six campaigns, with a total of 46 missions split between them (each campaign features either seven or eight missions, which must be played in order). The campaigns cover various hot spots around the world (Libya, Chad, Indonesia, Syria, the Kola Peninsula, and so forth). Difficulty varies, though the missions aren't nearly as difficult as some in F-22 Lightning II, but the campaigns should be played in the order they appear. Some of the missions can get tricky but not overly head-banging-against-the-wall hard. <P> Then there's multiplayer: Click to enter the NovaWorld.net servers, pick a game, and off you go. Typically there are three game types (more may be introduced later): deathmatch, RAW, and cooperative. Deathmatch is pretty self-explanatory, though the games can be made with full ordnance loads or guns only. In RAW, teams attempt to bomb their enemy's base off the map before the same happens to their own base, while in cooperative games you can participate with up to seven other players in specially built missions (the other game modes support a whopping 128 players). NovaWorld games are typically a blast to play in, and latency is not a big issue - low-speed modems play just as well as cable modems. To make things even more interesting, NovaLogic threw a microphone headset in the box to accommodate its new Voice-Over-Net technology, letting you communicate with each other using voice transmissions while flying. And it works, too. <P> So what does F-22 Lightning 3 have going against it? For one thing the simplicity may turn off some of the more die-hard flight-sim fanatics. NovaLogic also applied the same simplicity to its game manual, a 38-page travesty that is short on explanation and long on nothing in particular. Well, OK, it does devote a significant length to taking off and landing, even in-flight refueling, but what about air combat basics or even flying and aerodynamics? Actually there is an Adobe Acrobat file on the CD-ROM about air combat, but this is the kind of stuff that should have been in the manual. Throw in a couple of other annoying tidbits for good measure, like no instant action, set mission structures with no randomization, and bland view options, and F-22 Lightning 3 ends up not quite all it might have been. <P> Overall, though, NovaLogic has churned out a pretty good flight simulation that does its job well. It's an F-22 flight simulation where you can jump into the cockpit, fly for a minute or two, and hop straight into the action, and it provides a variety of missions and multiplayer options that other sims will find difficult to compete against. <i>--Alan Dunkin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Zork Grand Inquisitor,,['Enhanced DVD-Rom Version for PC'],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>', 'Enhanced DVD-Rom Version for PC']",{},"[""You are a lone adventurer drawn into the Grand Inquisitor's attempt to attack magic, the very fabric of the Great Underground Empire. With a Flathead, a Brogmoid, a Griffin, and the Dungeon Master as your allies, you must retrieve the three enchanted treasures. Spells, maps, and special tools will help you in your quest to return magic to the empire. This fantasy adventure is enhanced with DVD audio-and-video technology. The graphic detail of the Underground environment introduces new characters, landmarks, and intriguing puzzles."", 'In the first of many clever references to its predecessors in the Zork series, Grand Inquisitor opens with a bald foppish dictator banning the use of magic throughout the Great Underground Empire. For gamers who plodded through the rather tedious Return to Zork and oddly humorless Zork Nemesis, the plot device is an obvious metaphor for what has happened to the longest-running series (20 years!) in computer gaming. Zork\'s signature wit and absurdity seemed to have been lost in the jump from text to graphic adventuring. Well, the magic may be gone from the land, but it has not vanished from the game. Grand Inquisitor is the best graphical Zork yet, and one of the most consistently entertaining adventures of the year. <P> Of course, your job is to usurp the technocratic Grand Inquisitor and his repressive anti-magic policies. After a brief visit to Port Foozle, you locate the GUE (Great Underground Empire) and spend much of the game hunting down the three lost artifacts (the Coconut of Quendor, the Skull of Yoruk, and the Cube of Foundation) that will restore magic to Zork. All that remains of last year\'s Nemesis title is the basic gaming interface. Full motion video sequences punctuate your movement among static, prettily drawn settings. The ""Z-Vision"" device is here again, letting you spin 360 degrees in place at various locations for a more involving view of the terrain. Very handy menus of usable objects and magic spells appear at the top of the screen, and a good inventory screen lets you examine and combine the many found objects and learned spells along the way.  <P> While the basic item-gathering and puzzle-solving of Grand Inquisitor is far from innovative, the triumph of the game is its seamless, witty execution. Enemies of the Inquisitor are ""totemized,"" squished and consigned to spend eternity in steel reinforced hockey pucks. One such resistor, a wiseass Dungeon Master, is sealed within a lantern and accompanies you through much of the journey. He blurts asides to most of your unsuccessful actions: ""Ooh! That\'s gotta hurt."" And these snide characterizations form the real charm of the game. A two-headed Cerebus blocks you at Hell\'s door, mocking your standard attempts to get by. ""Go ahead, dig into the old inventory. Something\'s gotta work!"" A pair of talking torches, one grumpy and the other neurotic, refuses to be picked up or to work properly in certain situations. Thankfully, and unlike most ""humorous"" computer adventures, the scripting is genuinely funny and well acted. The old television actors\' homes got emptied out for this one, but to very good effect. Dirk Benedict (A-Team, Battlestar Galactica) plays a TV action hero whose brio gets him into scrapes with the Inquisitor, which we follow in cutscenes throughout. Michael McKean of SNL, Spinal Tap, and Laverne and Shirley (Lenny) plays the DM with just the right amount of irony. Squiggy (David Lander) does a short cameo as the voice of a torch as well. Real old-timers like Marty Ingels and Rip Taylor take their comic turns as well in a nicely cast, well-written game that keeps the puzzle-solving light and fun. <P> The puzzles themselves are familiar Zorkisms. How do you retrieve the Coconut of Quendor from the soft palate of that sleeping dragon with some combination of inflatable toys, a gold tooth, and a bicycle pump? What exactly is the use of a magic spell that makes the color purple invisible? Of course, you will need to figure out how to make the Totemizer machine work in your favor and decipher a cryptic map of prison cells in order to free poor Dirk Benedict - the usual reverse engineering tasks of the computer adventurer. They are not tiresome or gratuitous, however. Grand Inquisitor succeeds in keeping the obstacles solvable and sensible (in a Zorky kind of way) within the fictional world.  <P> The weaknesses are few and forgivable. The game world feels too small and short-lived. Much of the hunting and gathering involves fewer than a dozen major areas, like the GUE University, the Dungeon Master\'s house, and the Monastery. Brief hops into Hades and Port Foozle are fun too, but I wished for greater vistas to explore. It all ends in about 15 hours of playtime. And the only irritating part of the gameplay comes from the Z-Vision spinning panorama. The cursor changes to a directional pointer when you face a new open area to explore, but some of these places are so close together that you can overlook an essential little niche too easily. You should scan the entire screen carefully and look for changes in the cursor that indicate smaller nooks or different viewing angles on the same scene. Finally, there is a beta version of a linked, two-player mode, via Net or modem. The second player is purported to take a kibitzing role, merely pointing to areas or items that the main adventurer might try. While I got the Java-based add-on to connect easily enough to the Net, there wasn\'t a playmate to be found there, and probably for good reason. Just on the face of it, this feels like a silly stab at the mutliplayer craze.  <P> Compact and unspectacular as it is, Zork: Grand Inquisitor is a model of adventure gaming as good entertainment. Many of the genre\'s conventions (FMV, item hunting, absurdist humor) get polished to a high sheen here. It is funny and reflexive without being geeky or pointlessly ironic. The third-string actors exploit their comic trademarks to good effect. Real attention is paid to the pacing of the whole affair, so there are no overly quiet dead zones of tedious activity. And the puzzles are fun to solve rather than gratuitous brain-teasing exercises.  <P> All in all, you are made to feel a part of a playful jaunt through a silly world. Truly, the lads and lasses at Activision have succeeded in restoring the magic to Zork, and in doing so have provided us with a good baseline for measuring competent design in the genre. <I>--Steve Smith</I> <BR><I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

FIFA 2000 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Soccer has never been very popular in the United States, if only because its 45-minute halves of continuous action are unlike the frequent start-stop dynamic of pro football, baseball, and basketball. Throw in the typically low score of a soccer match, and it isn\'t difficult to understand the general lack of interest in the game. That being the case, computer and video soccer games have traditionally been designed for foreign markets and later released in the US in hopes of making some additional sales.

It also contains three levels of play: amateur, pro, and world class. There is a big difference in the computer\'s skill level between the three settings, most noticeably in the speed of the opposing players. Great weaving runs will win matches for you in the amateur level but will become obsolete at the pro level in which short, crisp passing becomes the order of the day. The training area is a good place to try to adjust to the different speed of the players at the higher levels. In addition, you can practice various set pieces, such as penalty kicks, throw-ins, and free kicks. <P> Exhibition mode lets you match one team against another, and with teams available from such soccer-loving countries as England, Scotland, Germany, and Italy, plus classic teams from the past and a large number of international squads, the exhibition mode is almost a game in and of itself. However, the tournament mode offers more variety. Single-elimination tournaments are rare in US sports, and yet they generate huge excitement throughout the rest of the world. FIFA 2000\'s tournament mode lets you make a custom single-elimination tournament of the teams you want. I particularly enjoyed matching up the lesser English Premiership teams with teams from Scotland and Major League Soccer. But different combinations of teams from any of the available leagues can be put together. In addition, there is a custom league option that allows complete mixing and matching. For example, I took the teams from Scotland and Sweden and put them in a 22-team league, but I was disappointed that the game ended after one season. <P> The regular season mode lets you take a single team through the entire season of competition. For instance, if you\'re playing a great team from England, then you play not only league games, but also domestic and European cup competitions. Of further note, FIFA 2000 includes various classic teams, such as the 1968 Manchester United European Cup winners and the brilliant early-\'70s Ajax squad. EA made a curious aesthetic decision to use a brown-colored tint when two of the old-time teams play, as if to re-create the look of a grainy old film reel. But this effect merely interferes with the gameplay - specifically the appearance of the pass direction arrow, which is in all other cases unobtrusively color-coded - and it should have been an option rather than the default. <P> Once you get into the game, it\'s high-octane sports action at its finest. The motion-captured animation is superb overall and completely captures the essence of movement in soccer. Great crowd animations and stadium chants also add to the atmosphere. The varied heights of the players, their realistic facial expressions, and even their hairstyles all make you believe you\'re actually watching your favorite team. <P> FIFA 2000 not only looks good, but it also plays well. For instance, the controls are very responsive. You can perform a variety of kicks, tackles, and headers with various button presses and combinations. As you move with the ball, the pass direction arrow clearly points toward offscreen players and indicates the chances of the ball getting through to them. However, EA Sports could have improved FIFA 2000\'s player-management and simulation aspects. While it is possible to move players between teams, there are no filters to prevent lopsided moves. Each team has a certain amount of money, so you can\'t buy all the players you want, although it is still possible to pick up an entire team of good players. It would be nice to see an active intelligent trade market and managers making deals based on need. FIFA 2000 lets you play up to three seasons in a league, but without this active trading there is really no point, since the same teams remain powerful. This may be why the customizable league stops after one season - but it would be nice to have active trading and leagues that could continue year after year. <P> EA Sports brought on MLS commentator Julie ""Rowdy"" Foudy of the United States Woman\'s World Cup team to provide the color commentary along with ESPN\'s Phil Schoen. While FIFA fans have become familiar with the commentary style of respected English commentator John Motson, Foudy is pleasant enough, although it is disorienting to hear her talk about tackles on a football field (meaning American football) within the context of a soccer game. <P> While there is some room for improvement, FIFA 2000 delivers on almost every front and is a fast-paced, enjoyable, and challenging soccer game with numerous options and lots of depth. Though you may find yourself wishing FIFA 2000 offered even more, it is ultimately a must for any soccer fan.<I>--Colin Sloan</I> <P> --<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Worms: Armageddon,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"['Do you ever wonder what all of those worms squirming around subterranean  tunnels are scheming? We do, too. As it turns out, according to <I>Worms  Armageddon</I>, our wacky segmented friends have a stockpile of crazy weapons and  are waging a war big enough to turn the world into a heaping compost pile. Who  knew?', '<I>Worms Armageddon</I> brings the humorously addictive gameplay of the very  popular <i>Worms</i> series to the Dreamcast for the first time. The strategy-based  gameplay is as unique as the premise. Commanding a team of worms, players wriggle  and shoot through 30 missions and 14 training levels. Players take turns moving a worm  warrior into position and then firing at the opposing team, using an arsenal of weapons  ranging from mines and kamikaze attacks to the more traditional exploding sheep attack  and banana bombs. Naturally, the commander who best combines strategic moves with  creative attacks wins the worm war.', ""Join the throngs of fans of this unique game series and you'll never look at a grinning,  gun-toting earthworm in the same way again. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", 'Do you ever wonder what worms do in their free time? The third chapter of the popular Worms series, Worms Armageddon, has you believe that instead of just hiding under rocks and floating down storm drains, worms are actually ruthlessly militant creatures with boyish British accents. This simple, somewhat innocent premise sets the stage for an excellent turn-based strategy game, as Worms Armageddon is not only the best Worms game, it\'s also an incredible multiplayer experience. The concept is pretty simple: You control a team of well-armed worms, and your objective is to kill the other worms any way you can. You do this on a 2D plane that\'s usually a series of odd platforms and objects precariously placed over deadly water. The combat itself takes place in a series of timed turn-based rounds that seamlessly flow into each other. Each of your worms shares a collective arsenal from which you can choose all sorts of weapons - from the devastatingly serious to the laughably wacky. From there, you switch to a manual aiming and firing scheme used to unleash your weapon of choice at the worm you\'re targeting. This leads to all sorts of havoc, as combat tends to lend itself to poorly aimed explosives and the fun effects they cause. The worms and everything around them have a distinctly animated look to them. Big eyes and oddly shaped household items show the comic-strip influence of the graphics, and combined with the simple 2D layout, it makes Worms Armageddon something of a throwback to simpler times. The detail is simple but effective, and it helps support the humorous themes running through the game\'s elements. Switching to more offbeat weapons will generally change your character\'s appearance - a worm will don a headband before administering a dragon-punch, and a worm armed with a battle-ax is also outfitted with a Viking helmet. Explosions and animations are simple - worms shuffle along when you\'re moving them, and explosives blow up within a pretty obvious radius. Still, more detail to some animations, such as the shotgun fire, could have provided Worms with a bit more graphical prowess and, in turn, could have helped sort out exactly where the blast hit (or missed). Apparently, all worms come from Europe somewhere and have a definite lack of testosterone in their voices. Squeaky, high-pitched speech fills the game with colorful comments from your worm army as you play. If a live grenade is tossed next to you, your worm will scream, ""Run for it."" If it completely misses, your worm will ask, ""What was that?"" This effect is only mildly cute and strictly tiptoes the fine line of being annoying. Other sound effects - such as explosions, bouncing grenades, and submachine gun fire - are done well and lend a bit of realism to an otherwise unrealistic experience. Mild, almost unnoticeable music plays in the background and helps you focus on the task at hand. The only particularly bad thing about the audio is the German beer commercial-like Euro-dance that pulses over the title screen. Still, a few button presses, and this is all but forgotten. It\'s the weapons in this game that make it really fun. Every combat game may have grenades and shotguns, but not a whole lot of them have pneumatic drills, ninja ropes, supersheep, and sticks of dynamite. This huge assortment of instruments used to deal out the pain keeps things fairly fresh and funny, as each weapon has its own silly effect. Still, there are some weapons that are just too powerful, and once you\'ve mastered them, they have a countereffect on the gameplay. On top of that, instead of switching off between worms, the turn system switches off between teams - meaning a team with a single worm will get four turns before four worm on one team goes once. This makes it unduly difficult to kill the last worm on a team, as he easily gets a tactical advantage with his multiple turns. It\'s terribly frustrating to be killed before you can even get a shot off. Multiplayer is where this game is at. With the Dreamcast&#x92;s multiple controller ports, you can easily go at it with up to three friends. And because most players can think pretty quickly, the multiplayer gameplay quickly turns into a barrage of havoc, with grenades and bazooka rounds flying all over the place. The easy-to-pick-up gameplay makes this a great party game, and the ensuing hilarity from the calamity that is bound to happen makes this a game everyone can laugh at. Unfortunately, the single-player game just isn\'t as good. The computer has eagle-eye accuracy, and down to its last worm it is capable of factoring in wind, trajectory, and ricochet, so it can place that one deadly bazooka shell halfway across a level, through a series of ledges, and right on top of your worm. This makes it all the more frustrating to play against the computer, as it seems to almost cheat. Still, the AI is capable of doing some pretty lame things itself, such as bouncing a grenade back to its sender or shooting the floor out from under itself. But the AI definitely favors certain weapons - the bazooka, grenades, shotgun, and mines are all high on the AI\'s list of weapons of choice, while the dragon punch, the battle-ax, or the Uzi are almost never wielded by the computer-controlled worms. Unfortunately, even with the Dreamcast\'s ""it\'s thinking"" hardware, the computer still tends to take an extremely long time plotting exactly how it\'s going to attack your troops, and, as such, you spend a lot of the single-player game just waiting for a worm to make its move.  Worms Armageddon is designed so you can play with other people, and the single-player match is really no substitute. If you\'ve got plenty of friends who spend their time lounging around your place, definitely pick this one up for some rewarding gameplay and good laughs. Although the game has its weak points, the solid gameplay and simple control make this game a must-have for anyone who likes to play games with other humans.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Microsoft Return of Arcade - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Relive those carefree and exciting days when every quarter burned a hole in your pocket. Return of Arcade puts you in command of four hot arcade classics --- replicated exactly for the PC!', 'Hark back to 1982. Of course, that may be a pre-embryonic hark for many gamers, but bear with me. This was the apex of the video arcade\'s golden age. Back then arcade aficionados piled quarters on popular machines to ""hold"" their station. Parents urged boycotts and feared for a lost generation. Lines of eager gamers snaked out from popular titles. And those titles invariably included the four games in Microsoft\'s Return of Arcade: Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Pole Position, and Galaxian. <P> Back then, computers simply could not compete with arcade machines\' dedicated audio and video processors. My Apple II+ versions of Galaxian and Pac-Man paled in comparison to the ""real"" things. The allure of the arcade was overwhelming. <P> Today, you can experience that golden age of arcades at home. Microsoft has done an excellent job re-engineering these games to run in Windows 95. Its programmers worked closely with Namco, the games\' designer and still one of the top arcade game makers in the world. Microsoft could have beefed up the sound and graphics but remained faithful to original, albeit weak, eight-bit audio and 16 colors. Not a detail seems to have been forgotten, not even the built-in, but known-only-to-insiders playing tricks. <P> For those who don\'t know, Galaxian came out in 1979 and is a back-and-forth scrolling space shooter. Pac-Man hit the arcades in 1980 and became the most popular arcade game ever. The allure of a little pizza face gobbling ghosts appealed to all ages and both sexes. And Pole Position, a simple auto racing sim, and Dig Dug, a nearly indescribable, underground, demon quest, were both released in 1982. <P> So are these old games worth your time and money? For nostalgia buffs, the answer\'s a definite yes, though you will miss the feel of the arcade controller. Keyboard controls, especially for Pole Position, just don\'t cut it. A joystick is a must and it\'s still not the real thing. <P> For those not raised on these games the answer is a qualified yes. They offer hours of wonderfully retro distraction but lack the visceral feel and rich depth of today\'s games. <P> Hmm. I catch the scent of a new, old trend: simple, readily accessible games, offering brief, coffee-break-length entertainment. And this time, you don\'t have to leave your office to enjoy them. <i>--Jeff Sengstack</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

And besides, they weren't really interested in eating you anyway - they were just after your crystals. <P>Rock Raiders is one of two games being released for the console by Lego Media (the other is Lego Racers), and it's a 3D action game with some resource management involved. In the seven-minute intro, you're introduced to a spaceship full of Lego men who don't talk so much as make recognizable grunts, moans, and squeals so that people from all parts of the world can understand them. In any case, their ship gets sucked into a black hole and spat out in another galaxy, and they must land on a planet and drill for ore and crystals so that they'll have enough energy to get back home. <P>You begin by teleporting a bunch of Lego guys down to the mines on the unknown planet and ordering them to drill. The goal is to gather enough crystals and ore to get you home. As mentioned, no one dies in the Lego world, and there are some monsters. When a Lego guy gets too weak, he's teleported back to the ship for recuperation. The PC version of this game is very much about resource management, but the PlayStation version, in addition to having some resource management elements also has a more arcade-y feel and more adventurous missions. Monsters include the rock monsters, ice monsters (who pick up Lego guys and squeeze them), slugs who slime up the walkways, and so on. Mostly, the monsters want your crystals because that's their food, and they'll wreck your nice compound to get it.  But they won't eat you. <P>You'll have a number of vehicles to play with, including a helicopter and a ground vehicle with a big drill. You'll confront lava, water, monsters, and thick walls, but there won't be any unexpected mine collapses to kill you - although some of the missions may include rescuing comrades trapped in a mineshaft somewhere. Weapons you'll have include the push gun (which pushes monsters away), the freeze gun, the laser, the teleporter gun, and dynamite. We're not sure right now if you can use your big drill to drill into monsters, but it sure is a good idea. <P>Rock Raiders is supposed to launch at the same time the new Lego set does - October of this year.

Carmageddon - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The popular (and slightly notorious) racing game with a twist. Like the old movie Death Race 2000, Carmageddon allows the drivers to accumulate points not merely by skill shown on one of the 36 race tracks, but by the amount (and type) of pedestrians the driver is able to run over while racing.', '""Members of the public, you now have one minute to reach Minimum Safe Distance."" Truly, that\'s one of the greatest opening lines of dialogue ever recorded for a racing game.', 'Carmageddon touches that particular collective nerve that fuses the wholesome popularity of the All-American Racing Game with the homicidal singularity of the 70s cult film [<a href=""http://www.mcn.net/~netrencher/dr2k.html"">Death Race 2000</a>] into an onscreen experience that can only be compared to the kind of automotive mayhem that a five-year-old American male wreaks with his Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars.', ""The object: Win the race. The motive: Greed. The Rules: None whatsoever. Clear all the specified race checkpoints, destroy all the opposing racecars, or vehicularly murder every last pedestrian bystander within a three-mile radius. It doesn't matter; nobody cares... with the possible minor exception of the pedestrians."", ""Carmageddon uses a ranking system wherein players start at number 99 and move up, painfully and violently, in rank via a series of six-car races through more than 36 circuits - through the circuits, under them, and in some cases quite a considerable number of feet over them. The game is playable as a cockpit-view racer, but the third-person, follow-cam view is a vastly better way to witness the action, which ranges from the dead-on realistic to the absolutely ridiculous and back again without warning. From the go-flag, the competing cars are at each other (1,000 bonus points to whomever manages to cream the flag-waver on the way out), and for the first few moments the gameplay is usually little more than a dense column of outlandishly-designed 3-D vehicles (hopped-up hearses, low-rider Carz That Go Boom, banana-yellow stylized vehicular sharks, and nitro-burnin' dragsters, in addition to some 20 other types) all clashing and sparking and shrieking for pole position (the designers obviously channeled a lot of time into finding really unpleasant, metallic scraping sounds, some of which will put the sensitive gamer's teeth on edge with barely-formed thoughts of the dentist). Every car here can hit the century mark within a few seconds off the line, and the problems begin immediately."", 'Usually it\'s something like this: One car will break away to one side (either accidentally or with lots of help), begin to slip into a screaming spin, and instantly trigger a chain-reaction meta-collision involving every car on the road, most of the nearby pedestrians and possibly even some of the local livestock - and if nobody takes the hint, you can start the festivities yourself by love-tapping your lane neighbor, cranking the steering wheel or jamming on the brakes for no good reason. The result is berserk, absurd, epic, and comical at the same time - bright, candy-colored racecars sliding into walls, colliding with dense, metallic crunches, pinwheeling up icy slopes, spiraling through the air like two-ton footballs, plowing red swaths through clusters of screaming pedestrians, obliterating cows, plummeting off the sides of bridges, landing on top of each other and getting points for all of it (including cunning stunt and self-explanatory piledriver bonuses). You also never know if some joker held off on the accelerator and hung back there until he could get a good, well-timed ram at whomever may have survived the opening debacle in the most vulnerable condition - it\'s like an evening with the entirety of the [<a href=""http://www.wwf.com"">World Wrestling Federation</a>], only without the same sense of personal safety and moral depth. And this is almost always before you\'ve cleared the first checkpoint. Sometimes you won\'t even ever see the first checkpoint.', 'Of course, once you\'ve escaped this messy opening, you can race against the clock to complete the circuit (picking up the odd extra few seconds here and there by picking off an old lady crossing the street), or you can concentrate on turning around, finding the rest of the competitors and destroying them. There are no ranged weapons here (with the exception of an anti-pedestrian ray gun power-up); all the combat is purely kinetic, and what promised to start as an honest race can degenerate into a series of jousts at 150 mph. Interplay claims that the ""vehicles display accurate driving physics and realistic collision damage,"" and this is partly true - cars can do sideslips, bootleggers, J-turns, etc. - but what they don\'t tell you is that this realism only holds true at speeds of less that 20 game-miles-per-hour; beyond that, the collisions are catastrophic, the results ludicrous, with vehicles slamming off sloped terrain (or other cars) and flying for the game equivalent of a quarter of a mile. And, of course, there are bonus points for especially wild stunts, intended or not. The impacts, too, are beyond human or vehicular endurance. No matter - the point is, it\'s fun.', ""The points you earn translate immediately to money, which can be used for on-the-fly (sometimes literally) repairs. Nobody cares how far in debt you go, as long as you come out with a positive bank balance when the dust settles and the blood dries. And again, fun is the point here - if you're not having fun in Carmageddon, it's your own fault. Drivers can go off-road, explore underground caverns and quite a bit of the local airspace, short-cut, cheat, lay in ambush, trawl for power-ups (some useful, like time-adds, and some just plain silly, like the dreaded pinball mode), go human-hunting or even - if the mood strikes them - try to win the race the right way, by completing the circuit in record time."", ""Even those with very fast systems will be astonished at the load time for each track - upwards of thirty seconds, even with a medium install (alas, it's not even an interesting thirty seconds, just the same, static image that will likely become one of the biggest gripes for players). Also, the handling differences between cars often come down to issues of key-lag more than anything else. But this is not a racing sim by any stretch of the imagination. If you can keep that in mind, you shouldn't be disappointed. Carmageddon is visceral, violent, vehicular fun, no strings attached, no artificial morals or ethics added, and no artificial colors - just black, blue, and red all over. <i>--Chris Hudak</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Atomic Bomberman - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['I play console games. That\'s right. I\'ve said it. Despite having been a PC reviewer for seven years, I do occasionally sneak over to a console machine just to take a peek at how the other half lives. And, usually, I\'m not impressed. The one glaring exception would have to be HudsonSoft\'s release of Super Bomberman 2 for the Super Nintendo. Throughout the years, this one simple game has been the pinnacle of what all games should aspire to be - simple to learn, requiring very little in the way of flashy graphics or spectacular sound, and delivering great gameplay and multiplayer competition. I was overwhelmed with excitement when I first heard that a PC version was on its way. Sadly, though, the game just didn\'t live up to my expectations. <P> Like its console predecessors, Interplay\'s Atomic Bomberman is pleasingly simple. You control one of several different colored bombers from an overhead perspective. By clicking your button (the game can be fully customized so this can be any button that suits you) you drop lit bombs that explode after a few seconds. Using these bombs, you must destroy all of your opponents. That\'s it (well, there\'s a little more to it, but that\'s basically it). By collecting icons that are hidden within the walls you can arm your bomber with power-ups, such as additional bombs, more powerful bombs, acceleration, the ability to kick bombs (good for getting out of a tight pinch), and the ability to throw bombs. All in all, if you are a new player you can expect to spend at most five minutes learning how to play. But as you play you\'ll learn tricks and acquire skills that will improve your game. <P> So here\'s the tricky part. The game is actually so simple that most PC users would look at it and say ""shareware"" without ever taking the time to actually play it. Interplay\'s solution to this potential problem was to send in their design teams to add a load of new features and artwork that would enhance the game without losing its overall feel. Unfortunately, they were only partially successful. Some of the game\'s new features are great, such as the addition of hilarious death animations and a bunch of new maps. Others are horrible, like the new icon art and the megs and megs of ""taunts"" that play every time you pick up a power-up. And some are just plain inexplicable, like the inclusion of the golden bomber feature in the single-player mode, but not in the multiplayer mode for which it was designed. But even these changes don\'t really hurt the game - the real coup de grace comes in the poor network support. <P> That\'s right. The most important component of Atomic Bomberman - multiplayer - is also its weakest component. At best, play is jerky and at worst, players get randomly kicked out. There are also really bizarre problems, like adding players who aren\'t really in the game, and awarding wins to players who haven\'t earned them (and not registering those ghost wins on other players\' computers). For a game that revolves around multiplayer competition, this just isn\'t acceptable. <P> On a positive note, Interplay has made some real jumps forward with the game by adding customizable characters, game rules, and more. But Atomic Bomberman is one of this year\'s biggest missed opportunities: PC owners had a chance to not only get introduced to HudsonSoft\'s classic, but to play a title superior to any that had come before it. Sadly, that isn\'t what happened. <i>--Trent C. Ward</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

G Police 2,,['Factory Sealed'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Factory Sealed', ""Among 1997's crop of Psygnosis games, two stood out from the pack, due to their unique futuristic design and intriguing gameplay: Colony Wars and G-Police. Since Psygnosis released a much-improved sequel to Colony Wars, the next logical step was a sequel to G-Police. While the newest incarnation of G-Police is a better game than the original, it still suffers from some all-too-familiar problems. The storyline picks up where the first game left off. After an all-out war with the crime syndicate, the G-Police's forces are thin and unable to cope with the new gang presence on their planet. To help out, Earth sends a huge detachment of Marines to assist the Gs. From there, things quickly spin out of control as the maniacal leader of the Marine force tries to usurp control of the planet itself. It's your task to patrol the various domes of Callisto and deal with any gang activities or other threatening scenarios as they develop. To accomplish this, you'll take control of four different vehicles - your standard VTOL, a beefed-up VTOL with better firepower and space-faring capabilities, a bipedal mech that can jump 500 feet in the air, and an armored troop-transport. This game's biggest problem is its graphics. While you're certainly in a huge environment, the PlayStation's hardware simply cannot handle the number of polygons required, and pop-up makes a gigantic presence. The game tries to overcome this problem with a fairly creative solution - buildings appear as wire-frames until you're close enough to see textures. Unfortunately, this means that you'll never quite know what you're approaching until you're right on top of it. I cannot stress how frustrating it is to approach a building and get pelted by plasma cannons before you can even see what's firing at you. Aside from the horrendous pop-up, the graphics are acceptable and still very much in the same style as Colony Wars. The sound is actually very well done. Every piece of text in the game is spoken to you, giving you the sense that your wingman is actually about to buy the farm when she buzzes over your com channel. Explosions and weapons all have their own distinct sounds, and the music is generally decent. This game also suffers in the control department. If the VTOLs in this game determined current-day air superiority, we'd have some sad, sad statistics. Simply put, the craft are slow, unresponsive, and almost completely unmaneuverable. Like helicopters or any multidirectional thrust craft, your craft can move independently on five different axes. However, while you can increase your altitude by hovering, you cannot decrease it. So, in practice, you can easily move forward while climbing, but to land you must nose-dive and pull up at the last second. This only adds to the general feeling of frustration and takes all the strategy out of the dogfights in the game. You'll just hover in one spot and pivot around until you get the enemy craft in your sights. G Police 2 makes few improvements over the original and never really overcomes the issues that plagued its predecessor. While the action is somewhat better, and the missions have a slightly increased sense of variety, the game is still rather boring. You'll find that the domes are unnecessarily restrictive and that the buildings on Callisto all look the same - leading you to look at your radar more than at the environment around you. I find it somewhat funny that the final mission takes you off Callisto itself and into a huge space battle with the Marine battle cruisers. This is far and away the best mission of the bunch, and it demonstrates that if you were looking for a futuristic air-combat game, you'd be better off with Colony Wars.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Worms Armageddon,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Do you ever wonder what all of those worms squirming around subterranean  tunnels are scheming? We do, too. As it turns out, according to <i>Worms  Armageddon</i>, our wacky segmented friends have a stockpile of crazy weapons and  are waging a war big enough to turn the world into a heaping compost pile. Who  knew?', '<i>Worms Armageddon</i> brings the humorously addictive gameplay of the very  popular <i>Worms</i> series to the PlayStation for the first time. The strategy-based  gameplay is as unique as the premise. Commanding a team of worms, players wriggle  and shoot through 30 missions and 14 training levels. Players take turns moving a worm  warrior into position and then firing at the opposing team, using an arsenal of weapons  ranging from mines and kamikaze attacks to the more traditional exploding sheep attack  and banana bombs. Naturally, the commander who best combines strategic moves with  creative attacks wins the worm war.', ""Join the throngs of fans of this unique game series and you'll never look at a grinning,  gun-toting earthworm in the same way again. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", 'Do you ever wonder what worms do in their free time? The third chapter of the popular Worms series, Worms Armageddon, has you believe that instead of just hiding under rocks and floating down storm drains, worms are actually ruthless militant creatures with boyish British accents that constantly fight each other. This simple, somewhat innocent premise sets the stage for an excellent turn-based strategy game, as Worms Armageddon is not only the best Worms game, it\'s also an incredible multiplayer experience. The concept is pretty simple: You control a team of well-armed worms, and your objective is to kill the other worms any way you can. You do this on a 2D plane that\'s usually a series of odd platforms and objects precariously placed over deadly water. (Worms can\'t swim.) The combat itself takes place in a series of timed turn-based rounds that seamlessly flow into each other. Each of your worms shares a collective arsenal from which you can choose all sorts of weapons - from the devastatingly serious to the laughably wacky. From there, you switch to a manual aiming and firing scheme used to unleash your weapon of choice at the worm you\'re targeting. This leads to all sorts of havoc, as combat tends to lend itself to poorly aimed explosives and the fun effects they cause. The worms and everything around them have a distinctly animated look to them. Big eyes and oddly shaped household items show the comic-strip influence of the graphics, and combined with the simple 2D layout, it makes Worms Armageddon something of a throwback to the old school. The detail is simple but effective, and it helps support the humorous themes running through the game\'s elements. Switching to more offbeat weapons will generally change your character\'s appearance - a worm will don a headband before administering a dragon-punch, and a worm armed with a battle-ax is also outfitted with a Viking helmet. Explosions and animations are simple - worms shuffle along when you\'re moving them, and explosives blow up within a pretty obvious radius. Still, more detail to some animations, such as the shotgun fire, could have provided Worms with a bit more graphical prowess and, in turn, could have helped sort out exactly where the blast hit (or missed). Apparently, all worms come from Europe somewhere and have a definite lack of testosterone in their voices. Squeaky, high-pitched speech fills the game with colorful comments from your worm army as you play. If a live grenade is tossed next to you, your worm will scream, ""Run for it."" If it completely misses, your worm will ask, ""What was that?"" This effect is only mildly cute and strictly tiptoes the fine line of being annoying. Other sound effects - such as explosions, bouncing grenades, and submachine gun fire - are done well and lend a bit of realism to an otherwise unrealistic experience. Mild, almost unnoticeable music plays in the background and helps you  focus on the task at hand. The only particularly bad thing about the audio is the German beer commercial-like Euro-dance that pulses over the title screen. Still, a few button presses, and this is all but forgotten. It\'s the weapons in this game that make it really fun. Every combat game may have grenades and shotguns, but not a whole lot of them have pneumatic drills, ninja ropes, supersheep, and sticks of dynamite. This huge assortment of instruments used to deal out the pain keeps things fairly fresh and funny, as each weapon has its own silly effect. Still, there are some weapons that are just too powerful, and once you\'ve mastered them, they have a countereffect on the gameplay. On top of that, instead of switching off between worms, the turn system switches off between teams - meaning a team with a single worm will get four turns before four worm on one team goes once. This makes it unduly difficult to kill the last worm on a team, as he easily gets a tactical advantage with his multiple turns. It\'s terribly frustrating to be killed before you can even get a shot off. Multiplayer is where this game is at. You can go at it with up to three friends, and you don\'t even need a multitap. The turned-based combat makes controller-passing feasible, and a generous time limit lets even the most thorough planners establish exactly what they want to do before they make their move. The easy-to-pick-up gameplay makes this a great party game, and the ensuing hilarity from the calamity that is bound to happen makes this a game everyone can laugh at. Unfortunately, the single-player game just isn\'t as good. The computer still has eagle-eye accuracy, and down to its last worm it is capable of factoring in wind, trajectory, and ricochet, so you can place that one deadly bazooka shell halfway across a level, through a series of ledges, and right on top of your worm. This makes it all the more frustrating to play against the computer, as it seems to almost cheat. Still, the AI is capable of doing some pretty lame things itself, such as bouncing a grenade back to its sender or shooting the floor out from under itself. But the AI definitely favors certain weapons - the bazooka, grenades, shotgun, and mines are all high on the AI\'s list of weapons of choice, while the dragon punch, the battle-ax, or the Uzi are almost never wielded by the computer-controlled worms. Also, the computer tends to take an extremely long time plotting exactly how it\'s going to attack your troops, and, as such, you spend a lot of the single-player game just waiting for a worm to make its move.  Worms Armageddon is designed so you can play with other people, and the single-player match is really no substitute. If you\'ve got plenty of friends who spend their time lounging around your place, definitely pick this one up for some rewarding gameplay and good laughs. Although the game has its weak points, the solid gameplay and simple control make this game a must-have for anyone who likes to play games with other humans.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

While the sound is good, offering the satisfying crunch of a break and the warm, woody resonance of the felt on a bank shot, there really isn't much going on - certainly no more than you'd expect from a game of pool. The theme music for each of the game's 15 distinct halls lends everything from backwoods boogie to futuristic techno to enhance the mood or dampen it, depending on your taste."", ""Most importantly, the physics are highly realistic. Fine-tuning allows for minute variance in cue stick angle, butt angle, English, and stick speed, all with clockwork accuracy. Of course, this is a simulation, and that level of detail doesn't come without a price. In the real world, you could adjust these parameters simultaneously, in an instant. When you break a shot out into its multiple variables, as you would need to in any simulation, some time is involved and some interface issues arise as you adjust each one."", ""The gamepad or keyboard controls are probably your best bet with Ultimate 8 Ball. Individual parameters are adjusted with the D-pad (or arrows if using a keyboard), while the parameter itself is selected by holding its designated key. The default shot-tweaking speed is incredibly fast, so it's impossible to adjust most parameters without also holding the fine-tuning button, making each adjustment essentially a three-button operation. Unfortunately, when you are lining up your actual shot (where you want the cue ball to go), control is extremely sluggish - it takes forever to rotate the entire table 360-degrees. Though you can switch to an overhead view to speed up the process of finding your shot, there's no way to speed the actual rotation. This makes using a keyboard or gamepad quite frustrating."", ""The mouse doesn't have this problem, as its analog nature lets you rotate your shot 360-degrees in an instant. The rest of the mouse interface is more unwieldy, though. Mouse control is accomplished using an awkward system of clicking and holding icons that live at the bottom of the screen (representing the various control parameters) while using the mouse to move an independent cursor on the ball. It's disorienting and feels less natural than the gamepad's more intuitive control. With any controller, you're stuck holding down the fine-tuning key if you want anything that approximates accuracy. Though the mouse does allow for analog control of cue stick speed when it's time to shoot, it's not worth the hassle of grappling with all those icons."", 'The game has its own strange logic when it comes to its many options. Many of them are earned rather than given. Of the 16 opponents and ten environments, only four of each are available initially. You have to beat the weaker opponents in hustle mode to unlock the real sharks. Winning will also unlock hexagonal tables, tables with dog legs, and more. Fourteen different pool variations are there right from the start though, including eight ball, nine ball, and straight pool, plus some weird ones like tenpin, where each rack of balls is scored like a single frame of bowling.', ""Any pool game worth its felt is going to have some instructional component. Ultimate 8 Ball has a solid one, rendered using the game's own graphics engine rather than pawning it off to FMV. The tutorial offers a linear series of shots, which can be played in any sequence. Shots range from the basics to some real geometrical mind benders. Here the game's interface works well. For each shot you're given a choice of reading a description, watching a 3D-rendered instructor take the shot, or taking the shot yourself. You may do any of these as many times as you like. Gradually, concepts like English, positional cutting, and draw shots are introduced. The only real drawback to the tutorial is that, when watching the instructor shoot, everything happens so fast that it's difficult to absorb the interplay of angles, especially when dealing with complex shots involving multiple banks."", ""Ultimate 8 Ball offers most everything you could want in a pool game. Sure, Minnesota Fats doesn't host its tutorial, but there's something refreshing about keeping it all on the same engine. Load times are minimal. Its only real shortcoming is the one you may be familiar with from any game requiring you to control complex three-dimensional geometry in the two-dimensional world of the computer monitor. Unless someone develops an actual cue stick controller peripheral, pool control is going to remain a little dicey. <i>--Josh Smith</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Fortunately, the controls have also been updated to allow you to strategically jump over approaching enemies. <i>--Brett Atwood</i>', '<b>Pros:</b>', '', ""Games from the golden age of arcades seem to be slowly rising in popularity, as nostalgic gamers relive past glory with their favorite classic games. In response, game developers seem to be in a scramble to give classic arcade games a face-lift and a release on current consoles. Unfortunately, in most cases, a remake isn't as good as its predecessor, and while this new Centipede can stand on its own, it fails to capture the magic of the original."", ""This time around, the game has a plotline. You're Wally, a simpleton bean counter who's somehow chosen to pilot the Wee people's last hope, The Shooter, against the QueenPede and her countless brood. In five different worlds, you fly about, shooting bugs, creating mushrooms, defending villages, and rescuing your fellow Wee people from the clutches of the vile centipedes. You've got better tricks at your disposal, as you'll be able to upgrade your main cannon, fire secondary weapons, and use shields. However, the game is pretty much the same. You turn countless centipedes into mushrooms, blast spiders, and avoid touching anything dangerous."", ""The control of this game takes a little getting used to, but once you're there, you'll enjoy it. Instead of being limited to the bottom third of the screen, you can now roam about the entire 3D environment. Thankfully, the game engine was well designed, making strafing easy, so you can literally fly circles around your enemies. And although the centipedes enter from one side of the screen, they'll always make their way towards you. So if you find yourself running out of space, simply reverse your direction, and voila - more room. You'll learn to use this to your advantage, steering the centipedes toward wherever you need them to go. In addition, The Shooter can jump, so you can hop mushrooms or even climb ledges for special power-ups."", ""The graphics in this game are adequate. The game sports three different views: a top-down view, an up-close-and-personal view from directly behind your craft, and a hybrid middle ground. From the top-down view, things are simple and fairly bland. The graphics really come into their own when you switch to the close-up view, where the 'pedes start to look menacing and dangerous, houses look like more than just squares, and the Wees you rescue look much more alive. Everything takes on a cartoony look in this view, as the enemies have huge balloon eyes, the mushrooms pop out of the ground when you shoot the centipedes, and the Wee people look very elfish. The worlds all have their distinct look and are well designed - if it weren't for the mind-numbing repetition, they'd stand out better."", ""Think of a generic techno beat, and you've got the soundtrack to this game. While it's not really intrusive, it's nothing you'll turn up the volume to hear. The sound effects are carried over from the original and help the nostalgic effect this game is trying so hard to achieve."", 'Bundled into the package is an arcade mode, which presents you with a port of the original game. Unfortunately, the transition again falls short of the original, with even worse graphics and a low frame rate. While people unfamiliar with the original might enjoy playing this mode, gamers looking to Centipede for an authentic, arcade-perfect experience will be sorely disappointed.', ""What developers don't realize is that nostalgic gamers who still play classic arcade games play them because they enjoy the experience of playing with vector graphics with a simple control scheme and substandard sound. It's truly difficult to compare games of yesterday with games of today, as almost everything has changed technologically. It feels as if Centipede is trying so hard to recapture the magic of the original, by latching onto itself to extinct gameplay, that it pulls what could have been a great 3D shooter into the hollow of mediocrity. --Ben Stahl <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Enter Scrabble, the game you used to play on your kitchen table; it\'s now on your TV screen, and that\'s probably telling enough. Perhaps more versatile than the board game itself, this version has three modes of play: normal, solitaire, and tournament.  In the normal mode, you play against another human or a computer opponent in a single match. If you select the computer player, you\'ll be able to select its intelligence level. These levels include novice, beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert, champion, master, and grand master. The solitaire mode is pretty self-explanatory: You play a round against yourself, aiming to earn as many points as possible. The tournament mode is a single-player game in which you play your way through the ranks of computer opponents - beginning with the dimmest and working your way up to the grand masters in an attempt to become the Scrabble champ yourself. And it\'s not too tough. One of the only downsides is that you can\'t manipulate the CPU into believing some stupid word you heard once in a foreign film you didn\'t understand and misspelled wrong in the first place is actually a word you should receive points for. The interface is 2D, allowing you all the traditional board-game Scrabble functions, from rearranging your letters on the rack before placing them on the ""board"" to trading in the sour letters at the cost of a turn. And you can\'t keep your pals from cheating in two-player mode as any idiot can figure out, because you\'re looking at the same screen. But ""Turn around before I kick you out of my house"" is one way to deal with it. The Scrabble hard sell? It does the math for you. The worst thing? You can\'t cheat by stowing illicit tiles in your lap.  Scrabble on the PlayStation appears to be exactly what you expect from Scrabble at your mom\'s house - minus the little wooden letters that look like bouillon cubes. It\'s slow, there aren\'t any power-ups, no one jumps out of the ceiling to shoot you in midturn, and you can\'t apply stealth in any way whatsoever. If you\'re the card playing, board-game digging type, this\'ll probably be right up your alley - or you could buy one of those jazzy lazy-Susan Scrabble boards for about the same price. But don\'t go into it expecting Scrabble on the PlayStation to be anything but Scrabble with a cathode-ray glow.<i>--Lauren Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Glover,,"['OVER 30 LEVELS TO EXPLORE ACROSS SIX UNIQUE WORLDS', 'OVER 30 BIZARRE AND FUNNY CHARACTERS', 'CLEVER THEMED PUZZLES THAT REQUIRE THE USE OF BOTH GLOOVE AND BALL']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Glover, in concept, is a novel approach to the often-trite realm of the platform game. The thoughtful marriage of puzzle elements with action-oriented gameplay is a pleasant step away from the usual, twitchy platform fare. On the PlayStation platform, though, the concept is only marginally realized, due to the title's mediocre presentation. Perhaps the port from the N64 was too much for the little guy to bear.  The narrative unfolds as follows: In a faraway land, a wizard is charged with the task of guarding his kingdom's power source, a set of magical crystals. This wizard dabbles in alchemy, and one fateful day, an experiment goes awry: Doodling with the wrong alchemical components has caused what he was brewing to explode, literally knocking his gloves off, one flying out the window, the other falling into the cauldron. Exposure to this brew, presumably, granted his accessories sentience, and, conveniently enough, for the purpose of storytelling, one became good, the other evil. Unfortunately, the mishap scattered the crystals in the wizard's charge all across the kingdom and turned the poor chap to stone. Luckily, Glover, the good glove, was able to weave a spell that turned the crystals into red bouncy balls before they fell to the ground and shattered, along with the hope and livelihood of the kingdom. While the narrative is definitely endearing, the port wasn't kind, and, unfortunately, it has a rough bearing on the gameplay.  You play as Glover, and your quest is to retrieve these crystals before Cross-Stitch, your evil twin, gets his mitts on them. The game is laid out in a series of six worlds, each containing five levels. While the objective of each world (defeat boss; recover crystal) doesn't stray too much from the platform convention, the actions required to solve each world definitely take on an unconventional tone. In order to complete each level successfully, Glover must scoot the ball (which is really a crystal) toward the end of each stage. Blocking him is a series of obstacles, including enemies (which are, sadly, much of a nonpresence in that they're insanely simple to avoid) and puzzles. The emphasis is definitely on the latter aspect, and this is where Glover shines; see, the ball Glover carries can be transmuted into a number of different forms: a bouncy rubber ball, a heavy bowling ball, a magnetic ball bearing, and a fragile crystal. Each form carries its own properties, letting Glover manage a certain terrain or solve a certain puzzle. Glover uses the rubber ball to walk on water, the bowling ball to walk underwater, etc. The physics model that is used grants each form very realistic properties, affecting how far it can be thrown or how high or frequently it bounces. Glover is armed with a variety of attacks, including the ball-swat, in which he swats the ball in one of its heavier forms toward the enemy, thus squashing the enemy, and the fist-drop, which is very similar to the token platform butt-drop, save that Glover actually assumes the form of a fist and pummels any creature unfortunate enough to be under him. When throwing (which is paramount to the completion of many of the game's puzzles) or swatting the ball, you're able to choose the ball's trajectory. This feature is inadequate ,usually allowing no more than four trajectories for the ball to follow, mainly corresponding to cardinal directions. During certain boss battles, it becomes unnecessarily difficult to aim the ball in the enemy's general direction, let alone fight efficiently.  The game's presentation, however, is the factor that most largely damages Glover. While the environments look more or less adequate, the character models are severely blurry and underdetailed, making the whole thing seem less than polished. Due to the ubiquitous low-res elements, the entire game appears rather bland and sedate. This fact, unfortunately, brings the otherwise thoughtful and expressive environments down. The music and sounds are venomously tinny and have a certain disturbingly pervasive quality to them; they'll creep into your brain, and you will dream about them for nights to come. The entire presentation makes you feel as if you're playing half a game, rather than a solid, deep full game.  Perhaps Glover 2 (which is being developed for the N64 and the PlayStation) will be something to get a bit more excited about. Glover, despite its interesting play mechanics, seems to have lost its soul in the port from the N64. Very unfortunate. With the host of platformers available for the PlayStation, finding an adequate substitute shouldn't prove too difficult.<i>--Miguel Lopez</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Using a highly realistic tank model, you'll see action across North Africa, Italy, and Normandy as you take on historically accurate missions. Challenges include scouting, protecting truck convoys, sealing off villages, and the search-and-rescue of missing units."", '1998 was to be the year that tank simulation fans would have their long-standing wish fulfilled for a realistic World War II tank sim. No fewer than three such games were scheduled for release: Interactive Magic\'s iPanzer \'44, SSI\'s Panzer Commander, and Psygnosis\' Panzer Elite. iPanzer and Panzer Commander were released on schedule, and SSI\'s game was generally considered the better of the two. However, Psygnosis elected to hold on to Panzer Elite for another year of development by German developer Wings Simulations. It would appear that the extra time paid off, because Panzer Elite is without a doubt the most realistic 1940s tank sim yet released. Even so, the game contains numerous bugs out of the box, requires a fast system, and has a steep learning curve. In addition, the campaigns covering battles between the Americans and Germans in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and Normandy limit the game\'s scope. <P>It\'s inevitable that comparisons will be made between Panzer Elite and SSI\'s Panzer Commander. The most glaring omission from SSI\'s game was infantry, but Wings did not make the same mistake with Panzer Elite. Although the bitmapped infantry units won\'t wow you, driving your tank platoon into a town occupied by enemy infantry is a sure recipe for disaster - as it should be. American infantry armed with bazookas and German infantry armed with panzerfaust and panzerschreck antitank weapons will move about in close terrain and pick off your vehicles one by one. Therefore, making use of combined arms (armor, infantry, and artillery) is a necessity. <P>Panzer Commander featured air and artillery support, but you had no control over it. Panzer Elite lets you put artillery and air strikes where you need them, when you need them. The only problem with Panzer Elite\'s treatment of artillery is that it seems unrealistically deadly as a tank killer and is perhaps more lethal than it should be against infantry under cover. <P>Panzer Commander\'s terrain was good, but Panzer Elite\'s terrain is better. The dips and folds in the ground that can provide armor with cover and concealment, even in relatively flat desert terrain, are present in both games. What sets Panzer Elite apart is the close terrain. Forests are made up of individual trees and bushes. Towns consist of walls, fences, ruins, and buildings that can be smashed through by your tanks. <P>Panzer Elite also deserves credit for having better artificial intelligence that not only makes enemy units fight smarter, but also helps the members of your tank platoon stay near your command tank. This lets them make a real contribution in battle. In too many Panzer Commander scenarios, you sometimes felt as if it was your tank against the world because your platoonmates either got stuck on an obstacle or were quickly destroyed. Panzer Elite provides an innovative feature that lets you maneuver your tanks individually to locations you select. However, this doesn\'t always work as it should. Sometimes your tanks will end up in positions far different than you intended or will take convoluted routes that unnecessarily expose them to danger. It\'s a great idea that\'s flawed in execution. <P>The game\'s interface relies heavily on a mind-boggling array of keyboard commands. The ""mouse tank"" feature, an onscreen line diagram showing your tank\'s heading and the relative position of the turret and hull, lets you give basic commands through a pop-up menu to members of your tank platoon, either individually or as a group. You can also use the pop-up menu to jump to different crew positions, such as the loader, gunner, driver, radio operator/hull machine gunner, and commander. However, you\'ll soon discover there are many other useful commands that aren\'t displayed on the menu. Plus, in the heat of battle, the keyboard commands can be issued far more quickly. -- <i>Patrick C. Miller</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Once in the first-person view, you'll start to get a feel for the tiny world in which the Wee People live - from the lighthouses perched on pebbles to the windmills hidden beneath tall blades of grass. Unfortunately, once you've seen one Wee village, you've seen 'em all. Sound effects are present in the game, but they give you the sensation that there's still something missing. A generic techno beat fills the background music, and remade versions of the classic sound effects tell you when you hit something, but at times it seems as though the appropriate sound effect is missing. Also, while the soundtrack and sound effects are clear, the audio that runs during the cutscenes has a lot of hiss to it, and, and it sounds rather low-quality.  If you've got a friend who's up for saving a few Wee People, you can play cooperatively. This mode is actually pretty cool, though with the exception of the split screen, there's no difference between this mode and the one-player mode. The frame rate stays at a smooth level, and the pop-up remains just as unnoticed.  Like most classic games being remade, Centipede also features a fairly accurate port of the original game. But unlike in the PlayStation version, the original game actually does well on the Dreamcast, with a perfect frame rate and accurate graphics and sound. Fans of the original will be pleased will the excellent translation. Unfortunately, as with virtually all the classic games reborn on a current-day console, playing the new version of Centipede is really nothing like playing the original. What's really disappointing is that instead of shooting centipedes over and over, you could have instead been exploring a great 3D world and blasting away tons of cool enemies. But instead, Centipede tries too hard to latch on to the classic gaming experience, and it pulls what could have been a great 3D shooter into the hollows of the average. <i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Pong: The Next Level,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['In a world where no classic game is safe from being converted into a current-day remake, the game that started it all has finally had its number called. A whole new generation now has the opportunity to fall in love with the new Pong - the Pong of a new millennium - on the PlayStation console. But before you dust off your paddles and call all your friends over, you may want to ponder this - was Pong really all that fun, or was it just that there were no other video games? The basic concept of Pong hasn\'t changed - keep the ball from entering the goal by deflecting it with the paddle. But the latest edition of Pong at least keeps things slightly interesting by introducing several new game elements, many of which have their own levels. Sometimes you\'ll have sheep and penguins on the board with you; other times, huge fans will blow your ball to and fro, and you\'ll have to bounce a colored ball into its place. The new version of Pong also introduces a power-up system. You can introduce computer controlled blockers, perform super-shots, and even grab the ball itself (your paddle hugs around it). But still, the game is pretty much the same as it was 26 years ago. The graphics are simple and nice. There seems to be some weird theme running through the game that your paddle is alive, as it jumps around and acts generally pleased when you beat a level. Aside from that, the animation is fairly generic. The things that you run into while playing behave as they should - sheep hop about, penguins waddle, and frogs jump. There are some fairly creative level designs here, like the log-jammer level, which has logs that push the ball in certain directions, or the chicken-egg level, where a rack of chickens lay various colored eggs for you to sort. These are a nice touch and obviously more welcome than the simple black-and-white graphics of the original. While the music in the game is fairly good, the sound effects are really bothersome. While each level is loading, your paddle will giggle and make all other sorts of weird noises, which you\'ll likely find as disturbing as I did. Maybe it\'s just the pitch at which the paddle ""speaks,"" but after one or two levels, I cringed every time I heard it. Unfortunately, the control really isn\'t up to par. The digital control is way too touchy, and the analog control seems to be too loose. There\'s nothing more frustrating than giving up a point simply because the control is so unresponsive. Also, the computer paddles are really good, especially in the games where there\'s a paddle directly in front of yours. This forces you to exploit weaknesses in the AI - such as bouncing a shot off the wall - and it makes you feel as if you\'re only winning because the computer is dumb. Another thing you\'ll notice is that the computer will line itself up directly in front of your paddle after a point is scored, but when it serves, it immediately shoots the ball out, without giving you a chance to maneuver in front of it. This will make you almost dread the four-paddle games, as they\'re fairly one-sided. Looking for a revolutionary, new, exciting game? Perhaps you should look elsewhere, because when it all boils down, this game is still Pong. Sure, there are new levels, and the game has been changed quite a bit, but you\'re still moving a stupid paddle up and down a playing field and hitting a ball. Few people are likely to get a thrill out of playing the original Pong anymore, and, unfortunately, the Pong of the new generation doesn\'t do much better.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Redneck Rampage - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Redneck rampage and redneck rampage rounds again Arkansas Games', 'Just when it seemed that publishers had shipped every possible variant of the first-person 3D shooter, Interplay has pulled the genre from the swamp. <P> And they did it with redneck jokes. Redneck Rampage packages the Duke Nukem 3D engine with a low-concept theme - invading aliens are cloning backcountry hicks - that could have very easily fallen apart. But Redneck Rampage works on several levels - as a shooter, adventure, and humor title. This is a clever, fun, and challenging game with great characters, crisp sound effects, and inventive - though at times very frustrating - gameplay. <P> The backwoods deep south is near-universally the butt of jokes, and the game delivers them through the perspective of Leonard, the game\'s rampaging hero. In the opening scene, the Jim Varney-lookalike cocks his pistol and says he\'s ""out to open up a can o\' whup ass."" His goal is to kill off the aliens who snatched a pig right out of the bed of his pickup and, it turns out, are starting their invasion of earth by cloning the moronic local folk. The aliens in the first few levels are chirping, feces-flinging gremlins, while the local yokels greet you with shotguns and rifles. Vicious dogs attack without provocation, with the exception of one mutt that remains frozen in mid-leap until you get his attention with a bullet or crowbar. <P> Though the tabloid alien-abduction plot feels a bit dated, there\'s more than enough splatter and gags to compensate. The player sends Leonard into a sewage treatment plant, dairy, junkyard, mobile-home park (complete with a nasty tornado problem), and other locales. He must find the skeleton keys that help him work his way to the nose-picking, crotch-adjusting Bubba and whap him upside the head with a crowbar to complete each level. Our hero\'s arsenal includes weapons such as a scattergun, a dynamite crossbow, and a gun that launches ripsaw blades. Thanks to the Build engine, he can blow up cows, trash jukeboxes, smash windows, and generally leave destruction in his wake, just as Duke could. <P> The game\'s humor works. Xatrix Entertainment invested the time to load Redneck up with endless little in-jokes and details - the game is a rich, twisted parody of the deep south. Moon Pie snacks become Cow Pie power-ups, and Leonard has a repertoire of post-killing punchlines such as ""You plays with the bull, ya gets the horns."" Other touches of humor are more subtle. If Leonard dives into a well and swims along an underwater tunnel, he\'ll come up for air in the outhouse. Health is restored by drinking moonshine and cheap-ass whiskey - but watch your intake! Too much \'shine and you\'ll be lurching out of control. While Leonard can ""take a quick pee"" to sober up a bit, more obvious scatological gags fall flat - including the straining, splashing sound effects that start up whenever he nears a toilet. <P> Farts aside, the game\'s sound effects are sharp, from the echoing crack of an automatic rifle report, to the crash of pins in the bowling alley, to Leonard\'s painful ""ow!"" when he\'s hit or bitten by a giant mosquito. The Reverand Horton Heat pumps out of jukeboxes in several parts of the game, and Mojo Nixon and The Beat Farmers are included on the game\'s soundtrack. <P> While shoot-outs are fun, a strong adventure element underscores the gameplay. Leonard must open fridges, run machinery, climb hidden ladders, and ride concealed elevators. The player can easily get stuck, wandering endlessly in search of the well-hidden key that will open a door and advance a level. Interplay is likely doing great business with their 1-900 hint line. Controls can be frustrating to get the hang of, especially when the player is trying to time a crucial split-second jump from a wrecked car or a bale of hay. One such jump demanded 15 or 20 practice runs. On every other level, this tight maneuvering, combined with the sometimes too well concealed skeleton keys, stalls out the otherwise addictive gameplay. <P> Overlooking the controls and difficulty issues, this is a fresh, funny, inventive take on a formula that grows more tired every time the FedEx guy shows up at the GameSpot offices with a box. If you liked Duke Nukem - and you\'re ready for a twist - you\'ll find Redneck a hoot. <i>--James Glave</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

With the enticing capabilities of 3D graphics hardware support and a general resurgence in science fiction themes, it was only a matter of time before gaming companies would, once again, try to break LucasArts\' and Origin Systems\' collective stranglehold over the genre. At last a worthy challenger has arrived. Descent: Freespace is one of a number of recently released or announced space-sim titles from developers who are better known for creating successful gaming series in other genres. <P> When the plot of Descent: Freespace begins, the ever-warmongering Terrans are in the midst of a 14-year misunderstanding with the Vasudans. While the Vasudans and the Terrans are fairly evenly matched, they quickly put aside their differences when a third race appears, the technologically superior Shivans. Although a rebel Vasudan faction continues to harass the new Vasudan-Terran alliance, the main threat comes from the Shivans and their monstrous capital ship, the Lucifer. From the opening animated cutscene, Descent: Freespace does an excellent job at maintaining the aura of the Shivans as a mysterious, unstoppable force. When you first encounter the Shivans, you won\'t even be able to target their jet-black ships, and the weapons that seemed so impressive against the Vasudans will barely make an impression on the Shivans and their seemingly invulnerable shields. At first you have to avoid direct conflicts with the superior Shivans and instead embark on missions to steal their technology in order to improve the capabilities of your ships. In fact, there\'s a real X-COM feel to the game, as you uncover the mysteries of the Shivans and constantly improve the technology of your ships and weaponry. <P> Very little about Descent: Freespace is entirely original, but the developers did an admirable job at extracting the best features from previous spaces sims. Everything from the ""sink the behemoth"" branching plot to the stylish interface, mission briefings, and graphics appears to be plucked from other games of the genre, but improved. In many ways, the graphics closely resemble those used in Wing Commander Prophecy and make especially good use of colored lighting, shielding, lens flare, and engine blast effects. <P> Combat in Descent: Freespace also more closely resembles the fast-paced, missile-blasting, afterburner sliding frag fests of the Wing Commander series than the World War II style of combat favored by the Star Wars sims. Descent: Freespace is probably the most missile-intensive game yet seen in the genre, but fortunately single missile hits aren\'t usually too destructive to your ship. Afterburners can only be utilized in short bursts, requiring you to tactically reserve them for when they are most useful.<P> The customizable interface of Descent: Freespace is outstanding - easily the best yet seen in the genre. The interface was clearly designed to make useful information, such as the status of escorted ships, the direction and the distance of approaching missiles, mission objectives, and the condition of your wingmen, constantly available on your screen. <P> The plot of Descent: Freespace advances through animated cutscenes, periodic ""news"" updates on the status of the war, as well as through mission briefings and the occasional scripted mission event. Overall, these methods combine to provide a compelling, if somewhat disjointed, storyline.<P> There are approximately 30 single-player missions in the branching campaign and 20 multiplayer missions. The mission objectives are nicely varied and include ""kill \'em all"" missions, stealthy inspection missions, a mission that resembles a giant game of Asteroids, and some epic capital ship confrontations near the end of the game. Descent: Freespace automatically saves after each campaign mission, and you can\'t independently save the game, which is a bit disappointing, since it prevents you from exploring the various campaign ""branches"" without restarting the entire campaign.<P> Multiplayer support for up to 12 players is included either through a TCP/IP network or the Internet through the free Parallax Online servers. Parallax Online keeps detailed pilot statistics and is an extremely streamlined service, with an intuitive interface and seamless integration with the multiplayer interface of Descent: Freespace. Unfortunately, even after two patches, most gamers will find a multiplayer game of Descent: Freespace over the Internet to be completely unplayable due to lag. Unlike first-person shooter games, where an environment\'s walls and a player\'s line of sight will naturally limit the number of objects that a client has to keep track of at any one time, the open areas of space-combat simulations have historically proven very difficult to use as online multiplayer arenas. Multiplayer support was eventually removed from Wing Commander Prophecy because Origin wasn\'t satisfied that it would work well, and even earlier in that game\'s development Internet multiplayer support was removed. Even X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter limits multiplayer support to four players over Microsoft\'s Internet Gaming Zone. In that context, it\'s astonishing that Interplay and Volition were, almost until the game was released, advertising Descent: Freespace as capable of supporting 16 players online, when in fact the retail version of the game is currently incapable of even adequately supporting two players each using 56K modems. <P> Still, unless you are only looking for a multiplayer dogfighting area (in which case you\'ll be doubly disappointed, since deathmatch support was removed late in development entirely, in favor of cooperative and team vs. team missions) there\'s a lot to like about Descent: Freespace. It\'s a noble effort to both cannibalize the best elements of classics of the genre and also provide a number of refreshing innovations. While Descent: Freespace isn\'t quite the standout game it could have been, it\'s a welcome step in the right direction for the genre. Highly recommended. <i>--Desslock</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Jack Nicklaus's contribution to golf has long been an inspiration to golfers worldwide. With the Golden Bear Challenge, play as or against Jack. Be in his cleats as he tees off and putts. With lifelike golfers, camera control, and enhanced graphics, feel like you are really playing the green. Choose one of six golf courses and become a legend."", ""The Jack Nicklaus golf series has been a critical darling since it reemerged several years ago with the superb Jack Nicklaus 4, but that hasn't helped it fly off the shelves any faster. It and its sequel, Jack Nicklaus 5, received rave reviews but flat sales, leaving a cash-strapped Accolade to sell its crown jewel to Activision. The core design team, lead by Jack 4 creator Mike Franco, stayed with the product line when it jumped to Activision, and has created the superlative Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge. Maybe with a fresh start at a new publisher, this game can finally find the audience it richly deserves."", ""Jack Nicklaus 6 is fundamentally very similar to its predecessors, but improves on it in many important ways. The game follows the pattern of not only offering a cutting-edge golf game with multiple courses, but also a stunningly powerful course editor. This mix makes it far and away the greatest value and most replayable golf game on the market. (Since many stores, like CompUSA, are selling it for only $20, it's even more of a value.) Owners of previous Jack Nicklaus games will see some familiar options and menu items, but once you get in the game, it becomes clear just how much has changed."", 'Jack Nicklaus 6 is a more streamlined, better-looking game. The minute you see that beautifully rendered fully 3D Nicklaus waggling at the tee, you can tell the visual benchmark has been raised. There are ten meticulously crafted, motion-captured, hardware-accelerated 3D golfers. Their fluid motion and animations look very natural, and they work perfectly in the 2D game world. Terrain is as sharp and photorealistic as Links, with excellent object modeling and amazing terrain effects and sloping. Some small animations, such as divots and flags, help bring the course alive with a minimum of fuss. Hardware acceleration is not mandatory, but it greatly smoothes the terrain and makes the golfers look spectacular. Without it, there is some slight pixelization; and even with it. there are some of the odd smoothing effects that tend to make hardware-accelerated graphics look a touch fuzzy at the edges. But overall, this is one fabulous-looking game.', ""The main screen and in-game options have been optimized to highlight this natural beauty. There are myriad preset camera angles (low, medium, high, and aerial from different angles) that can be viewed full screen or in moveable windows, including the hole map. You can also move and aim the camera anywhere on the course to create any view you like or set the game up to switch angles automatically. You can set the game up to view that 3D club from a tee's eye view, from the gallery, or from anywhere else, and you can shoot from these angles as well. The putting view is handled in the best manner I've ever seen. Instead of just using the traditional contoured grid, the developers have color-coded the grid so you can read the slope of the green with great accuracy. Add in some new (although repetitive) color commentary from Jim Nantz and Gary McCord as well as great flyovers and audio tips from Nicklaus, and you have a very full audio-visual experience."", ""All this eye-candy is brought together by excellent club control and physics. You can use two-click, three-click, or dynamic mouse swing interface, and each works just fine. Shots can be shaped very precisely, with the gamer in total control of the amount of fade and draw as well as trajectory. With one notable exception, physics are exemplary. Sand, rough, wind effects, and sidehill lies are all perfect. I did, however, struggle with the putting. Even with clobbering the hell out of my ball, all my putts fell short. I couldn't figure it out. I would even extend the aim line far beyond the cup and not make the second click, maxing out my power, and the ball would still fall short. It feels like a bug."", ""In a real switch, Jack Nicklaus 6 also incorporates some of the golfer profile elements from the Greg Norman and Microsoft Golf games. When creating your golfer, you can allot points to power, accuracy, bunker, short game, and putting to create a profile that will effect how your computer golfer performs. This doesn't mean good clicking skills are less important, but it does give the golfers more personality and create a more balanced variety of golfers. The only problem with the point allotment element of the golfer profile is that it's tied to the swing type (faster or slower). You get fewer points if you use a slower swing meter, which may stack the deck against novices."", ""The course designer has remained largely the same as in previous versions: You have complete control over the look and shape of an entire golf course. It's still a hole-based designer, so you must design one hole at a time instead of a course that shares features (like a river or mountain), but it's so damn good this hardly matters. The games ships with six courses, but literally hundreds of user-made courses can be imported with no graphical loss whatsoever. This instantly makes Jack 6 the game with the most courses by a considerable factor. Add in the best, most stable Internet golf play going, and you have the most full and well-rounded golf game on the market. Since you can find it for $20, this is far and away the beast deal in computer gaming."", 'If you have to buy only one golf game this year, make it Jack Nicklaus 6. <i>--T.

Battlezone 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Jump in and take command in a fight that spans six exotic worlds with diverse environments--from steaming, swampy jungles crawling with deadly creatures, to rocky wastelands strewn with boiling lava pits, to ruined cities half-buried in nuclear snow. Players start by building a base from which they command a force of armored vehicles, infantry, and aircraft through a series of exploratory, offensive, and defensive missions. Gamers will drive a variety of tanks and walkers, pilot scout ships, and even jump out and fight an evil and challenging alien enemy on foot. Each side will choose from an arsenal of powerful weapons, including guided missiles, mortars, mines, and bazookas.', ""Activision's Battlezone has become better known for its poor sales than for the fact that it was a great game. It combined elements of real-time strategy and action games to create a hybrid that was at once unique, intuitive, and fun. Most everyone who played it loved it. Whatever the reason for Battlezone's disappointing sales, it certainly wasn't the quality of the game. Unfortunately, in what must have been an effort to make Battlezone's sequel more marketable, developer Pandemic Studios attempted to fix something that wasn't broken. As a result, Battlezone II is just a dumbed-down version of its predecessor. Battlezone was set in the late 1960s during a secret space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. The two superpowers on Earth were attempting to become superpowers on other worlds as well and were fighting to colonize and mine resources from the planets in the solar system. Toward the end of the game, a hostile alien race appeared that forced the warring earthlings to team up against the new threat. Their alliance is the basis for the sequel, which begins with you serving as a lieutenant for the ISDF, a multinational fighting force attempting to combat alien terrorism. Your apparent enemy is the Scion, an alien race that is building some sort of superweapon and destroying ISDF outposts. However, even from the beginning it is clear that something else is amiss. You are given conflicting orders, put in harm's way more than seems necessary, and then told to remain silent about your operations. There's something going on that's more than meets the eye, and watching the story unfold is one of the more enjoyable elements of Battlezone II. That the campaign's story is interesting enough to motivate you from mission to mission is a good thing, because Battlezone II's missions themselves are often boring. Whereas Battlezone was entertaining precisely because of the sheer amount of control it put it your hands, Battlezone II is dull because it isn't as flexible. Early missions typically tell you what to do, step by step, and lack any of the base building and resource gathering that made the first game fun. Instead, you just follow your commander around and perform various small tasks and listen to reports of other more interesting activities as they occur elsewhere in the field. The first ten missions in the game feel like tutorials, and it isn't until you've played through at least a dozen missions that you're given the ability to plan and build your base and assemble an army of units. Even when you finally take control of an army, it feels less significant than in Battlezone. Inevitably, you'll be planning your base defenses and preparing to build offensive units when you'll receive an order to go explore an event happening somewhere else, and you'll have to abandon the strategy portion of the game to go on some solo excursion. In fact, you spend so much time on short solo missions that it seems as if the real-time strategy elements of the game are almost an afterthought. <I>--Ron Dulin </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Railroad Tycoon 2: Second Century Expansion Pack - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Ride the rails back in time: From 1939 through 1950, do your part for the war effort. Deliver troops and supplies to the besieged Allied front. Rebuild the British rail system after its destruction in the Blitz. Protect Mother Russia from the advancing Germans. <P> Next stop, the modern era: Solve the transportation problems facing the modern world from 1950 to 2005.

The United States is a watery wasteland. The Mediterranean is an empty basin with a blossoming Eden. Antarctica is a promising agricultural center. The heady task of providing rail systems for this strange and exotic world falls upon your shoulders. No doubt, only the most ingenious solutions will do."", 'It\'s an adage that add-ons can be tougher than the original game. That adage applies in spades to the Railroad Tycoon II expansion pack, The Second Century. For fans of Railroad Tycoon II who may have exhausted the original scenarios and campaigns, The Second Century adds some hefty new challenges. <P> The Second Century consists of 18 new scenarios, including five new campaigns. Most of the features added to the game consist of new industries, buildings, and trains - relatively few new gameplay features have been added, the most significant being the ability to have cargo carry through intermediate stations. <P> All the scenarios are fairly difficult, though some are downright fiendish. Most of the difficulty lies in either the victory conditions, which can be quite demanding, or the terrain, which can make laying rail a hair-pulling proposition. Since the real value of this pack is the scenarios, let\'s dive into railroading\'s second century by taking a look at the most compelling of these. <P> The historical scenarios are split up between late 19th century and near-modern (post World War I) eras. One of the more interesting campaigns is the North to Alaska campaign. There are no competitors, and you get an automatic stipend of $150,000 per year from the US Government. The year is 1930, and the country is in the midst of the Great Depression. All you have to do is build a rail line from Seattle to Fairbanks as a sort of public works project to keep people employed. Of course, if you can get rich in the process.... <P> It seems like a piece of cake, and in fact, it\'s one of the easier campaigns for you to achieve at least minimum victory conditions. But it\'s something of a precursor to later maps, because right away, you\'re faced with a difficult track-laying procedure. It\'s simple enough to build a line from Seattle to Vancouver, but stretching beyond Canada\'s west coast metropolis is a tough proposition due to a seemingly impenetrable mountain range. Here, your inability to build tunnels in Railroad Tycoon II is a frustration, but if you study the map carefully, you\'ll see you can successfully construct a switchback over the mountain range between Vancouver and Williams Lake. <P> In the Battle of Britain campaign, there\'s no stock market, no competition, you can\'t build new stations, and you can\'t buy new locomotives. The time scale is different, too, as the campaign covers a scant 12 days; most Railroad Tycoon veterans are used to multiyear campaigns. This campaign is Railroad Tycoon II\'s version of that venerable circus arcade game whack-a-mole crossed with a trace-the-maze game. <P> The gist of the campaign is this: You\'re managing the British rail system during the Battle of Britain (1940). You can repair six segments of track per day. You have to move a certain amount of cargo in the form of war material and troops to specific locations. It becomes an exercise in finding the key connector routes and making sure they stay repaired. Of course, as time passes, segments of tracks get bombed, and trains get strafed. You have to keep your trains moving and key track segments repaired. While interesting as a sort of puzzle, it\'s an almost mind-numbing exercise. <P> Mother Russia is a much more compelling strategic exercise than the Battle of Britain campaign. Here, you actually affect the progress of Germany\'s Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Russia in June 1941. By moving men and material around, you can counterbalance the military strength of the Germans. This is handled somewhat artificially through ""strength points."" As war material and troops pour into a region, the total strength goes up - but the Germans are building up, too. If the Russian strength in a given sector falls below that of the German military machine, you lose that territory. The key is to be very patient and keep the game speed down low. You start with a fairly skimpy cash reserve, and though you do incur the usual costs, they\'re offset by a steady income flow in the early stages.<P> Some of the most interesting and challenging scenarios are the hypothetical ones. Some take place in a future era, others in hypothetical regions. <P> Take Mediterranean Basin, for instance. Imagine that the Mediterranean Sea has been completely drained of water. I know, it\'s a tough sell, but you can do it. Now you have the entire former seabed to exploit. But the terrain is fiendishly difficult in places. Most major cities lie on what was once mainland Europe, North Africa, or islands - and that means steep climbs. <P> This one is actually great fun because of the start date: 2006. You not only get some nifty new high-tech trains, but also some new industries - the weirdest being the Geocore power plant. Unfortunately, you really need to start out with some moneymaking lines on the European mainland to start generating hard currency, so it\'s some time before you start into the Med itself. <P> The Antarctica campaign lets you build on the southernmost continent. This one is tough because you have to ignore your past RRT experience. In the standard game, one common strategy is to build a few short, fairly lucrative passenger lines to keep the cash coming to fund your more ambitious projects, not to mention industry acquisitions. But there are relatively few settlements in Antarctica (no surprise there). So you have to focus on connecting resources to manufacturing, then finding outlets for the goods. There are a number of port cities that demand certain raw materials, but those are limited to just a few items. It\'s challenging also because you only have a couple different trains to pick from. <P> Seattle Metro is probably the toughest scenario in the game, and it\'s a doozy. You\'re presented with a map of the greater Seattle area, and your goal is to build an effective mass transit system. The scale is much different, covering a much smaller geographical region than most RRT maps. In addition, there are lots of pesky houses and commercial property to make your track laying a nightmare. The final complication is that, unlike most Railroad Tycoon maps, there are many different types of passengers. You really have to consider the different types of passengers in planning your routes and consider the demand of each particular station. Even after you\'ve gotten a few stations up and running, you have to keep checking them, because the demand for passenger types keeps shifting. <P> There are certainly more scenarios that I didn\'t have time to explore. Imagine developing a railroad system in China or keeping Berlin fed during the Berlin Crisis. Or consider the challenge of building a railroad between France and Great Britain - but beware those Chunnel expenses! <P> The game comes with a full map/scenario editor and supports up to four players in multiplayer mode, either on a local area network or over the Internet. If you have a lot of Railroad Tycoon II saved games, and you get The Second Century, be sure to download the 1.51 patch, which fixes some problems with loading older save-game files. <P> The bottom line is that The Second Century is a tough but compelling add-on to Railroad Tycoon II. You rapidly discover that your past strategies no longer work, and you have to really think to develop new ones. It\'s certainly a cerebral set of challenges, but if you\'re a serious fan of the game, this is a terrific add-on. If you\'re just starting into Railroad Tycoon II, you may want to pass on this until you master the first game. <i>--Loyd Case</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Star Trek: Starfleet Academy,,['Includes FREE limited edition Starfleet Academy figurine'],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['""The most anticipated 3-D SPACE SIM of the year""-Computer Gaming World""', 'I\'m not really sure why Interplay decided to start publicizing Starfleet Academy nearly three years before its eventual release, but one thing\'s for sure: When you start the hype machine that far in advance, the final product had better deliver all the goods as promised, and then some. Unfortunately for Trek fans and gamers whose appetites have been constantly whetted over the past months, Starfleet Academy just isn\'t up to the task. <P> In all fairness to the folks who worked on Starfleet Academy, part of the reason for the long incubation process was that the project was put on hold while the game\'s producer worked on other titles. But that doesn\'t change the fact that Starfleet Academy looks and plays no better than space combat games from two years ago - and when expectations are as high as they were for this game, that\'s not gonna cut it. <P> Starfleet Academy puts you in the Federation uniform of the sheepish David Forester, who\'s just arrived at Starfleet Academy\'s Command College in San Francisco. Forester is the commander of a group of cadets with a lot of potential - and a lot of emotional baggage. Two team members get into a squabble at the very first team meeting, and that\'s just the first of a series of problems involving each and every member of your crew. Add to this the appearance of a reactionary group at the Academy called the Vanguard, who believe all the Federation\'s problems with the Klingons and Romulans can be solved through brutal retaliation - and the fact that one of your team members sympathizes with this isolationist group - and you can see these aren\'t going to be carefree school days. <P> In addition to keeping your cadets on track, you\'ll also meet Star Trek luminaries such as Hikari Sulu, Pavel Chekhov, and of course the legendary James T. Kirk. All the scenes involving characters at the Academy are handled with full motion video, something of a letdown for those under the impression that the game would give you a chance to move about your quarters or throughout the Academy. And interaction is limited to selecting dialogue responses and then sitting back to see how well you chose. <P> The acting quality ranges from highly polished (Sulu, Chekhov, and Kirk) to competent (Forester and his fellow cadets) to downright uninspired (some of the enemies you face during simulator missions). There\'s actually a pretty decent little mystery that unfolds as you progress deeper into the game, but it\'s just not that compelling a game because the FMV format makes you feel as though you\'re watching a story rather than taking an active part in its solution. <P> This design probably wouldn\'t be an issue if the Starship simulator got your blood pumping. But here again Starfleet Academy falls short - and it\'s not just because all the media hype made gamers expect too much. Interplay was faced with a dilemma here: If the simulator were too ""realistic,"" all the captain could do is bark out orders to his bridge crew - not very exciting stuff. The other option was to go for more of a traditional space combat experience, which puts Starfleet Academy up against games like Wing Commander, Privateer 2, Darklight Conflict, and others. And on that level, Starfleet Academy just doesn\'t pack much of a punch. <P> For starters, you have to run through the rigmarole of allocating damage control teams and adjusting energy settings in anticipation of combat before every mission. This busywork could have been eliminated easily by giving you the option to save several configurations for damage control and energy allocation (full combat, strong tractor beam, strong sensors, and so forth) and simply load the one you want to use. <P> Once you get into a scrape, you\'ll find there\'s no way to look to the left, right, or rear - a serious drawback in a game that\'s little more than a cosmic dogfight - nor are there any external views. Because you\'ve only got two weapons to work with regardless of which class ship you\'re given, it doesn\'t take long for combat to become little more than a routine. About all that breaks up the monotony is the occasional use of the tractor beam or transporter, or the thrill of being able to fire a four-photon spread instead of just two. True, you have to make dialogue choices and command decisions that determine the outcome of the mission, but with very few exceptions the correct responses are pretty obvious. When they\'re not, don\'t bother asking your crew for its input - there\'s no way to query anyone for his opinion unless it\'s offered as a dialogue selection. <P> Another disappointment comes in the visual department. Graphics for ships and explosions are merely adequate in the non-Direct3D version, and though the Direct3D version looks noticeably better, that\'s not saying a whole lot. In short, it looks good, but not great. <P> Because this is a Star Trek game, there\'ll undoubtedly be a few players who\'ll be more than satisfied with what Starfleet Academy has to offer. But gamers who expect a top-notch game to go along with the Star Trek trimmings are likely to be disappointed. <i>--Chris Gregson</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

You will be allowed to go back 10 years in time, on the ship where your father was killed, and be given the opportunity to save him and the Federation.', 'In Simon & Schuster Interactive\'s Star Trek: Borg, you\'re a green Starfleet Academy cadet, logging training hours aboard a Federation starship... and haunted by the memory of your father\'s death, at the hands of the Borg at the battle of Wolf 359. When the dreaded Borg suddenly show up on a beeline course for mother Terra, your ship is selected to join the battlegroup which will engage them, and all trainee personnel are ordered to evacuate. The Borg are a nasty, formidable enemy, and Starfleet Command doesn\'t need any new fish wet-ends like you panicking at the wrong moment in a battle where every action and second counts. The fact that you have reason to want to stay and fight - the fact that your father was killed at the Wolf 359 massacre, aboard the ill-fated USS Righteous - means jack-all to the high command. You can leave and like it... or you can just leave. <P> As you bitterly pack your meager cadet\'s belongings, the infamous alien entity known as ""Q"" (played by John DeLancie) appears in your stateroom and offers you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: With his help, you can travel back in time to the bridge of the Righteous, moments before the ship was lost, and wreak a little vengeance. And maybe - just maybe - save him and change the future for yourself and for everyone else. Borg has it all: time travel; the smarmy, omnipotent Q; the scariest alien race ever to populate the Star Trek universe; and an angry, orphaned cadet\'s passionate (and very un-Federation) wish for brutal retribution. It\'s a promising broth very difficult to spoil. <P> Simon & Schuster Interactive evidently has many, many cooks at its disposal. <P> Borg is that most dubious of game prospects - an ""interactive movie."" Initially whisked aboard the bridge of the Righteous as a Christmas Carol-esque presence nobody can hear or see, you are witness (via full-screen video) to what may be the final moments of the ship (and your father) all over again - and then you are given the opportunity to directly interact with the past as the Borg invade the ship and attempt to drop the shields of the Righteous. At various times during the continuously playing movie that is 99% of the game, the player is given the option to solve puzzles, attack, or analyze people, objects, or Borg (which are, strictly, neither) with a modified tricorder provided by Q. Virtually every decision point in the game, if not every decision point, is a try-and-die affair, resulting in a short cut-movie with a rawthuh disappointed Q telling you what a moron you are, or giving you a condescendingly patient (and, I must admit, rather insultingly cool) primer on how to use the mouse on your computer. <P> Borg is infuriating not only because of the lousy (indeed, almost nonexistent) gameplay, but also because of the obvious tremendous expense and potential of this absolutely lame FMV-fest. The talent involved could have gone to good use, somewhere. As the irritating, haughty (and ever-so-slightly swishy) Q, John DeLancie gives a superb performance that\'s wasted here. (In one spectacular, skin-crawling death-sequence, he stares at a Defense Systems panel, his eyes wide, shouting, ""THE BORG ARE FIRING, WE\'RE GONNA DIE!"" Then - all the mock terror dropping from his face in an instant - he leers knowingly toward the camera and, with a horrible grin, whispers, ""And it\'s your fault,"" as the ship and your father get blown to bits around him.) Ditto the dialogue and story elements - all fine in themselves, wrapped up in a quick-pick-a-path mess with the budget of a motion picture and the gameplay of... well, a motion picture. <P> (And despite my usual stance on this sort of thing, I don\'t even feel bad about blowing any plot points or particular surprises. I figure I\'ll just end up saving you the trouble of buying this dog.) <P> A few words to Trek enthusiasts: No matter how many times some game company out there does something like this to you, just close your eyes and keep repeating to yourself: Interplay\'s Starfleet Academy is coming. Starfleet Academy is coming.... <i>--Chris Hudak</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved. Reproduction in whole or in part in any form or medium without express written permission of GameSpot is prohibited.</i> -- <i>GameSpot Review</i><br /><br />It makes a weird kind of sense that this game would come on a hybrid CD. After all, the raison d\'etre of the Borgs, the eponymous villains of this episode of the venerable Star Trek franchise, is to ""assimilate"" alien races - i.e., take into their ""collective"" the technologies (and bodies) of those they come across. <P>That said, this CD-ROM\'s developers should have spent a little more time studying the Borg\'s methods. Star Trek: Borg doesn\'t have the OS smarts to switch screen resolutions to the mandatory 640 x 480 pixels. (If you launch it at any other resolution, you\'ll get an error message stating: ""You must change your monitor resolution and restart your computer."" Hello? You don\'t need to restart a Mac.) Other irritations include a strange save scheme and no way to open a saved game from within play in case you make a wrong move. <P>Speaking of making wrong moves, that\'s what you\'ll be doing, mostly. Gameplay consists of watching from a first-person perspective what seems to be an episode of Star Trek, and suddenly having to click at Point A or Point B at ""Decision Points,"" which are usually cued by characters who turn to the camera and say, ""What do you think?"" A few puzzles are simple enough if you\'ve checked out the scene with a special tricorder given to you by Q (oh, he\'s the ""omnipotent godbeing"" who\'s tossed you back through time to save your father from the Borg invasion 10 years ago and... well, John deLancie is great as Q, and gets all the good lines). However, many of the puzzles\' answers are obscure, and some even require sort-of cheating: Sometimes the only way to continue the game is to quit and restart at the last saved point. (Here\'s where a ""restore"" function would\'ve been nice.) If you fail, Q may reset the game to the Decision Point, or you may watch a grisly endgame, but either way, there\'s a long video replay to sit through. Tension and fear may be a valid experience in this game, but frustration shouldn\'t be. <P>That said, there are reasons to recommend Star Trek: Borg. As long as RAM Doubler or Virtual Memory is disabled, the full-screen video runs nearly perfectly on a 7600/120; the sets and costumes and sets are, likewise, impeccable (a fan said); the acting is good; there seem to be fewer plot holes in this game than in the average episode, and at times, there is a genuine urgency and intensity to the experience. In fact, this adventure might be, at times, too grim for children. <P>Simon & Schuster is to be commended for releasing this product simultaneously for the Mac and PC (and coincidentally close to the release of the new movie, ""Star Trek: First Contact""); however, given some of the technical frustrations, an extra week or two in development could\'ve made the experience that much more stellar. - D.

Not every package can contain 30 perfect classics. That\'s where this collection of Intellivision games comes in, bringing with it a swift reminder that even in the good old days, some games were just plain terrible. <P>The Intellivision is one of those console systems that most people have forgotten by now. Sure, there are people that are downright fanatical about the system and its games, but by and large its place in history is as ""The system that kids that weren\'t cool enough to have an Atari 2600 had."" <P>Contained in the package are Armor Battle, Astrosmash, Auto Racing, Baseball, Basketball, Boxing, Checkers, Chess, Football, Frog Bog, Golf, Hockey, Hover Force, Las Vegas Poker N Blackjack, Night Stalker, Pinball, Sea Battle, Shark! Shark!, Sharp Shot, Skiing, Snafu, Soccer, Space Armada, Space Battle, Space Hawk, Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball, Stadium Mud Buggies, Star Strike, Sub Hunt, and Tennis. It would have been nice to see the Dungeons & Dragons games, as well as the Tron games, but licensing issues probably put the kibosh on their inclusion. <P>Aside from the games, there\'s also a collection of short video clips that feature interviews with some of the original programmers. The only other option is the ability to save your game at any time. The Intellivision controller featured a keypad. So, to play this collection on the PlayStation, you must bring the keypad up on your screen, push whatever buttons you need to push, then close the keypad window. The keypad blocks a small portion of the screen, and it\'s generally a big hassle to use, especially in games like Las Vegas Poker N Blackjack, where most of the action takes place on the keypad. <P>A small screen that appears before each game starts quickly informs you of the controls, but it would have been nice also to see some onscreen directions or even scans of the original game manuals. Instead, you\'re forced to flip through the manual and read the usually terrible directions. While the poker and blackjack game has about five pages of directions, Hockey is limited to ""Objective: Score the most points as possible."" Granted, there\'s not a whole lot more you need to know about Hockey other than that objective and the controls, but even to put that in the manual seems totally silly. Also, given the simple nature of these games, there sure is quite a lot of loading involved in getting the games going. <P>If you were an Intellivision owner, and you believe that playing these games on a grossly inadequate controller will bring about pleasant feelings of nostalgia, then this is the package for you.

Sin - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['You are Colonel John R. Blade, who single-handedly restored order to Freeport in 2087, when the police force was dismantled. Now you face a new evil: Elexis Sinclaire has begun to biologically alter the streets of the city. Her mission to create genetically engineered mutants starts with the DNA altering drug, Dyforsanide. Blade uses hard-core weaponry to infiltrate the drug circuit and bring the brilliant biochemist to justice.', ""Sin is for the first-person shooter fan who wants more of the same, done just a little different, but done right. Too bad that's just the sort who'd be especially intolerant of its bugs and occasional shortcomings. Nevertheless, if you're looking for guns, blood, and action, not to mention one of the best deathmatch games of the year, you'll get your money's worth."", ""When it's at its best, Sin looks like a violent comic book or an exploitative action movie. The weapons are high-tech and over-the-top, the women are top-heavy, blood gushes all over the place, and most everything breaks or explodes eventually. As dictionary-definition tough guy John Blade, you must shoot your way through hundreds of gun-toting bruisers and nogoodniks. Sure, they all look the same, but they die in all kinds of different ways. They'll fly backward, spin out, clutch at their throats, clutch at their stomachs, collapse in place, or just plain blow to bits depending on how and where you shoot them. The motion-captured death throes of your enemies always look great, no matter how many you put out of their misery. Not that putting them out of their misery is an easy task; not all these guys know how to shoot straight, but they move pretty fast, and they won't go down easy. Of course, they'll go down a lot easier if you're a good shot - one of the best aspects of Sin is the hit detection, where you can shoot your enemy in any part of his body and see appropriate results. Sure, if you keep shooting that thug in the chest, he'll eventually go down; but even one or two shots to his head will do the job just the same. But don't get smug because the same laws apply to you. A lucky shot could even knock your weapon clean from your grip."", ""Most of the levels are intricately detailed, and some of them look very good. The game is richly colored all the way through, and while certain areas are a bit dark, for the most part, every area of the game looks plausible. While some of the level architecture starts to look a little plain, with too many right angles and too many long corridors, there are enough twists and unique challenges to keep you going and, more importantly, to keep you interested. In a throwback to Duke Nukem 3D, the levels also tend to be highly interactive, more so than the usual shooter. Go on, you know you want to flush those toilets, dial those phones, and open those file cabinets. Its graphics look awkward sometimes, often during the in-game cinematics, but for the most part, Sin's slick."", ""There's a lot of speech in Sin, what with Blade and his sidekick J.C. bantering back and forth all the time. Sure, real people don't talk like that, but the dialogue is appropriate in the context of the game, and for every joke that falls flat, there are at least a couple that work. Unfortunately, for the most part, Sin doesn't sound nearly as good as it should. Enemy thugs mutter the same boring lines over and over, to the point where it's all the more satisfying to shut them up. Most every gun at your disposal looks fantastic, but most every gun sounds meek and weak. It's almost sad - you've got Blade looking like a real tough customer, toting that monster machine gun in one hand and feeding ammo into it with the other, but the thing sounds like an electric razor running low on juice. Meanwhile, you've got an interactive soundtrack buzzing away in the background, and though it'll get you grooving to a good drumbeat once in a while, usually you either won't notice, or you'll want to turn it off."", ""After all, you must concentrate what with so many tough guys trying to lay you low all the time. The action in Sin is a lot of fun, and there's enough variety in between to keep the gunfights interesting. Often times, you must use your ingenuity as well as your ammunition. J.C. will help hack into various computer systems along the way, so you can disable security systems, open doors, and more. Otherwise, sometimes you must be sneaky; other times, you must think fast; and still other times, you must make some serious jumps. There's a lot more variety here than your average shooter, although that's not to suggest Sin is unlike anything you've ever seen."", ""The fact is, at its core, this here's your run-of-the-mill shooter. Unless you think it's a unique or revolutionary development to find the machine gun before the shotgun, you'll traverse familiar territory most of the way through Sin. But who cares? This is the shooter made for diehard fans of the genre, and if that's you, you'll like it a lot. After all, Sin rewards your finely honed aim more than any other Quake-style shooter, and the more experienced you are with the genre, the more you'll enjoy its wisecracks and shooter community in-jokes. On top of that, the single-player game is rather long, and you'll always have the deathmatch mode when you're through."", ""Sin includes many different deathmatch levels, some of which are straightforward but well-designed and some of which are pretty wild. One has you fighting on a moving train, while another puts you in a giant living room. Meanwhile, the hit detection only makes matters more interesting. Even the stock pistol can end a shootout pretty quickly if your aim is remarkable. But you needn't worry about the hit detection ruining deathmatches, with instant-death head shots left and right; Sin moves quickly, and most of the time, you'll have trouble hitting your opponent at all, let alone hitting him in the forehead. And when you need a break from deathmatch, Sin's even got a training facility that lets you skeet shoot with the shotgun, snipe with the rifle, and more; the game even tabulates a score based on your performance."", ""But all this seems practically pointless in light of Sin's bugs. Sure, multiplayer Sin works fine out of the box, but single-player loading times are unacceptable to the point where you'll have plenty of time to wonder if it's worth the trouble. Sin isn't easy, and dying in it starts to feel like a fate worse than death, what with two-minute load times as a consequence of every fatal mistake. And the problems don't stop there. The game's incompatible with certain popular sound cards, not to mention the first boss who stands perfectly still as you shoot him. Certainly, there will be a patch to address these problems. But no one wants a game that doesn't work well out of the box, and it isn't fair to force a customer to download a multimegabyte patch just to justify the purchase (the beta version of the patch is more than 10MB). Activision should be shipping the patch to every registered customer, complete with a rebate and personalized apology. But fat chance that's going to happen. So, for the time being, if you're looking for the best stand-in for Quake this year, you'll find it worth your while to shrug off the bugs. <i>--Greg Kasavin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Battlezone Gold - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The Battlezone is the full moon base established when the real ""Space Race"" began. Space programs launched by both Soviet and American militaries search for valuable bio-metal deposits. Only one country can have control and it is your mission to control the alien technology before they do. Battlezone Gold packs greater fighting power with the inclusion of two mission packs and the official strategy guide.', 'Some folks might accuse Activision of duplicity for naming its newest action/strategy game Battlezone, but aside from the fact that both games put you in the cockpit of a tank, it has about as much in common with that arcade classic as an IBM PC Jr. does with a full-blown Pentium gaming system. <P> Yep, anyone who picks up this Battlezone expecting a graphics-heavy retread of the original will be in for a big surprise - but luckily it\'ll be an extremely pleasant one. Simply put, Battlezone is one of the best strategy games I\'ve wrapped my brain (and trigger finger) around in a long, long time. And I\'ve got three words for anyone who does complain that Activision stuck the Battlezone name on this product just to boost sales: get over it. Hell, I wouldn\'t care if they\'d somehow managed to call it Super Mario\'s Metal Mayhem if it meant more people would be tempted to check it out. <P> Battlezone has the look and feel of a futuristic shooter, but it\'s actually set in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Seems that a meteor shower a decade earlier left behind some other-worldly stuff called ""bio-metal"" - the product of an alien technology that can not only be used to craft weapons of incredible power and durability, but which also seems to be sentient. (Now that would have made a decent Pet Rock!) Uncle Sam wants to use the bio-metal to bring the Cold War to an end, but - you guessed it - the Soviets found out about the bio-metal and are just as desperate as you to get their Commie hands on it first. <P> The quest for the miracle metal leads both nations into space to track down the mother lode - and hopefully uncover any other alien leftovers that could lead to ultimate victory. Beginning on the Earth\'s moon, the Americans and Russkies start to unravel the mysteries behind the bio-metal, leading to a race that takes them from Earth\'s closest planetary neighbors to the harsh worlds of Jupiter\'s moons Io and Titan - and to the realization that they must unite to defeat a force greater than both of them. It\'s a pretty good setup, if for no other reason than it means you get to enjoy seven types of terrain, each with its own distinct look and particular obstacles and hazards. And the narration between missions gives the whole affair a decidedly personal touch (though it does get a bit too melodramatic now and then). <P> But what really makes Battlezone so special is the way it blends the adrenaline rush of first-person action games with the strategy and resource management of Red Alert (or one of its imitators). Sure, you\'ll see plenty of combat from the cockpit of your tank, but personal victories mean little or nothing in the grand scheme of things. At the same time that you\'re on the lookout for roving Russians, you must launch an extensive construction program, starting by guiding your Recycler to a geyser where it can draw power. The Recycler converts scrap metal (collected by Scavengers) that\'s used to build everything from tanks and turrets to factories, armories, and power plants. Once you\'ve manufactured offensive and defensive weapons, they fall under your command: Although the game\'s AI means they\'ll always attack nearby enemies, you\'ll need to give them specific assignments to maximize their firepower and range. If that weren\'t enough, you can jump from your basic tank and hunt down enemies with your plasma rifle or take control of almost any vehicle - from the utilitarian tug to the havoc-wreaking bomber. <P> Not every mission involves constant construction. One mission is a solo outing where you must use a sniper rifle to kill a Soviet pilot and commandeer his ship for a spy run; another actually penalizes you for overbuilding by allowing the Soviets to reach the objective first if you waste time amassing a heavy firepower advantage. For the most part, however, you can expect to be constantly cranking out various units and structures while blasting enemy forces into proverbial space dust. <P> Having this much control laid at your feet could be a major pain in a game using a first-person perspective, but the Battlezone interface is so well designed that after just a few hours of play it\'s as comfortable as a pair of old jeans. With just a little practice you\'ll be able to zoom toward an objective while sending reinforcements to a trouble spot and ordering your Recycler and Factory to keep pumping out units. <P> It\'s hard not to compare the resource-management and construction facets of Battlezone to those in the Command & Conquer games: Recyclers have pretty much the same role as Mobile Construction Vehicles, Scavengers work like Harvesters, Factories produce offensive and defensive units the way War Factories do - well, you get the idea. But hey, if you\'re gonna nick an idea or two from somewhere, those C&C games are a pretty good place to start, especially if you\'re going to give the genre a whole new feel with a first-person interface. And the arsenal of weapons in Battlezone puts it in a class of its own. Howitzers can rain death on enemy bases, targeting guns ""paint"" a target so it can be tracked by guided missiles, Day Wrecker missiles detonate just above ground level with the power of a blockbuster bomb, magnetic ""curtains"" provide temporary invulnerability - all these and more lead to a huge number of tactical possibilities. <P> It\'s been said that you eat with your eyes, and if that cliche holds true for games then Battlezone is a tempting treat indeed. Direct3D support makes for some of the best outdoor terrain and detailed vehicles I\'ve seen in a game, and it\'s topped off with special effects such as fiery explosions, missile trails, thick clouds of haze, lightning bolts, and other visual goodies. This stuff isn\'t just eye candy, either; it all works together to create an intensely immersive experience. There are a few graphical glitches - white dots where textures weren\'t connected and a rapidly jerking plasma rifle are notable examples - but they were so few and far between I hardly gave them a second thought. <P> Not counting the tutorials, the single-player game includes 27 missions - 17 played from the US side and eight as the Soviets. Figuring that most gamers will want to saddle up as the good guys, the American missions progress so that you\'re given more to do as you get acquainted with the game; the Russian missions are supposedly aimed at ""experienced"" commanders, but by the time you\'ve played four or five US missions you should be able to handle at least some of the Soviet outings. <P> There are a couple of cupcake missions, but they\'re compensated for by the inclusion of some real bears. The charm of the mission design, though, is that there\'s rarely a single ""right"" way to do things: Several options are open to you, giving you the chance to choose the one that best suits your skills and style of play. <P> And should you tire of the single-player missions, Battlezone\'s got some extremely intense multiplayer options to keep the good feeling going even longer. The strategy mode (which gives you the same type of control as in the single-player game) provides a distinct experience each time out because there are so many approaches each opponent can take. I really didn\'t expect deathmatch to be as appealing - after all, you just run around and grab power-ups and kill everyone else - but after just a few matches I found myself enjoying it more than I\'d thought possible. There\'s even a map editor to create your own multiplayer arenas. <P> There are two snags: Latency and the fact that you can start games before all players have joined (which gives the early bird a definite advantage in strategy mode). Some players on Activision\'s Battlezone server appeared to be completely oblivious to the concept of high latency, resulting in dropped packets (which means vital stuff like missile hits might not be transmitted), so if you do play on the server, you probably should start a game and only allow players with latencies below 500ms to join. <P> Battlezone is dotted with a few minor blemishes. Perhaps most noticeable is that the AI for friendly units can be a little dicey: Scavengers will sometimes stop their task and park outside Recyclers, for instance, and some offensive units aren\'t smart enough to follow a Recycler you\'re relocating if you told them to defend it while it was stationary. There\'s no way to order a scout or tank to follow a scavenger, tug, or transport unless the unit to be escorted is within your targeting range; there should be a way to assign an escort to any unit regardless of its location. <P> Control can be a bit of a problem for mousers - I couldn\'t find any way to increase the speed at which I turned left and right using the mouse, and the cursor was a bit floaty for me. Finally, the addition of a coordinate system would allow you to send units anywhere on the map; as it stands, you can only send them to Nav beacons, construction units, or a place you designate with the aiming reticle. <P> So how critical are these problems? I\'ll put it like this: Ninety percent of the reason I mentioned them is because that\'s my job, not because they bothered me much when I was playing. And I\'m not saying that as a sop to Activision, or anyone else for that matter; I\'m saying it because it\'s the truth. <P> Listen, I see games every day; it\'s what I do for a living. When I load one up and start raving about it to all my friends after a few hours of play, I know I\'ve got the real deal on my hands - and that\'s just what Battlezone is. This might be the most perfect blend of two gaming genres since... well, I don\'t know when.1998 might be only three months old, but it\'s going to take a lot of effort for someone to crank out a better action/strategy game than Battlezone.<I>--Stephen Poole</I> <P> --<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

He never bothered anyone, and he never wanted to be a hero. Suddenly, an army of the undead, led by Necros, destroyed Drake's village. Unable to do anything, Drake left the ruins of the village and became a merchant. Several years later, while selling swords and shields, Drake gets caught in the Crusade, an uprising of noble spirits who are out to destroy Necros and his army of the undead. Take control of Drake as he joins the Crusade. Run, jump and climb through 3D environments as Drake destroys Necros's legions with swords, axes, maces, and a little magic. Will Drake survive to fight Necros, or will he try to leave the Crusade at his first opportunity? Play CRUSADERS OF MIGHT AND MAGIC and discover what happens."", ""Don't you hate it when monsters storm your village, kill your family, and leave you for dead? Well, if you own a PlayStation and don't mind a little role-playing action, you can exact revenge on those bony freaks. In 3DO's Crusaders of Might and Magic, you star as Drake, a hardened hero with a flair for magic and a penchant for butt-kicking. Suckered by the fair Celestia into ridding the land of Necros' undead legions, you'll travel back and forth across nine areas of dank forests, majestic castles, and depressing dungeons. Whether you're in the oppressive stronghold, the majestic citadel, or on glistening glaciers, you'll encounter quirky villagers, macho guards, and a near-limitless cadre of vile demons. At its core, Crusaders of Might and Magic is a 3D action role-playing game, akin to a fantasy version of Soul Reaver. As Drake, you can run, jump, climb, attack, and dole out magic like it's going out of style. Most of the time, you'll be running about swinging your weapon at enemies, acquiring items, or yapping with the locals. To even up the odds, a variety of swords, axes, maces, and other handheld attack accoutrements are at your disposal. You've also got plenty of shields, spells, and assorted healing potions to support your endeavors. As the game progresses, you'll acquire even better weapons and more spells, while continually increasing your experience and stamina levels. The monsters you face have vulnerability to or strengths againstcertain weapons and spells, further contributing to the game's lasting appeal. Survive through to the end of the crusade, and a satisfying battle with Necros awaits, provided you can defeat the sheer number of demons the last few levels throw at you. Though Necros' henchmen are no slouches in the difficulty department, the game's control system is actually the greatest learning curve that prospective players must surpass. Indeed, it is somewhat of a bear to switch weapons or items during the heat of combat, since hitting select, then X, then left or right, then select again is a pain to do hundreds of times, especially when you've got ten shields and 30 spells weighing you down. Still, it's no worse than the submenu systems of Resident Evil or Tomb Raider. If you can see past this solitary quibble, the fighting system is enjoyable, and exploration is easy enough. Furthermore, who doesn't want to go around brutalizing the undead with a weapon called Divine Justice? Visually, Crusaders of Might and Magic serves up the goods in a crisp, clean, and refined way. Corridors, dungeons, forests, and castles are all well detailed, replete with torches, tapestries, vines, and a plethora of other interior-decorating niceties. The polygonal character models are, for the most part, exceptional, with a believable level of animation. Loose-fitting clothes flap in the breeze, swords emit sparks on impact, and enemies even hunch over in pain as your fireballs of death implode their insufficient chest cavities. When you find yourself approximately 30 minutes into the game and notice the gleam off the captain's sword, you too will be at least somewhat impressed. There are minor amounts of texture-warping and clipping issues here and there, but no more than those found in Soul Reaver or Shadowman. The game's sound is also above average, delivering the type of experience that fantasy fans eat up. The music is both enchanting and varied, leaving little room for complaint. There's a decent mix of classically orchestral and New Age-style music, which adds to the game's somewhat medieval appeal. Weapon sounds are also exceptional, varying in both pitch and timbre, depending on where and what they impact. Even more impressive are the grunts, growls, and guttural utterances the Legion monsters produce - so scary that even Resident Evil fanatics will take notice. Like a cherry on top, there's also plenty of character-interaction speech, which furthers the game's intricate plot while breaking up the monotony of exploration. Admittedly, Crusaders of Might and Magic isn't the best role-playing game nor the best 3D adventure title. However, it represents an ample merger of the two genres, aiming to please those who desire both plot and variety in their dungeon adventures. While those burned out on games such as Tomb Raider, Soul Reaver, and Shadow Man may want to steer clear, those looking for an engrossing RPG experience and a good 3D adventure may want to check out Crusaders of Might and Magic.  [Editor's Note: Contrary to what you may have heard out there on the Web, the final version of Crusaders of Might and Magic is not a buggy, crash-laden piece of software.

Enemy Engaged: Apache vs Havoc,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['About: East meets West in an apocalyptic clash of the superpowers as the US Apache Longbow and the Russian Havoc go head to head in the most incredible helicopter sim ever seen on a PC. Easily accessible yet deeply challenging gameplay, an intense and absorbing atmosphere and super- fast speeds make the Apache Havoc an amazing flying experience. Try two fully simulated combat helicopters: the US AH64D Apache Longbow and Russian Mil-28N Havoc B. Enjoy three vast combat zones featuring countless missions and dynamic campaigns in highly detailed and articulated 3D models and authentic flight dynamics.', 'If you take a look at combat helicopter sims, you have two fairly distinct categories. On the one hand, you have Longbow 2, a hard-core sim of the highest order that comes replete with excellent realism, top-notch graphics, and a relatively steep learning curve. On the other hand, you have games like Comanche 3 and Team Apache, which sacrifice varying degrees of realism in favor of fast-paced, easier gameplay and (in the case of Team Apache at least) multiplayer action. Now, along comes Apache Havoc, from Empire Interactive and Razorworks Studios. Where does this two-in-one sim fall along the spectrum of helicopter sims? Right smack in the middle. <P> Apache Havoc offers a great mix of realism and approachability, so that hard-core fans and novices alike should find a lot to like in the game. Not only do you get to fly either the AH-64D Apache Longbow or the Mil Mi-28 Havoc B, but you also get to take part in three different dynamic campaigns as well as some memorable multiplayer airborne deathmatches. <P> The game does not include an instant-action feature per se, but you can take off for free flights, dynamic missions, dynamic campaigns, or multiplayer missions (co-op or competitive). Free flight is a good place to start for novices, as the game\'s flight engine is reasonably accurate and therefore requires some practice to master. Most of the individual realism settings (wind, retreating blade stall, and ground effect, among others) can be dialed up or down to accommodate your skill and preference. Also, the game includes a basic three-level difficulty setting that affects the overall challenge of the missions and campaigns. <P> The campaigns in Apache Havoc take place in three global hot spots: Cuba, the former Russian state of Georgia, and the ""Golden Triangle"" of Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos. Each campaign is dynamic and somewhat reminiscent of EF-2000 and F-22 Total Air War. The unique twist to Apache Havoc\'s campaigns is that you begin with only one and a half hours on the campaign clock. That clock ticks down as you fly missions - you gain some time if you accomplish a mission, and you lose extra time when you fail (extra, meaning time beyond what you spent trying to accomplish the mission). When you run out of time, the campaign is over, and whichever side is closest to its objective goals wins. A clock may not be the most exciting of motivators, but it works well in Apache Havoc. <P> One thing I didn\'t much like about the early stages of each campaign (dynamic or not) was that the missions are all pretty dry. Recon, scout, and combat air patrol are the rule of the day, and for a while these missions tend to come up empty in terms of targets, let alone excitement of any kind. Even worse, when you complete some of the basic scout missions, the computer maps an insanely long return route to a base several map grids away. The result is not only a boring mission, but also a very, very long boring mission. The ""skip ahead"" feature from F-22 Total Air War would be welcome in Apache Havoc. Still, once the campaign heats up a bit and you complete some of the simpler hops, you\'ll have better missions to fly. <P> While the graphics in Apache Havoc are not quite up to the sheer beauty of Longbow 2 on all fronts, they are exceptionally good. The unit models in particular are excellent and highly detailed, and the weather and weapons effects border on spectacular. Also, the level of detail on the ground is fantastic - particularly on airfields, where you can see all the other aircraft and support equipment. The terrain can be a bit uninspiring at altitude, but you\'re not really supposed to be up that high anyway (this is an attack helicopter remember). Once you\'re down near the ground, following rivers and popping up over tree lines, the terrain quality becomes very immersive. <P> The trees themselves are a touch disappointing, though, since they\'re just blocks of space with treelike textures on them. And the colors can be a bit garish at times, but otherwise the game looks great. This is especially true at high resolution (the game runs as high as 1280x1024). Unfortunately, the developers created cockpit graphics for 640x480 only. For invisible cockpit fans like me, this is no big deal, but if you like to keep the cockpit graphics on while flying, the ridiculously small, floating 640x480 cockpit on your 1024x768 screen might prove annoying. Also, Apache Havoc can be a brutish resource hog - even on a Pentium II 450 with 128MB RAM and dual Voodoo2 cards, the game chugged whenever I flew over an area with lots of buildings or ships. <P> The music in Apache Havoc is techno-pop, which seems out of place but quickly fades to repetitive background noise after a few minutes. The sound effects, on the other hand, can be remarkable. Though the radio chatter is jerky and occasionally cryptic, the vehicle sounds are excellent. Flying low over a patch of trees looking for a column of enemy armor (which seemed to be actively trying to hide from me), I actually heard the tank treads below before I could spot the individual tanks. Can you really hear tanks from inside an Apache cockpit? I have no idea, but it was damn cool in the game. <P> Apache Havoc is a good all-around sim that impresses despite its odd assortment of quirks. While the game is unlikely to make Longbow 2 devotees drop the Jane\'s classic, it is a solid addition to the genre. <i>--Michael E. Ryan</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Heavy Gear 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Your unit is to be transported to the planet Caprice, the base of the enemy. Practice espionage and gain intelligence on weaponry and counter tactics. You are one of the finest warriors in history and your Gear equipment echoes that fact. Prove your bravery as you advance behind enemy lines to prevent future extraplanetary invasions of Terra Nova.', ""So what if it lost FASA's Battletech license. That didn't stop Activision from turning out another MechWarrior game, albeit disguised under a new brand name. Heavy Gear, based on Dream Pod 9's rival anime-inspired giant robot pen-and-paper RPG, looks, sounds, and plays much like Activision's popular MechWarrior games, putting you in command of a powerful mobile suit loaded with devastating weapons and thick armor plating. Heavy Gear should have been an all-new game; Gears are much smaller than Mechs, standing a mere four meters in height on the average. They're supposed to be fast and agile, limited only by the flexibility and speed of their human pilots. But in Activision's game, you become a slave to the war machine you thought was yours to command, much how you might have felt in MechWarrior 2. <P> Heavy Gear looks sharp at first glance. Each Gear is rendered in careful detail and textured in dark camouflage, lending these massive mobile suits a look even better than their distant BattleMech cousins. Also gone is the flat, lifeless terrain of MechWarrior 2, replaced this time with rolling hills and plenty of boulders, cacti, and other such obstacles that can be used as cover in the heat of battle. At the same time, 3D accelerator owners can take advantage of enhanced frame rates and special effects including flowing clouds, lighting, and transparent shadows. But with or without a 3D accelerator, you'll certainly appreciate the unobtrusive green heads-up display, which readily displays your status and weapons loadout while outlining your target in color-coded wire frame to show how much damage he's sustained, and where. <P> Unfortunately, further investigation yields that the graphics could have fared considerably better. For one thing, in spite of the varied topography, a Gear always looks like it's walking straight ahead - even as it scales a near-vertical hillside. This effect is more disorienting than, say, the pixelated, bland-looking explosions that further detract from the game's aesthetic value. Moreover, the effects of your Gear's various weapon systems look plain and, at best, leave much to the imagination. <P> Thankfully, Heavy Gear's audio doesn't suffer the same faults as its visuals. From the bass-heavy stomping of your Gear's legs as it rushes into battle to the metal-on-metal clank of your rifle shots tearing into the enemy, you'll get a good feel for the combat through Heavy Gear's sound. All the while, a stirring, percussion-heavy synth-orchestral soundtrack adds that epic feel to each and every battle. But strangely enough, this soundtrack sounds rather like the scores that added so much atmosphere to MechWarrior 2 and Mercenaries. This big nod to Activision's previous future simulators turns out to be only the first of many. <P> For all intents and purposes, Heavy Gear plays just like MechWarrior 2. Mech veterans will have an easy time making the switch over to Gears, what with no longer having to worry about overheating or any such complications. Otherwise, even though Gears are supposed to be many times more maneuverable than Mechs, Heavy Gear feels almost as lethargic as did the Mech games at their worst. Other opportunities to capitalize on the smaller, faster humanoid Gear design were likewise passed up. A Gear can only carry a single handheld gun while the other arm dangles uselessly at its side; close-range melee weapons, which appear in the pen-and-paper RPG, are conspicuously absent. Gears can crouch, but they need to come to a dead halt first, which is a lot more trouble than it's worth most of the time. Likewise, Gears can sidestep, but this is only a trivial addition considering they can twist 180 degrees at the torso. Other elements of gameplay fare better; for instance, you can pick up spare weapons from the battlefield should yours run out of ammo. Each Gear has wheels, letting you move quickly from point to point or escape from battle in a pinch. Gears also have their own AI, which means you learn enhanced abilities as you progress through the game. A powerful blow will knock a Gear clean off its feet, leaving it vulnerable until it manages to clamber back to a standing position. <P> Heavy Gear offers two well-designed solo play modes, the first being a linear story composed of nearly three dozen missions. The story unfolds through beautifully rendered cutscenes in between missions and over radio communication during the missions themselves. The missions continue to surprise and contain enough variety to hold interest through to the story's conclusion. Throughout these missions, the computer-controlled opponents will have you outnumbered - but probably not outclassed. The AI has a bad habit of shooting straight at you rather than leading its shots, making torso-twist strafing runs unusually effective. And while the AI deserves a bit of praise for trying to use cover to its advantage, you'll be hard pressed to stifle a chuckle the first time you see an opposing Gear blow itself up by walking into a boulder. Nevertheless, the computer will provide a competent challenge if only because of its superior numbers, especially since you can't rely on your inept squad mates to get you out of a pinch. Even when you finish with the story mode, you'll find plenty to like in the less structured but equally enjoyable tour-of-duty game, which allows you to handpick your missions as you rise through the ranks on either side of a civil war. This mode offers a vast scope of the conflict as one side gradually takes the advantage over supplies, intelligence, and sheer numbers. But before you leap headlong into warfare, you'll want to run through the helpful training exercises, which will whip you into fighting shape within an hour or so. <P> After winning your virtual war, you'll probably want to try your skills against your friends. Fortunately, Heavy Gear comes equipped with Internet multiplayer support right out of the box. Unfortunately, Activision makes it little secret that Heavy Gear's Internet play option is in an unfinished beta form. Glitches and crashes abound both in the menu screen and during actual multiplayer gameplay, though you'll probably get a game going with a little perseverance. Promises of a patch don't change the fact that an important component of this product was allowed to ship in an incomplete form, no doubt to make the Christmas rush. At least Heavy Gear's solo play modes don't suffer from the same glaring hang-ups. <P> With the exception of its lacking originality, Heavy Gear contains all the elements of a successful game and is certainly the finest game of its kind in many months. Of course, it's also the only game of its kind to be published in many months, which makes it a definite buy for those yearning for more giant robots since last year's Mercenaries. Its similarities to MechWarrior 2 and Mercenaries ensure that fans of those games will also enjoy Heavy Gear. At the same time, its similarities represent a missed opportunity to create an all-new product centered around a new kind of vehicle design. Instead, Heavy Gear feels very derivative right down to its soundtrack and ironic intro, with only a handful of new gameplay features on top of a superior story mode and the enjoyable tour of duty. Heavy Gear will keep most mech sim fans busy for a good while, much of which will be spent wondering why it didn't have the courage to break from its roots. <i>--Greg Kasavin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

But <i>South Park</i> fans are sure to fall in swee-e-et luv with this game.  <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", ""The Luv Shack is a little old place where we can get together. OK, now that the token B-52's reference is out of the way, South Park: Chef's Luv Shack is a loose combination of You Don't Know Jack-style trivia and Mario Party-style minigames. The result is a game that manages to amuse with its questions, but the lame minigames, lack of varied speech, and generally slow pace of the game make it short-lived fun at best. The game is set up like a game show hosted by everyone's favorite chef, Chef. Chef offers the player in control a choice in three trivia categories. The categories manage to be pretty funny, with topics like Sucks or Canadian, Giant Japanese Monster Bad, The 1991 Denver Broncos, and West Siyeeeeede Story. The questions are occasionally funny (for instance: The rock band Loverboy: Sucks, or Canadian? The correct answer is, of course, both), but after two or three days you'll start to see some questions repeated. Speaking of repeating, the game's speech gets old pretty fast. It uses all the real voices, but there isn't enough variation. The game's intro is the same every time, the announcer says the same things, etc. A few different intros and quick jokes would have gone a long way here. The load times are brief, but they really break up what should be a fast-paced trivia game. Having to wait between questions and minigame rounds really has a noticeable effect on the overall flow of the game. The minigames are extremely basic, some taking on elements of classic arcade games like Asteroids, Warlords, Super Sprint, Tapper, and Kickman. Others are oriented toward button mashing. After seeing each of the minigames once, you'll probably wish there were a way to disable them altogether. The trivia and the game's warped sense of humor are the main draws here, and the minigames really take away from the overall presentation. Graphically, the game looks just as you would expect it to. The simple style of the South Park characters is well represented, albeit a little on the pixilated side, and the animation closely mirrors the show, even in the minigame rounds. This is a game that you may want to rent, but the repeating questions, repeating speech, and dull minigames keep it from being a game you'd want to pop in whenever you need a simple party-style game.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Yet this third outing for Jordan Mechner's swashbuckling hero has two tragic flaws, and these problems are so overwhelming that the good parts seem wasted."", 'The previous two Prince of Persia games, the first from 1989 and its sequel The Shadow and the Flame from 1993, were both side-scrolling action games. In them, you controlled the prince as he climbed ledges, fought guards, and jumped over and crawled under traps, all in search of his beloved and imprisoned fiance. Prince of Persia 3D follows this formula exactly, only this time the game is in 3D, and the prince and his princess are married. But once again, the prince has been imprisoned and left for dead, and he must escape the clutches of the villain and rescue his fair maiden.', ""That Prince of Persia 3D is essentially a three-dimensional version of its predecessors is no criticism. In fact, the trap-jumping, guard-fighting gameplay of the original translates nicely to 3D, and the best part of the game is how effectively it utilizes these elements. Only a handful of games have so successfully created the feeling that you are capable of such daring feats. During the course of the game, you'll find yourself swinging from ropes across wide chasms, leaping off high ledges to slide down rising drawbridges, and other exciting stunts."", ""The excellent level design in Prince of Persia 3D makes such stunts commonplace. The game is well paced; it has just enough enemies so combat doesn't get tedious, enough exciting moments to make you want to keep playing, and enough puzzles to keep things interesting in between. The levels also look quite stunning and are filled with big, exotic architecture and wondrous gadgets and machinery."", ""But while the levels themselves look great, the characters that populate them don't. That's not to say they look bad (except in the cutscenes, in which the disproportional bodies and strange faces of the characters can look downright ugly), but they don't look particularly special either. The motion-captured animation looks great, except when the prince runs up stairs or ramps, at which point he looks like an old man who just doesn't have it in him anymore. Then again, it's been ten years since he first took to adventuring, so perhaps we should give him a break."", ""The inconsistent visuals would be easier to ignore if the game didn't have more serious problems. The game's worst flaw is its sluggish and unresponsive control. Turning the prince while running feels like trying to steer an 18-wheeler. He turns wide, which makes running around corners a chore. And the game often won't respond to two commands at once, so that actions such as drawing your weapon or simply jumping while running are far more difficult than they should be."", ""The perspective is almost as problematic. The camera stays at a fixed point behind the prince, and only occasionally adjusts itself to clear objects and obstructions. You can control the camera Tomb Raider-style if you stand still and manipulate it manually. But that doesn't help when your back is against a wall and you're trying to make a difficult jump while the camera is showing you in close-up profile. Such situations are all too common in Prince of Persia 3D."", ""During combat, the camera angle is less of an issue because the perspective switches to a side view when your weapon is drawn, and while this feature is helpful, it too produces its share of annoyances. You can't turn while your weapon is drawn, which makes lining up with an enemy difficult. Thankfully, enemies will run up and get in position for a fight, but often you'll just start swinging wildly while they bash away at you. Then again, this problem goes both ways; your enemies will just as often not be able to hit you while you whack away at them with impunity."", 'Prince of Persia 3D would have been amazing had it been more refined in certain specific areas. The quality of the levels will more than likely make you want to keep playing despite its flaws, but these flaws will be a constant source of dismay for anyone who just wants to enjoy jumping and slashing around in the otherwise well designed world. <i>--Ron Dulin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Driver - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""GT Interactive's new game, <i>Driver</i>, puts gamers right into the middle of the action and squarely behind the wheel of the most wanted getaway car. Assuming the identity of an undercover cop named Tanner, players sell their services as drivers-for-hire to the highest bidder in order to infiltrate a powerful crime ring spanning four of the nation's largest cities--New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Miami. <i>Driver</i> delivers the clutch-your-seats, adrenaline-charged action of a Hollywood-style car chase, propelling players along a high-speed, all-out thrill ride. <i>Driver's</i> true-to-life modeling of automobile physics, ultra-realistic environments, cutting-edge graphics, and revolutionary replay mode allow users to experience an elaborate, realistic interactive driving experience."", ""Like many console-to-PC ports, Driver suffers from being translated verbatim and taking little advantage of the more powerful PC platform. However, Driver's core game design is so strikingly original and fun that it can be enjoyed without embellishment. <P> As its name implies, Driver is a game about driving - at dangerous speeds through densely populated city streets. The game was designed by the makers of the Destruction Derby series and casts you as an undercover 1970s policeman motoring your way into the heart of mob territory through the criminal application of your cop-honed driving skills. Rather than focussing on racing as in Microsoft's recent city-cruising game Midtown Madness, Driver is all about the interactive re-creation of classic car-chase movies like Bullitt and Freebie and the Bean. Pursuit, evasion, survival, and the judicious implementation of all-out vehicular mayhem compose the core of the action. <P> Most car games that dispense with racing replace it with predictable hood-mounted gunplay. Not so with Driver: You pilot an array of big bazooka-less American muscle cars that belch exhaust and run great on regular gas - the most dangerous thing shooting out of these wheeled hellhounds is an illegal mix of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon pollutants. To succeed in Driver, you must master the art of driving like a maniac with precision and control. <P> Those skills are developed in Driver's main game, a mission-based trek through the streets of Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York. The missions are presented as job offers left on an answering machine in a three-dimensional rendering of your character's sleazy apartment, which also acts as the in-game option screen. Your car has two basic attributes: damage and felony. Damage is simply a reverse life bar - when it reaches its upper limit, the car is trashed and the mission ends in failure. Felony is a measurement of police interest in your current activities. It increases if any police cruiser witnesses your vehicle operating illegally. As it rises, the cops will begin to actively pursue you, eventually taking such drastic measures as establishing roadblocks and calling in reinforcements. This gauge introduces a rather original play concept: To win, you must sometimes drive within the limits of the law. Crawling through a busy intersection at a soul-deadening speed while making a rare appearance on the correct side of the road and hoping to God the cop stopped at the light doesn't notice the black smoke pouring out of your crumpled hood is an exciting experience unique to Driver. <P> You'll also enjoy discovering the many creative ways in which Reflections has used the relatively simple components of its gameworld to concoct a wide variety of interesting scenarios. The missions range from timed trips across town, aggressive pursuits of other vehicles, and eluding the fuzz, to unusual and surprising tasks such as scaring the hell out of an informant by taking him on a wild ride, and sending a message to another gang by smashing through the plate-glass windows of its legitimate businesses. Saving the game is only permitted between missions, but it's a testament to the game's success that this fact never becomes a liability. Playing Driver is such great fun and the levels are designed with enough common-sense brevity that restarting a mission almost never becomes frustrating. Car physics are definitely more arcade-like than realistic, but they make for a thrilling mix of impossible, hubcap-flinging turns and stomach-dropping jumps, especially when careening through the streets of San Francisco. <P> Once you've completed the game's nearly 50 missions, you can keep yourself occupied with Driver's skills-testing bonus games. Seven are included, the best being survival, in which you must escape a pack of kamikaze police cruisers for as long as possible. Even with an entire city to drive through, the cops are incredibly difficult to elude. But for the average minute, or the extraordinary two minutes, that it takes them to capture you, it's a real blast. Better yet, true to Driver's cinematic roots, a full replay facility is available, complete with a wide variety of camera placement features. <P> Although undeniably enjoyable, Driver isn't without noticeable flaws. The graphics are good but not up to the standard set by Midtown Madness. The cities are somewhat blocky, and the building textures are often blurry and repetitive. The soundtrack is forgettable, generic '70s funk, and the in-game movies are pretty awful. Driver's mission-loading times, though not unbearable, actually seem to be longer than on the console version. Restarting a mission on the PlayStation was an instantaneous process, but on the PC, the level must be reloaded from scratch. Finally, aside from some graphical enhancements, nothing significant has been added to the game since its console debut. Most sorely missing is any kind of multiplayer mode. <P> However, none of these drawbacks should deter you from picking up Driver. It is addictive, intuitive, and fun, which are qualities sometimes overlooked in the industry's myopic pursuit of purely technical innovation. With Driver, Reflections has produced the definitive re-creation of the classic urban car-chase movie and has quite possibly introduced a new genre of driving game.<I>--Erik Wolpaw</I> <P> --<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Set eight years prior to its predecessor's narrative, the creepy story introduces a new main  character, Cornell, a young gent who moonlights as a werewolf. Dracula's posse has kidnapped Cornell's  younger sister, and the man-wolf must conquer a collection of enemies, including Dracula himself, to save  her. In addition to Cornell's quest, players can experience entirely unique adventures from the viewpoint of  three other characters, adding to the game's replayability."", 'With a slicker version of its precursor\'s game engine, <i>Legacy of Darkness</i> features improved graphics  (bumped up even a few more notches via an optional high-resolution <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001WRIU/${0}"">expansion pack</a>) and redesigned puzzles and levels.  Players navigate using a variety of gymnastic-style moves in the third person, with the camera following  them from an over-the-shoulder view.', 'This game is definitely best enjoyed after a garlic-heavy dinner with the lights off and doors locked.', '<i>--Eric Twelker</i>', ""Once titled - more accurately - Castlevania: Special Edition, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness is what Konami's first Nintendo 64 Castlevania title was meant to be when it was released early this year. Everything from Castlevania 64 is present here in an enhanced director's cut version, which contains improved graphics, sound, and two extra scenarios featuring the new characters, Cornell the werewolf and the young warrior Henry. Like the original, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness isn't very similar to Symphony of the Night on the PlayStation but is a hard-core version of the early titles in the series set in 3D. Taking place eight years before the first N64 game, C:LOD begins with Cornell journeying to Transylvania after his friend Ortega had betrayed him, allowing Cornell's sister Ada to be abducted by Count Dracula. Now it's up to you to rescue her, or die trying.  Instead of letting you play as any of the four characters from the start, C:LOD forces you to finish the game as Cornell before you can unlock the remaining three. As Cornell, you play through a mix of all-new levels and levels from the original that now carry different objectives. Cornell uses a sonic-boom-like punch as his primary weapon, and for close combat, he can use his claws to slash enemies. The weapons are pretty much the same as those found throughout the series: axes, daggers, crosses, holy water, and so on. Cornell himself is a little bit tougher to maneuver than Reinhardt or Carrie, because his lock-on is not as precise as theirs, and his attack is a bit slow. You'll end up facing in one direction for a few seconds while enemies attack you from behind and from the side. Cornell has the ability to morph into werewolf form, which makes his attacks and defenses stronger, but, disappointingly, there are no additional special moves. This new scenario is a lot of fun to explore, although, admittedly, it does seem to drag at points. Playing through Reinhardt's and Carrie's scenarios in the director's cut version isn't nearly as fresh an experience as playing as Cornell, but hard-core fans of the series will nevertheless enjoy playing through these now-more-difficult scenarios, with their new levels and bosses. Henry's mission is the shortest and least interesting of them all, requiring you to rescue seven children within six days.  The graphics found in Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness are a mixed bag. The game looks much more impressive with the use of the N64 Expansion Pak, but even with the Expansion Pak the frame rate is still very jittery, making it almost unplayable. Without the Expansion Pak, the game looks slightly better than the original. A few touchups have been made to the backgrounds, such as added textures to the walls and added details to the flowers in the gardens. Although it may downgrade the resolution, playing without the Expansion Pak makes the game run much smoother. It's a shame that Konami couldn't use the pak more effectively. Many complained about the lack of music in the original, but Legacy of Darkness contains a nice assortment of new tracks and remixes of classic Castlevania tunes. Other additions include the introduction of cinematics and the option to switch the camera into several different modes. Cornell's intro sequence isn't FMV but an in-game engine cinematic, the likes of which was missing in the original. It's not quite up to what Konami accomplished in Metal Gear Solid, of course, but it's entertaining, and it adds a little flavor to the character. You can now also change the game camera between three different perspectives. But there isn't one view that works well for every situation, and you have to keep switching between them to find the best view of the current action. For example, setting the camera to boss mode will place it so far back that your view is often blocked by a wall in areas inside the castle. Complaints aside, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness is exactly what it sets out to be: a better version of the original. If you loved the first one, there's enough added value to justify picking this game up, even though it feels a little dated now, and its price is pretty steep. But if you're one of those people who felt that Castlevania should've never made the jump into 3D, Legacy of Darkness will do only a little more than the original in convincing you otherwise.<i>--Ike Sato</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

Konami Arcade Classics,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Showcasing 10 Konami arcade games from the early to mid-1980s, this collection is a must-have for fans of the originals. Included here are arcade-perfect translations of <i>Pooyan</i>,  <i>Scramble</i>, <i>Yie Ar Kung Fu</i>, <i>Roc\'n\'Rope</i>, <i>Shao Lin\'s Road</i>, <i>Circus  Charlie</i>, <i>Super Cobra</i>, <i>Road Fighter</i>, <i>Time Pilot</i>, and <i>Gyrus</i>. While these  games aren\'t as well known as 1980s classics by Atari and Namco (think <i>Asteroids</i> and  <i>Pac-Man</i>), they are by no means second-rate. In fact, <i>Konami Arcade Classics</i> surpasses  similar collections by Atari and Namco in terms of bang for your buck, with only 2 of its 10 ""hits""  (<i>Shao Lin\'s Road</i> and <i>Road Fighter</i>) being duds.', ""While the games' graphics and sounds are obviously dated, the gameplay here is just as addictive as it was  in its day. In addition to standard retro video game package features such as a short animated movie intro  and brief background history, <i>Konami Arcade Classics</i> is vibration function-enhanced. Even  without this feature, a dual shock controller is recommended, as its analog stick is much truer to an arcade  joystick than using the standard directional buttons. <i>--Joe Hon</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b>', '', 'Konami has jumped on the classic-gaming bandwagon with a collection of its old arcade titles. The collection is a relatively low-frills compilation, but the quality of the games more than makes up for a deficiency in the history department. Most of the games in this collection are standouts. Who can forget great games like Yie Ar Kung Fu, Time Pilot, Scramble, Super Cobra, and Gyruss? The collection also includes some slightly lesser-known games, namely Pooyan, Circus Charlie, Shao-Lin\'s Road, Roc \'N Rope, and Road Fighter. All the games control very well, giving you the option of using the digital pad or the analog stick, though considering that all of these games used digital control in the arcade, there\'s no real advantage to using the analog control. The games make pretty good use of the vibration feature on the Dual Shock pad, which is a nice update that doesn\'t get in the way of the retro experience. The graphics are identical to those in the arcade games, though many of the scores and little things - like the fuel meter in Scramble and Super Cobra - have been moved to the right side of the screen to better preserve the original resolution. The sound is also identical to that of the original versions. A small history section that includes the games\' US release dates and a brief paragraph about each game rounds out the package. Also, the games load up with a coin already in each of them, so you never see any of the attract modes. Since this prevents you from seeing the message ""Invade the base and carry away booty"" in Super Cobra, it\'s a little disappointing. But if you hold any of these games (Yie Ar Kung Fu and Time Pilot are my personal faves) in high regard, you\'ll find that they still play well with a PlayStation controller, and this package is definitely worth picking up.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

Soul Of The Samurai,,"['1 player, for mature audience']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Faithfully designed to re-create the atmosphere of medieval Japan and the  actual movements of ninja and samurai, <i>Soul of the Samurai</i> is graphically  beautiful and lots of fun. By combining blocking moves with strikes and utilizing various  special moves, your character is able to move through the 3-D environment with realistic  speed and skill. Students of sword fighting will especially enjoy some of the moves.', 'At the start of the game you have the choice of playing either the male ronin (a samurai  without a master) Kotaro or the female ninja Lin. Lin is very fast and does moderate  damage, while Kotaro sometimes kills with one hit but is rather slow.

Instead, the joy of the game is found in the amazing fight sequences and the ease with  which one can master control of either character within these sequences.', 'As you advance though levels, you can save games by writing haiku poetry, and you can  acquire healing herbs and better weapons.

But those looking for a ninja game of Tenchu\'s caliber will unfortunately have to keep on looking. <P>In fact, Soul of the Samurai has much more in common with Capcom\'s Resident Evil series than anything else. The premise sets you as one of two warriors (the masterless samurai Kotaro and female ninja Lin) who set out to stop an evil warlord from turning the local townsfolk into zombies for the undead army he plans to march against the shogun. The environments are made of static 3D backgrounds viewed from a preset, three-quarter overhead perspective. And instead of filing police reports RE-style - on a typewriter -to save your game, your character compiles a haiku. Seriously. The parallels are there, albeit, oddly through the looking glass. <P>The main problem with SOTS is the same one that Tenchu had: The combat is difficult because of the camera. While Tenchu makes up for the flaw by rewarding you for not getting into fights, SOTS requires you to battle. In fact, it demands so much hacking and slashing that it starts to feel like a mindless arcade-style beat \'em up like Eidos\' Fighting Force. The control commands include jump, slash, guard, draw/put away weapon, and you use items like throwing stars and bombs. Special moves can be pulled off by executing various combinations of slash and guard while maneuvering the directional pad, but mashing on the attack button appears to work best, and this actually lets you perform one of the specials on its own.  <P>The guard command also works to lock in on an enemy as in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\'s Z-targeting function, only not nearly as elegantly. One reason for the shortcoming is that the environments are small and don\'t allow much room to move about and dodge attacks, but mainly it\'s because the camera angles make it hard to see which enemy you\'re lined up against. This is compounded by the fact that multiple enemies will attack at once - instead of the less realistic but more playable ""oh, my turn"" approach found in many similar games. You might be battling two enemies on a narrow path, and while you\'re blocking a blow by one of them, the other will likely rain an attack on you from behind. The game starts off extremely easy, but sections like this soon make it needlessly difficult.  <P>The positive side of SOTS is the story, which is told through the use of in-game engine sequences and subtitles. Instead of being broken up into different levels, the game is set in chapters. While the tale is fairly wooden and telegraphs its punches a mile away at times, the delivery is unique and often actually realizes the gaming clich&#xE9; of ""making you feel like part of the story."" If there were less filler battles and a better camera set-up, SOTS would be much more fun to play. In the end, the game is more of a curiosity rental than a title you\'d want to pick up for keeps. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

And don't forget, the object is to unite Europe under one flag--yours!"", 'Imperialism was a bit of a surprise. A low-key, visually stylish economic and military conquest game, it didn\'t have much flash, but it had good gameplay in the Civilization/Railroad Tycoon mold. <P> Imperialism II sticks close to its roots. The maps and unit graphics are virtually identical to the first, and the fundamental gameplay is very similar. The main change is in the setting. Instead of playing as a robber baron in the age of industry, you play as a conqueror in the age of exploration. Those are two very different milieus for a strategy game, which helps make this feel like a true sequel rather than an expansion pack, but just by a whisker. <P> Developer Frog City has done some interesting things with the standard explore-and-conquer format, grounding it more firmly in history. It is still a turn-based strategy game with a tactical military element, but the particulars have changed a bit. When you start a new game, the known world is composed of the ""Old World."" This can be either a historical map of Europe or a random map. The Old World is made up of established neutral nations. To win, you must control one-half of this Old World. You can do that through military aggression or through economic and diplomatic means.  <P> The rest of the map is made up of the blacked-out, unknown ""New World,"" which you must explore and exploit. Forging alliances with native tribes and eventually taking over their land adds nothing to your total victory requirements, however. If you own the entire New World but still only have control over your original nation in the Old World, you won\'t win. The purpose of the New World is to add to your economic might: Exploitation of New World resources is essential to funding wars and expansion in the Old World. It\'s an interesting distinction grounded in historical reality. In the time period of the game (1500-1800), the New World\'s impact on the Old World was mostly one of supplying resources and influence. The true battleground was still Europe.  <P> Other changes to the system reflect the new strategies and economic realities of the period. Since this isn\'t an industrialized society, there\'s no need for mills and factories. Instead, goods are used for trade and sustaining your population. The population in turn is needed to process the goods. The most noticeable addition is the constant need to feed your population, which makes agriculture of central importance. Processing raw materials - the core of economic growth - takes a backseat to feeding the populace. This gets a bit tedious, even if it is historically accurate. <P> The most welcome addition is the ability to direct research. You can now choose which technology to develop next. Technologies improve the abilities of various units (ships move farther, military units are more powerful) or the yield of tile improvements, such as farms and mines. Internal development is still based on using special units to develop tiles to produce resources (food, minerals, etc), but these tiles must now be linked through a network of roads. Transportation allocation has been removed, so the goods now travel automatically. The military element has also undergone some subtle tweaking. Sieges are more common than skirmishes, and you can move units in any order now.. The latter remains an optional and not very interesting part of the game, but it\'s there for people who want more control over battles. <P> Imperialism was a good game with a cult following. You either liked it and stayed with it or found its low-key gameplay boring and quickly moved on. Its burnished bronze and sepia look wasn\'t necessarily what we expect from computer games, but the look was distinct and worked well in the context of the of the game. Imperialism II is a more refined and interesting use of the same system, with an excellent interplay of elements. Expansion is always checked by practical realities, and every alliance and war has a price. A well-balanced game with these elements is hard to create, and Frog City has done an excellent job of it with Imperialism II. <i>--Chet Thomas</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Panzer General 3D Assault,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>Panzer General 3D Assault</i> charts new territory for military strategy games by being the first of its kind to incorporate a three-dimensional environment without compromising the standards of depth and playability set by its predecessors. In this environment, forests burn during combat, cities and airfields can be destroyed, and units smoke and burn with damage. Additional features include a freely rotating camera and map, as well as a simplified and more intuitive interface. Besides making the leap into 3-D, <i>Panzer General 3D Assault</i> features a new combat system that truly puts the ""General"" in Panzer General. The system now emphasizes leader management instead of unit management. Players can promote, dismiss, or reassign their commanders in order to maximize their forces. As leaders gain experience and are promoted, they acquire more actions per turn and can perform more effectively. In addition to standard orders, leaders acquire and command up to 40 ""veteran"" orders, allowing them to launch all-out attacks, dive-bomb enemy positions, and attack with greater accuracy. Players can fight as the American, British, German, or French forces, choosing one of eight different campaigns on the Western Front during World War II, including North Africa. Ten areas of operation provide a variety of terrain and mission objectives. A new headquarters interface allows players to customize their armies to fit the upcoming battle. In addition to two-player combat via modem, <i>Panzer General 3D Assault</i> supports up to four players via LAN.', ""With its all-new 3D graphics engine and a handful of new features, Panzer General 3D Assault brings this popular turn-based tank-warfare series back for a third go-round. Though the 3D graphics can occasionally lead to command and control problems, the game is based on a good underlying system and offers the same brand of gameplay that made Panzer General such a huge hit. In short, it's more of the same, only better in most respects, which ought to be good news for fans of the series."", ""It won't take long to spot Panzer General 3D Assault's most prominent new feature: Instead of painted backgrounds and prerendered units, the game uses true 3D terrain maps and tiny little 3D-rendered unit graphics. As a result, this Panzer General looks very much like a tabletop miniatures game (but one played on a really cool tabletop that comes complete with rivers and little cities). The graphics are mostly good, and the rolling terrain is quite impressive. Unfortunately, the game suffers from the same problem as Panzer General II: Units in city hexes often get lost amidst the scenery. Also, aircraft float above their hexes but are often tough to pinpoint in areas cluttered with other units. Ordering aircraft to attack other aircraft can be confusing as well, as you must click on a destination hex square to move the planes, but then click on an airborne target that looks as if it's in a completely different spot."", ""However, once you get used to the 3D interface, most of these issues fade away. The only one that stays with you throughout is the lightning-fast combat resolution that occurs when units attack one another if you turn off the unit animation. As any Panzer General veteran knows, the combat animations are great for the first scenario or so, and then you shut them off to speed up gameplay. However, in Panzer General 3D Assault, it's difficult to tell what happened in a particular engagement unless you leave the animations on and watch the combat unfold. Otherwise, you pretty much have to go back and find the combatants on the map and highlight each to see who came out on top. Obviously, this is more of an issue when the AI takes its turn, since you can control the pace of your own attacks. You can click through moves to speed them up, but this can get repetitive. It's too bad there's no way to speed up the animations without actually skipping them."", ""Of course, there are some real benefits to the 3D engine. For starters, the maps and units are very well rendered, which gives the game an impressive and consistent look. Also, units that have sustained damage in combat will smoke and flame at varying levels to let you know their status. This is actually quite helpful when you're skimming the battlefield to see how things stand."", ""If you've played previous installments of this series, you probably won't have to change many habits in order to adapt to 3D Assault. Deep inside Panzer General 3D Assault's newfangled exterior lies a game very much like its predecessors, with the same basic wargaming system at play. Some of the extra features that had been added to Panzer General II are alive and well in this installment, including leaders with special abilities. Also, you can now make multiple moves and attacks with your units - the better a unit's leader is, the more actions it can take in a given turn. Some leaders let bombers operate even in bad weather, provide first-strike capabilities on every engagement, or let units avoid support fire from enemy artillery."", 'The game offers a new interface for managing all your leaders and the rest of your army between scenarios. Though the units look toy-like, and the process of assigning a leader to a unit could stand to gain a confirmation dialogue, this army-customization screen is fairly effective at simplifying the task of outfitting and upgrading your troops.', 'Panzer General 3D Assault includes eight campaigns that take place on the Western Front. Four of the campaigns are lengthy, full-fledged affairs, while the other four are much shorter minicampaigns. You can opt to command American, German, British, or French forces, and as in any Panzer General game, you can adjust all the various difficulty and game settings, such as the quality of reinforcements for both you and the AI.', 'The sound effects are pretty solid throughout, and each type of unit sounds appropriately different. Also, though they grow old in a hurry, some of the attack animations look pretty good. Dive-bombing attacks on ground units are particularly fun to watch. As with many SSI games, the musical score will probably strike a love-hate relationship with you; if you like the idea of stomping German forces to John Philip Sousa, then the music will suit you just fine.', 'Overall, Panzer General 3D Assault is a solid game built upon a proven game system. Despite its occasional problems, the 3D engine is a nice addition, and the gameplay is akin to Panzer General II with an even broader set of features, which should please most fans of the series. <i>--Michael E.

Vandal Hearts 2,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['PSX Role Playing series.  Hard to find sequel.', ""Although the RPG has gained popularity in the US, its tactical offshoot, the strategy-RPG, has had a harder time gaining similar popularity. However, among fans of the genre, no game has toppled Final Fantasy Tactics. As hard as Vandal Hearts II tries to emulate and even improve on FFT, VH2 falls short, but it still delivers an enjoyable strategy game. The first Vandal Hearts' story was digestible enough, but Vandal Hearts II unfortunately opts to fashion its story after Final Fantasy Tactics' incomprehensible saga. Joshua was but a poor peasant boy until he was manipulated into killing a revered political figure. Sure to be executed for this heinous act, Joshua fled his village and later founded a notorious band of mercenary thieves. These seemingly simple events set off a confusing political whirlwind of intrigue and betrayal that most people won't care to follow. For the most part, Vandal Hearts II's gameplay is standard strategy-RPG fare - you move your characters around a large world map and engage in turn-based battles on a variety of grid-based battlefields. However, unlike most games, this one doesn't follow a traditional turn-based model. As every game seems to feel the need to do these days, Vandal Hearts II employs an all-new system to differentiate itself from other games in the genre. The Dual Battle System lets the computer move characters and monsters during your turn, adding an interesting new strategic requirement. As interesting as the concept is, its execution is a little off - without any way of knowing in what order the enemy will attack, opponents will often move out of the way of your attacks. While you can work around this by wasting a move at the start of each turn to force the enemy to waste one of his turns, this really should be unnecessary. Vandal Hearts II's character-development system is limited when compared with that of the original, keeping things nicely framed and manageable. Unlike Final Fantasy Tactics' sprawling and unfocused job system, you can customize your characters with the game's wide assortment of weapons. Each weapon has one or more spells or abilities locked inside it. While initially inactive, a spell opens up after you've carried it in battle for several turns. Once a spell has been unlocked, it can be transferred to another weapon of the same type, making it beneficial to you to have characters that specialize in one type of weapon. While it is a little frustrating that you must stomp around the battlefield for a while to activate a weapon's abilities, you can enter any battlefield from the overworld map at any time to quickly enable whatever new spells your party may have before it fights any story-critical battles. Vandal Hearts II's visuals are just above average. The battlefield graphics are a few notches below Final Fantasy Tactics', but the battlefields themselves are much larger, making this an acceptable sacrifice. However, the squatty sprite-based characters that frolic on the maps are poorly animated and drawn. Worse still are the character portraits, all of which have awkward facial expressions and eight-bit-quality color depth. The orchestral soundtrack, however, is grandiose and epic, helping greatly to enhance the mood where the graphics don't. While Vandal Hearts II lacks the grand feel of Final Fantasy Tactics, it is a solid and rewarding strategy-RPG. It has flaws of its own, but it doesn't fall into the pitfalls that frustrated many of Final Fantasy Tactics' players, making it well suited for both veterans and newcomers to the genre.<i>--Peter Bartholow</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Flanker 2.0 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The 2.0 version of <i>Flanker</i> builds on the technical excellence of the original game by adding spectacular new 3-D graphics and sound effects. Choose a plane--the Su-33 Flanker or the Su-27 Flanker--and take off from a naval carrier or from your land base in this ultrarealistic flight simulator and combat game.', ""The original Su-27 Flanker was released in 1995 and was almost immediately recognized as having one of the most outstanding and realistic flight models to date. While the game was repackaged in 1997 with all the accumulated patches and a mission disc, Flanker fans have never seen an update to the graphics engine. The Flanker series always had the advantage of running well on lower-end machines, providing an uncompromising flight model without compromising your wallet. But with the arrival of Flanker 2.0, this circumspect approach to system requirements has been jettisoned in favor of more eye-catching graphics. Was it a fair trade? For the most part, yes. <P>Like its predecessors, Flanker 2.0 quite obviously models the Su-27 Flanker (and its naval variant, the Su-33). Just like previous versions, Flanker 2.0 is not a sim for the occasional flier. It is incredibly detailed and will seem daunting at first, even to reasonably experienced sim fans. For cautious players or those without previous Flanker experience, there is an excellent set of tutorial missions that covers every meaningful aspect of the aircraft in some way. Nevertheless, it will take you many hours to become proficient at this game. <P>The first thing veteran Flanker pilots will notice is that the controls are similar enough to the original Flanker, such that they can quickly get into the game. There is also a wonderful joystick configuration tool in the setup options that allows for very flexible joystick customization even if you don't have a programmable controller. The in-game cockpit lacks a 2D view, but the 3D view is easily readable and quite functional. The only problem is that while the HUD can be toggled to display in English, the cockpit instrumentation apparently cannot, despite the manual's assertion to the contrary. <P>Discussing the accuracy of flight models seems presumptuous coming from a reviewer whose real-world supersonic jet experience is limited to one ride on the Concorde. That said, Flanker 2.0 feels as tough and realistic as its predecessor. One way this realism comes across is that the plane feels quite sluggish to the novice, yet the twin engines pack a lot of punch and can move the plane remarkably nimbly if the pilot knows how. Weapons are also difficult to judge, but Flanker 2.0's weapons model is more realistic than most other sims - perhaps too realistic, because SAMs are incredibly hard to defeat, and their kill ratio seems unusually high. This adds to the difficulty level of the game and can be very frustrating. One reason might be that SAM-tracking radar can maintain a lock even through mountains, which is clearly a bug. <P>One of Flanker 2.0's most attractive features is that it lets you fly the naval variant, the Su-33, which means operating off an aircraft carrier. While carrier operations basically consist of takeoffs and landings, they can be challenging. As with all things in Flanker 2.0, practice improves performance, and in addition to the tutorial missions, the game includes an adequately comprehensive manual that will help you overcome such challenges. -- <i>Bruce Geryk</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Soldiers at War - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>Soldiers At War</i> is turn-based, squad-level combat with the heroism and drama of a good World War II movie. Players lead a squad of eight men through a hair-raising campaign of 18 linked scenarios. Experience D-Day and the assault on Monte Cassino. Execute commando raids and fight fierce house-to-house battles in bombed-out cities such as Anzio and Cherbourg. A flexible mission editor and 10 extra stand-alone missions, many from a German perspective, make the action virtually endless.', 'Random Games came very close to making a great game with last year\'s Wages of War. The engine, a detailed isometric view of a battlefield, showed great promise, with its Jagged Alliance meets X-COM style. A fairly clumsy interface, bugs, and a lethally slow pace conspired to ruin this promise, but the same core technology is now back and largely fixed in SSI\'s Soldiers at War. <P> Think ""X-COM in World War II"" and you have a general idea of what Soldiers at War offers. The perspective on the battlefield is a finely detailed god\'s-eye view of your grunts as they shoot, stab, and explode their way through a series of WWII missions ranging from Sicily to Normandy. All battles cover the European theater in small maps and can be played either in a campaign or single missions. The benefit of the campaign is that you can carry your already-equipped squad from mission to mission and rack up kills. Units gain rank and medals over campaigns, thereby earning more action points. <P> Each mission has specific goals, and action covers street fighting, building-to-building combat, assault, defense, and special ops. You may, for instance, have to find a map or rescue a trapped unit. Action begins with selection of a squad from a large roster of soldiers, each with varying skills. Some are better shots, while others are tougher, and so on. The unit selection screen is a weak link, since you need to bring up a dossier on each soldier to see its ratings, instead of being able to tell at a glance or scroll through them all. After a squad is formed, it is equipped with a wide array of weapons, including several types of guns, flamethrowers, grenades, knives, and explosives. Medikits, radios, minesweepers, and other tools are also available. <P> Units move and perform actions in turns, with enemy actions either shown (if they are in your line of sight) or obscured (if not). Units can kneel, crawl, walk, run, shoot, throw grenades, set explosives, reload their weapons, take over tanks, and generally do just about anything by expending combat points. The use of tanks is a bit off in the game: You can hop inside and fire the gun, but you can\'t drive them around. Plus, not all tanks can be used, which is disconcerting. <P> Interaction with your soldiers has its strong and weak points. A simple pop-up menu gives you access to all commands, but there is minimal keyboard support. I would much rather play this game without the mouse, but only facing and a few minor interface commands have hotkeys. More annoying is the separate status menu, which obscures almost half of the screen when open. It is unnecessarily bulky and doesn\'t even have the benefit of including most commands. While this sliding screen does eliminate the need for a framework interface, allowing the game to run full screen, it could have been made more useful. <P> As a value, Soldiers at War has some hits and misses. The campaign game is too short at 15 missions, and though some extra scenarios and multiplayer-specific maps are included, it just doesn\'t seem like enough. This is more than balanced by SSI\'s continued release of missions free on its web site, as well as by the custom mission editor. The editor enables the creation of custom maps and scenarios, and while the interface is a little clumsy and performance flaky (I experienced some palette shifts and crashes), it is a potent tool for extending game life. Four-player Internet multiplay also helps. A bug that prevented the Bulge mission from ending has been fixed in the current patch. <P> This isn\'t a realistic WWII tactical sim like Close Combat or Steel Panthers. It\'s more like a World War II movie, with plenty of dramatic sets and missions (think Aldo Raye in Battle Cry). The combat model will not appeal to tactical wargamers at all, since it is grossly simplified. This doesn\'t affect the fun factor, however, which is extremely high. Random Games is slowly realizing the flaws in its initial Wages of War design. A more streamlined interface and better keyboard support are still in order, as are faster pacing and larger maps. We can hope Random Games will include some of these refinements in the Warhammer game it\'s making with the same engine. (And ditch the tacky Clutch Cargo commander intros.) <P> If you\'re not looking for a time-intensive, stat-heavy WWII experience, then Soldiers at War is definitely worth a spin. It\'s attractive, entertaining, and challenging, and while it may lack the depth of Jagged Alliance, it is at least as satisfying as the tactical mode of X-COM. <i>--T.

There's really no secret to winning any of the races in the game - all you have to do is pick your line and try to get around the corners as tightly as possible. When coming off any of the big jumps in the game, it's actually quite fun to pull off tricks in the air, although if you're like me you'll have to keep in mind that races aren't won on style. After you catch some air, a little distance indicator will come up and discretely let you know just how far and high the jump was.

It doesn't suffer from too much pop-up, and the 3D models of the riders and bikes look good, as do the spectators, tents, cars, hay bales, and other ambient objects on the sides of the tracks. The animations of the rider performing tricks, leaning, sticking his leg out in a turn, and other various movements look fairly realistic. The game has a good frame rate and moves at a brisk pace - it really gives you a good false sense of speed.

Age of Empires,,[],"['Video Games', 'Mac', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>Age of Empires</i> is an epic, real-time strategy game spanning 10,000 years. Starting with minimal resources, players guide the evolution of small Stone Age tribes into great civilizations. Gamers can choose one of several ways to win the game, including world domination by conquering enemy civilizations, exploration of the known world, and economic victory through the accumulation of wealth.', 'Age of Empires was a highly anticipated game for the Mac because when it was released for the PC, it was widely viewed as a milestone in real-time strategy. Age of Empires is a unique hybrid of empire-building strategy games like Civilization II and real-time action strategy games like WarCraft, and it delivers a unique gaming experience.', ""On the surface, Age of Empires delivers the empire-building goods, encouraging you to advance your civilization from the Stone Age through to the Iron Age. However, this is about the only likeness to Civ II-style empire-building in the game. Unlike Civilization, in which your empire advances thanks to research and improvements, in Age of Empires your nation advances because you hoard resources and pay your way into first the Tool Age, then the Bronze Age, and finally the Iron Age. The result is that the notion of empire building is mainly a formality. With each advancement you can obtain improved buildings, naval ships, and units, but that doesn't necessarily change your strategy."", ""Strategy is, in fact, reduced to naval supremacy. Whichever player gets the most powerful navy first will generally win the game. Naval units are able to bombard buildings and land units and have a tremendously unfair advantage. Poor unit AI also has a big impact on Age of Empires's playability. Computer-controlled units are smart, very smart - even SkyNet and Terminator smart - while your units are dumb as bricks, unable to get from point A to point B without help."", ""All things considered, there is still a lot to like in Age of Empires. Despite the flaws in the empire-building aspects, the game adds a new twist to real-time strategy gaming, and that is enough to outweigh, or at least compensate for, many of the game's problems. If you're tired of the Command &amp; Conquer clone, this game definitely offers something different. Age of Empires still uses the tried-and-true resource-gathering model of C&amp;C and WarCraft, but instead of one or two resources, you now have four to contend with, which adds more complexity to the game."", 'There is also a huge variety of units to play with. Military units come in Infantry, Archer, Cavalry, and Siege varieties, each one possessing characteristics that advance as you advance from the Stone Age. The Infantry is the workhorse of the military, starting out as a simple man with a club and evolving to a heavily armored, tough Centurion. One of the most enjoyable parts of Age of Empires is advancing the military units.', 'Overall, the single-player game has quite a bit of depth to it. There are easily 40 to 50 hours worth of missions to complete. The missions can get a bit redundant, and some of the mission objectives are very difficult, but a mission editor greatly enhances long-term playability. Multiplayer games are limited to playing against other Mac users only.', ""Age of Empires is a compelling game, largely because it diverges in so many ways from traditional real-time strategy titles. But because Age of Empires treads new paths, it makes a few mistakes along the way, some of which can be forgiven and some of which are frustrating. Flaws aside, you'll have a good time playing. - Rick Sanchez"", '<b>Good News:</b> Unique, deep gameplay. Large variety of units. Lots of missions for long playability. Mission editor.', '<b>Bad News:</b> Poor unit AI. Naval units are too strong and unbalance gameplay.', '1999 MacAddict -- <i><a href=""https://secure.imaginemedia.com/group/maca/8VPX.html"">From MacAddict -- Subscribe now!</a></i><br /><br />When you first play Age of Empires, a warm feeling develops in your gut. Warcraft meets Civilization! Real-time empire-building! And does it ever look sharp and feel right.', ""But an uneasy feeling builds as you get deeper into it, a sense that all is not quite right. This is not quite the game you hoped for. Even worse, it has some definite problems. The pitfall when you review a game as anticipated and debated as this one is to make sure you criticize it for what it is, not for what you wish it was. I wish that Age of Empires was what it claimed to be - Civilization with a Warcraft twist. Instead, it is Warcraft with a hint of Civilization. That's all well and good, but it places it firmly in the action-oriented real-time combat camp, rather than in the high-minded empire-building of Civilization. The result is Warcraft in togas, with slightly more depth but a familiar feel."", 'Age of Empires places you on a map in an unexplored world, provides a few starting units, and lets you begin building an empire. Each game unfolds the same way. You begin with a town center and some villagers. The villagers are the basic laborers, and the town center enables you to build more of them and expand your settlement. The villagers are central to AOE: they gather resources, build structures, and repair units and buildings. Resources come in four forms: wood, food, stone, and gold. A certain amount of each is consumed to build various units and buildings, research new technology, and advance a civ to the next age.', 'There is no complex resource management or intricate economic model at work here. What you have is the same old real-time resource-gathering in period garb, with four resources instead of one or two. As your civ advances, you develop greater needs for these resources, but the way in which they are gathered and used becomes only marginally more complex (certain research can cause faster harvesting or more production). It appears on the surface to be a complex evocation of the way early civs gathered and used materials, but beneath the hood is the same old ""mine tiberium, buy more stuff than the other guys"" model. It is the first hint that AOE is a simple combat game rather than a glorious empire-builder.', ""There's no denying the thrill the first time a villager chucks a spear at an antelope and spends several minutes hacking meat from its flank with a stone tool. This is the level of detail that brings an empire-building game to life. If only those villagers would grow and develop over the course of the game, it would make it so much more interesting. If only they would trade in their loincloths for some britches and maybe some orange camouflage, and switch from spears to arrows and rifles. Yes, that's another game, but it could easily have been done in AOE, and why it wasn't is a mystery."", ""The problem is that while enemy AI is savvy and aggressive (it can afford to be since it appears to cheat with resources), your units are bone-stupid. Path-finding is appallingly botched, with units easily getting lost or stuck. There is a waypoint system, but that hardly makes up for the fact that your units have trouble moving from point A to point B if you don't utilize it. Military units will stand idly by while someone a millimeter away is hacked to pieces. They respond not at all to enemy incursion in a village and wander aimlessly in the midst of battle. Was this deliberate so that the gamer needed to spend more time in unit management? If so, it was a poor idea, since there is simply too much going on midgame to worry about whether your military is allowing itself to be butchered in one corner of the map while you are aggressively tending to a battle in another portion."", ""AOE obviously is sticking close to an early-empire motif, and there's nothing at all wrong with that. Stone, Tool, Bronze, and Iron are the four ages, and with each come new structures and military units. You don't earn these advanced ages - you buy them with resources. Advancement is a simple matter of hoarding and spending food and gold. The overall welfare of your state is irrelevant as long as it survives: happiness is not measured, trade is barely modeled, and the state exists merely to produce a military machine to crush everyone else on the map. Naval power has a woefully unbalancing effect upon gameplay, with a strong navy able to shred the competition at the expense of reality."", 'Micromanagement is the name of the game in AOE. There is no unit queue, and to build five villagers, you need to build one, wait, build another, and so on. With units acting so stupidly, you should be able to set their level of aggression and the manner in which they attack (a la Dark Reign), but that is also not an option. Diplomacy is relegated to tribute and nothing more, and alliances are hard to form. You can be allied, neutral, or at war with other civs, but if the radio button is still set to ""allied"" when an opponent starts firing on your units, your units will not fire back, defend themselves, or even flee. They will just be destroyed. Cues as to exactly what\'s happening on the map are obscure; the duty has been relegated to unrelated sound effects. Does that bugle call mean my building is finished being built, or my units are under attack? How about some help, people? Victory conditions can also be irritating. There are several campaigns that require that specific goals be met, and these quickly grow tiresome. Thankfully, there is an excellent custom generator that lets you set map size, starting tech, resources, and other features. This is the saving grace of AOE, and what kept me coming back again and again. The main reason is that it let me change some of the insane default victory requirements, such as when the victor is the first to build a ""wonder"" (through another massive consumption of resources) that stands for 2000 years. These 2000 years can pass in about twenty minutes of game time. That means that as soon as an opponent builds a wonder, you create a whacking huge navy to go over and blow it up. Not a very subtle way to maintain an empire. In fact, there is no strategic nuance: It is merely a brawny muscle contest.', ""If all these judgments seem harsh, it is only because Age of Empires looked, and pretends, to be so very much more. It still has tons of potential and a fundamental gameplay that remains entertaining enough to overcome the flaws and merit a fair rating. The system can go very far with some fine-tuning, but as it stands it seems downright schizo. Is it a simplified Civilization or a modestly beefed up Warcraft? It's almost as if the designers started out to create one game and ended up with another. With such beautiful production and the fundamentals of a vastly entertaining game, it's sad that it fell short of the mark. The disappointment is not merely with what AOE is, but with what it failed to be. <i>--T. Liam McDonald</i> <br /><i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

If you were a fan of X Games Pro Boarder, then you\'ll definitely like MTV Sports: Snowboarding since it\'s really the ""unofficial"" sequel.', ""What made X Games Pro Boarder such a great game is also what makes this game great - the easy and intuitive control, along with incredibly spacious courses that really let you explore the mountain. The typical boundaries that restrict you to a narrow run, found in other snowboarding games, are all but absent on most courses. And even when you do come across them you can usually simply jump over them. The game has six boarders to choose from, each with his own style, strengths, and weaknesses. The boarders aren't terribly different from one another, but if you have one area that you prefer (speed, maneuverability, and so on), the differences do help. You can also choose from a variety of boards from real manufactures like K2, Libtech, and Forum."", ""The game features five game modes - qualifying, challenge, create-a-park, head-to-head, and training - to get you used to the controls. The qualifying mode is where you start out and where you must rack up enough points on three levels to enter the challenge mode. Once you have enough points, you can compete against other boarders and enter the challenge mode, where you race for time against other boarders, as well as perform for points in trick events. Whoever has the best combined times and/or higher trick points moves on. The create-a-park feature lets you create your own course. This feature offers limited options, but it's still kind of cool to set up a monster-jump course to try out. The head-to-head mode pits you against a human opponent in a point contest or a timed race."", ""At the game's outset, there are four regions to choose from: the US, Japan, Norway, and New Zealand. Each region is broken up into various events: mountain X, big air contest, half-pipe, and slopestyle. Completing the challenge mode will open up more hidden levels and events."", ""The responsiveness and overall control setup of the game are elegantly simple and easy for beginners to get used to. Once you get used to the basic controls, you can attempt more-advanced trick combinations and maneuvers just as you would in real-life snowboarding. There are tons of different combinations of tricks, grabs, and aerial maneuvers that you'll learn to perform with time and practice."", 'Visually, MTV Sports: Snowboarding is pretty good. Each boarder has a distinct look. The boarders move and sway as they cut down the mountain and perform all their tricks realistically. Ad banners, camera towers, trees, advisory signs, patches of earth, as well as jumps, half-pipe areas, and rails can be seen and used on the courses. The backgrounds and mountains far off in the distance look extremely good as well.', 'The soundtrack for MTV Sports: Snowboarding features real music like Blink 182\'s ""Don\'t Leave Me Alone"" and ""Wendy Clear,"" Face to Face\'s ""Disconnected,"" Fear Factory\'s remake of ""Cars,"" and Ministry\'s ""Jesus Built My Hotrod,"" to name a few. Needless to say, this collection of music makes for one of the best soundtracks for a PlayStation game ever. The sound effects for falling, riding over rocks, and cutting hard on the snow are also pretty good.', ""In the end, the free-roaming unrestricted feeling you get when you play MTV Sports: Snowboarding, combined with the great control setup, make it so much fun - and, ultimately, more of a snowboarding game than any other title out there.

A cooperative mode allows two players to tackle the  job together, and up to four players can compete in death match-style squishes... er, skirmishes. <i>--Eric  Twelker</i>', 'Acclaim Studios London must have noticed that MicroProse had neglected to properly exploit its license for last year\'s giant bug-filled sci-fi film Starship Troopers for the console systems, because the inspiration behind its latest game for the Nintendo 64 is crystal clear. Though the name of the game comes from a little-known Acclaim Comics property where a military unit possesses futuristic suits of armor along the lines of Marvel Comics\' Iron Man, the alien race that the group clashes with in Armorines is totally dissimilar to the one found in the comic book. However, the alien race bears more than a passing resemblance to the swarm of creatures found in Paul Verhoeven\'s recent cinematic ode to fascism.  Enough back story. Armorines is a first-person shooter in which you have two characters to choose from, one who is slow but powerful and another who moves and fires more quickly but isn\'t quite as sturdy. This choice of characters is the game\'s main innovation over Acclaim\'s Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, the game whose engine powers Armorines, which comes up very short in comparison. In fact, Armorines is, in many ways, all the things you didn\'t like about Turok 2 and little of what you did like.  The inventive weapons, well-designed monsters, and challenging enemy AI found in Turok 2 are all missing here, and the only scripted events you\'ll come across are an onrush of monsters after you\'ve opened a door or have acquired an item. Remember the big levels in Turok 2, where you had to backtrack for half an hour just to find a key or kidnapped child? Do you recall how your enemies disappeared after they died so you didn\'t have a clear indication if you\'d been in that area before? Both of those elements are well represented in Armorines, with a dash of unclear explanation of mission objectives tossed in for good measure. For example, in one of the jungle missions, you\'re charged with destroying 34 alien eggs before they hatch. Expect to run around the level for quite awhile, looking for the last batch of eggs, all the while wondering how many you have remaining because the only indication of your progress is an open checkbox on your mission list (indicating you haven\'t found them all and, likewise, completed the mission). ""What do I do now?"" and ""Which way am I supposed to go?"" are questions that come up far too often in this game. Armorines supports the Expansion Pak, which bumps up its graphics to high resolution without affecting the frame rate aversely. Unfortunately, the environments are very sparse and bland and appear much more like those found in the original Turok game than in its more impressive sequel. And while fog is not always present, draw-in appears quite often. Besides the in-game visuals, the game\'s presentation and interface are extremely lackluster and add to the impression that the title was rushed out the door for a holiday release. The audio side of Armorines is simply lousy. The soundtrack is made up of extremely short, rhythmic loops, while effects like walking on stone are represented with a sound like someone dribbling a basketball, and enemy death knells sound like a horse screaming in pain.  The multiplayer modes in Armorines aren\'t all bad, but they\'re not that great, either. A few basic alterations on the standard deathmatch are provided, and a decent frame rate is maintained. But the levels are very boring. It\'s hard to draw a bead on your foes, and all the little extras seen in other N64 games with multiplayer modes over the last few years fail to appear. However, a two-player cooperative version of the main game is offered, which does end up adding a lot of value to the title. One strong point isn\'t enough to save Armorines, though, with everything else just conspiring to make it feel like a bad Turok 2: Seeds of Evil clone. And since the developers couldn\'t put a ton of huge monstrous bugs onscreen at once because they\'d bog down the frame rate, Armorines is prevented from being the Starship Troopers bug hunt it so desperately wanted to be.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Madden NFL 2000,,"['All 31 NFL teams', 'Variety of gameplay modes', 'More than 150 offensive and defensive plays', 'Substitutions, reverse plays, and diving catches']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Game Boy Color', 'Games', '</span></span></span>', 'All 31 NFL teams', 'Variety of gameplay modes', 'More than 150 offensive and defensive plays', 'Substitutions, reverse plays, and diving catches']",{},"[""The players may look pint-sized, but you'll still find all the hard-hitting action of the NFL in MADDEN NFL 2000. Choose from all 31 of the NFL teams and hit the field for an Exhibition Match-up or a Sudden Death game, where the team that scores first wins. If you are looking for a challenge, fight your way through the Season to make the Playoffs and maybe even the Super Bowl. Or you can just skip the Season and head straight to the Playoffs. All of the elements of pro football are here: substitutions, reverse plays, audibles, diving catches, and so much more. With over 150 different offensive and defensive plays, the playing style of each team can be recreated. Put on a helmet and get ready for some football with MADDEN NFL 2000."", ""Madden 2000 is the latest in the long and seemingly never-ending list of sports games that EA churns out for every platform in existence (well, except the Dreamcast). In its latest effort for the Game Boy Color, the wizards at THQ and Tiertex have managed to squeeze almost all the cool features into the Game Boy. It's quite a feat, really. As you can on the home systems, you can choose from any of the current NFL teams and set up your own seasons, playoffs, exhibition games, and even sudden-death matches, where the first team to score wins. The depth and attention to detail that have been present in many of the previous Madden titles are here as well: You can call audibles, substitute players, fake field goals, reverse plays, and make onside kicks. Controlling the players is a snap: The two buttons handle everything from choosing receivers to making diving catches, and it's all done intuitively. You can also adjust game time and weather - a sudden-death match in the cold winter snow is good for a laugh. The Madden AI is no slouch either. Although I made almost all of my passing plays on the first try, the CPU will punish you if you fall asleep on the bench, and the computer mixes up its plays quite well (though the Buffalo Bills seemed to always choke on third down). The graphics are clear and crisp, and the game briefly pauses whenever the ball is thrown so that you can easily find the ball on the screen and respond accordingly. Players who score touchdowns even do a brief celebratory dance. Fans of portable gaming who generally dislike sports titles should give Madden 2000 a try: The control is dead-on, the graphics are clean, and there are enough options to keep you tossing the pigskin around for a long time.<i>--Doug Trueman</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six  - Mac,,[],"['Video Games', 'Mac', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Action rules the day as you lead an elite, multinational strike force and engage enemies in exotic locales, such as a decaying mansion in the Congo, a Paris theme park, and a North Sea drilling platform.', ""The race to topple Electronic Arts' SEAL Team from the top of the special forces genre has heated up tremendously. First was Zombie Interactive's Spec Ops, released earlier this year. Both Novalogic and Interactive Magic have their own games coming out later this year. Now, Red Storm Entertainment weighs in with its own game, buoyed by the marketable name of Tom Clancy and his story-telling capability. Players take control of the international Rainbow team of super-secret operatives, doing the dirty work other modern nations wouldn't publicly touch. While generally better than Spec Ops, Rainbow Six carries its own baggage, especially where the conflict of realism versus gameplay rears its ugly head."", 'Rainbow Six offers several modes of play, including a large variety of training missions (different shooting ranges, obstacle courses, single-team hostage rescue, multiteam hostage rescue, and so on), the main campaign, and various multiplayer scenarios (like cooperative mission, deathmatch, and team deathmatch). The campaign can be played in one of three difficulty levels, with more objectives and less team casualty tolerance as the difficulty level increases. The campaigns resemble a tree trunk rather than a branching tree, so to get to the next mission, you must successfully complete the previous one.', 'Rainbow Six contains two main parts: mission planning and mission execution. For the first four missions in the campaign, Red Storm has provided a prescripted mission plan, but the next 12, you must do all the work. First comes the mission storyline and notes from various characters, of which most is not required reading to finish the mission. After picking which agents to use on the mission, what team they\'ll be on, and what equipment they\'ll use, it\'s time to hit the mission planning interface. The player is supplied with a complete floor plan of the area in question, possible and known locations of terrorists, where the mission objectives are, and so on. The player lays out where the teams will go, which ""go"" codes to use, the rules of engagement, and speed options. While a 3D rendering of the map is available, the only downside is that you can no longer see the movement paths of your teams; they\'re covered up.', ""After making sure you've got the mission planned (and make sure it's been saved), it's time to play out the mission. The interface is fairly similar to any number of modern first-person games like Quake II and Unreal, and graphically, the game is on par or slightly better than Spec Ops. The game models human motions and movement extremely well, including many different unique actions. Rainbow Six's audio cues, background sounds, and other various noises are also represented very well; the immersive feeling of Rainbow Six is perhaps one of the best seen in a game. The only downside is that, for some, the mouse interface can be a bit sensitive for those that are not used to it and can only be tuned from Windows."", ""A mission plays out as you take control of one of the teams, the others follow scripted layouts already devised in the mission planner. You can switch between the teams easily, but not team members. Teams follow waypoints, engaging enemies that come within range with ruthless efficiency (or mindless stupidity, as you'll learn) or waiting for a go code to move on to the next waypoint. With some decent planning and a bit (or lots) of human guidance, you can complete the missions and the game."", ""Well, it seems a bit simple, but in reality, Rainbow Six is pretty hard. The game skirts the magical barrier between realism and gameplay, hedging a bit on realism on some features and going straight overboard on the gameplay front. While combat is fast and furious, with one or two bullets almost guaranteeing a kill, the AI is schizophrenic at best and can kill your members at a moment's notice without them having the slightest clue as to how they can react to an adverse situation."", ""For example, suppose you had a team of four members moving down a corridor with rooms on either side. Let's say the team is moving to the other end of the corridor, and a terrorist is in one of the side rooms. As each member goes by the room, the terrorist guns him down. He doesn't react to the fire except by rushing toward the next waypoint like an eager lemming. Terrorists seem to react the same way; one particular encounter saw a terrorist calmly smoking a cigarette standing around the bodies of two dead buddies. Grenades seem to have an explosion range of about two feet."", ""Obviously, lots can go wrong in a mission. You will spend lots of time refining your mission layout, which really gives the impression that the missions are puzzle-oriented, which, in a way, they are. Typically, you'll be doing lots of the work (killing) personally, since the AI handles tight room environments very badly. Expect to replay missions 20, 30, or 40 times to complete them without high casualty counts. At times, it can get very annoying and frustrating. Then again, if you treat the entire game as things would happen in real life, Rainbow Six would be insanely difficult - with all its faults, it's fairly hard enough already."", 'Multiplayer saves the game though and allows basically unlimited replay of the missions with multiple teams (making coordination and reaction times much better, despite the typical lag), and deathmatches are sweaty do-or-die affairs where one good bullet to the head puts you out for the rest of the game. Replayability is also helped by the fact that there are a lot of different ways to complete a mission, and they get much harder as the difficulty level goes up.', ""So, just what is Rainbow Six? It's actually a pretty good game, albeit very hard and extremely frustrating. Some of the gameplay mechanics simply go straight against common sense, but some concessions had to be made to accommodate computer gameplay. Other elements are very realistic, and some of the gameplay elements are right on the money. Players who thought Spec Ops had lots of potential but didn't execute well should check out Rainbow Six because, despite the faults, the game does work better and does have that immersive, realistic feel. Players can even experiment with the game mechanics by looking at some of the definition files in the Rainbow Six directory. Rainbow Six is a pretty good game that over time - and perhaps with official and unofficial support - may become a great game. -- <i> Alan Dunkin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Bass Master 2000 N64,,['Nintendo 64'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"[""For those who enjoy the lure of fishing but can't stand the early hours, <I>Bassmasters 2000</I> offers the realism, detailed graphics, and inevitable fun one expects from a fishing simulation game endorsed by B.A.S.S. (Bass Anglers Sportsman Society)."", '<I>Bassmasters 2000</I> takes virtual anglers to highly detailed re-creations of the same lakes that are on the Bassmaster tournament circuit. Presented in a television-style format, the game features angling legends Shaw Grigsby and Roland Martin providing up-to-the-moment commentary and expert advice. Off the lake, players can visit a virtual tackle shop to upgrade bait and equipment, and the create-an-angler mode lets players choose a distinct personality. A split-screen, two-player mode offers a witness to confirm or deny that inevitable tale about the big one that got away. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>', 'Feel the need to get out on the lake and do some fishing, but you just can\'t break away from the daily grind long enough to make the trip? Perhaps you need to reorganize your priorities, my friend. But until that day, you can always use THQ\'s latest fishing game, Bassmasters 2000, to tide you over. The game has a lot of impressive features, such as real lakes, color commentary, and even a create-an-angler mode. You can choose from several different modes of play including a speed-fishing mode that lets you jump right into the action, a casting game that helps improve your casting accuracy, a two-player split-screen mode, and a tournament mode. One of the best things about Bassmasters 2000 is its wonderfully designed control scheme, which really makes you feel as though you have a fishing rod in your hands. The analog stick controls your rod very precisely. In addition, the game has reel speeds, and it also lets you change the amount of drag you have set. All of these things are taken into account when you hook a fish, so knowing the basics of fishing is essential. If you\'ve got your drag set too high, or you try to reel the fish in too fast when it\'s fighting, or you\'re not fast enough when it\'s not fighting, the line could break, or the fish could simply slip off the hook. Whatever the outcome, playing the game is a whole lot of fun thanks to the responsive controls and true-to-life setup, which makes playing more about what you do and how you do it than about sheer luck. As in any business, catching big bass is all about location. Bassmasters 2000 does a wonderful job of representing this fact by putting the fish right where they\'d be in real life, based on the weather conditions and time of day. Your cherry bass boat, outfitted with a depth finder, makes finding good fishing spots a fun little activity. Visually, all of the different types of fish and lakes look accurate, as do your angler, boat, and gear. The camera angle that shows the underwater action, letting you scan for nearby bass, is pretty good. Being able to see a fish as it\'s about to strike your lure is actually pretty exciting - you\'ll wish you could have such a view in real life. The game features several sizes of fish, so you know which ones are worth your time. Even the sound and music in Bassmasters 2000 are rather good, although the color commentary provided by Shaw Grisby becomes a little unnerving after awhile. He mostly just belts out stupid one liners that are either insulting or overly happy, like ""You can\'t catch any fish without getting your bait wet,"" or the constant ""Nice cast!"" In any case, the game\'s audio does get the job done, with lots of decent sound effects and a couple of backwoods-style music tracks. In the end, Bassmasters 2000 is a great game with wonderful controls, true-to-life fish behavior, and great graphics and sound. This game will definitely please any angler, whether a real-life bass-fishing expert or a beginner looking for some practice.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<i>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</i> tells the story of Raziel, one of the undead lieutenants of the vampire lord Kain. Jealous of Raziel's newly evolved wings, Kain tears them apart and casts his former champion into the netherworld. But something--some kind of powerful entity that dwells in the netherworld--has restored Raziel to a semblance of life and has set him on a path of vengeance."", ""After this tantalizing movie introduction, you take control of Raziel in the spectral realm, where your new existence is explained to you. From there you enter the physical plane, ready to begin your quest for power and revenge. Raziel's combat moves are extremely brutal, as you'd expect from a vampire who has returned from the dead. When he finds a spear, Raziel gleefully stabs and slashes before he impales his foe, lifts it off the ground, and feasts on its soul. Doing so enhances Raziel's power, and devouring the souls of the rest of Kain's lieutenants is the only way to get the special abilities--scaling walls, phasing through gates, etc.--needed to reach Kain himself. While fun for adults, parents should take note: this game is definitely <i>not</i> suitable for kids."", ""Not everyone enjoyed Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, a top-down action-adventure in the vein of Nintendo's classic Legend of Zelda. But many were compelled to play it through because of its remarkable story, told by its eloquent vampire protagonist. And Kain's vengeful narrative is the solitary precedent for Soul Reaver, Blood Omen's sequel, which is a 3D action game focussing on his firstborn son. As a sequel to a story, Soul Reaver expands upon Blood Omen by shifting the perspective and complicating, rather than recycling, the preexisting themes. And as a sequel to a game, Soul Reaver boldy abandons all but its most essential ties to its predecessor, even as it conspicuously resolves the original's technical problems. But while Soul Reaver starts strong, both as a testament to storytelling and technical achievement in its genre, its gameplay gradually wears thin and ultimately falls short of the game's high ambitions. <P> Kain's world of Nosgoth is teetering on the brink of destruction by the time his son Raziel rises from an ancient grave in a watery abyss. However, Nosgoth is an entirely beautiful place even in its death throes. Gentle rainfall, bleak skies, and decrepit architecture subdue what would otherwise be a majestic countryside, one so vividly realized that it often looks real. Interior architecture is similarly detailed but even more unbelievable in scope and scale. Gigantic vents and furnaces, subterrannean lakes and catacombs, and other mysterious natural, unnatural, and supernatural vistas abound and make Raziel's travels constantly impressive to behold. <P> Raziel's ability to shift from the material plane to the spectral plane at will is especially remarkable; this transition bizarrely and beautifully affects his environment, which bends and twists as its colors warp. Other special effects, including Raziel's ghostly blade from which the game takes its title, are equally stunning. However, if you can tear your eyes away from the scenery, you'll notice that some of Razi
