In the game you are responsible for the line-up, the tactics and training of your team, for signing the right players and the extension of your club facilities and the stadium. The special highlights in FM12 are the FIFA license, the FIFA 3D engine, more than 41,000 licensed players, 13,000 of whom come with original player pictures, the player manager and national team manager mode, the Create-a-Club mode and the Match Prognosis Tool as well as a unique, comprehensive editor.', '<b>Features:</b>', '<b>3D match</b></br> A special highlight this year is the 3D game option of FIFA MANAGER 12. This area of the game representation is a matter close to the heart for a lot of fans of the franchise, so that this year a whole team consisting of designers, graphic artists and programmers have put the entire logic of the 3D mode to the test and completely reprogrammed large sections of it.', 'A new player AI, for instance, and marked improvements in terms of the substitutions, tactics and the conduct of opposing managers, e.g. after players are sent off, results from this. The new intuitive user interface makes it possible for you to retrieve all the data relevant to the game within seconds and to issue precise tactical instructions.', '<b>New club facilities</b></br> 25 buildings with a total of 289 configuration levels are reproduced in detail. In addition there are up to three stadia with up to 120,000 seats directly on the club grounds.', 'Buildings age and have to be renovated. Each configuration level has specific impacts in other areas of the game. As a player you are thus constantly faced by decisions to make and must develop a genuine strategy in terms of how you want to set up your club in the future.', '<b>Finances</b></br> The financial sector in FIFA MANAGER 12 is also entirely new. Cubs and players have to first gain the trust of the financial markets through sporting successes. Realistic revenue of the main sponsors help to exactly reflect the large financial differences between top clubs and a smaller club in the game.', 'A stock exchange with club shares should, of course, not be absent. In the sponsorship sector there are also numerous improvements, such as the sponsors&lsquo; pyramid or sponsors&rsquo; campaigns to obtain new partners. Moreover, there is the option in FIFA MANAGER 12 of much more intensive interchanges with the main sponsor, who wants to be kept happy.', ""<b>Transfer market</b></br> In the transfer section you can now field players in trials in test matches or commission a detailed analysis of the squad so the team's weak points can be specifically eliminated. Due to the fact that all the AI managers make use of these squad analysis options, the transfers will once again become even more realistic. In this way AI clubs can also cash in expensive stars who do not want to extend their contracts just before their contracts expire."", '<b>Classic areas in a new look</b></br> A whole range of new options will be available to you in the calendar. From the charity event to direct friendly match queries and extending to lactate tests, no wishes are left unfulfilled.', 'In <i>FIFA MANAGER 12</i> the training can once again be planned and implemented on a daily basis in individual units. The player development was made more realistic here which makes the games even more challenging especially at the higher difficulty levels. A special fitness coach will now also offer you his services from the start of the season.', 'In the Weekly Progress sequence that can now be configured you can select your favourite statistics in a targeted manner and, for instance, precisely track the training or the building progress on the club facilities.', 'The instant calculation, the cooperation with your Board, the player talks, interviews and the Personal Life feature were also extended.', '<b>Your feature!</b></br> The fans have been able to directly influence the content of the new FIFA MANAGER game for the first time due to the ""Your Feature!"" campaign. In seven ballots several thousand participants have, for instance, opted for features such as ""Pre-match Speeches"", ""Hosting a European cup final match"", a ""Trial training day for hobby players"", and the revamping of the ""Final 24 hours of the transfer market"".', 'The ""Manager Tasks&rdquo; have also become particularly exciting. Here you as a manager are constantly presented with new tasks in addition to your day to day business so you can gain additional points and achieve manager levels. You can then use these for instance for more effective team talks.', '<b>Online mode</b></br> The online mode that was successfully launched two years ago should also, of course, not be absent in FM12. All the premium features from the previous year were made freely accessible for all players. The players can now exchange various action items in return for their manager points, there is an extensive avatar editor and the option of creating fantasy leagues.

The 6.1mm of height added by CQC creates a nearly seamless feel for those looking for big results but prefer less adjustment time. CQC is also perfect for younger gamers or those with hands on the smaller side. CQC helps increase all-around accuracy, too, so it will surely help you get the most out of short-to-mid range munitions like shotguns and subs.""]","by

Its inhabitants believed their world a paradise. Under the Sanctum's rule, Cocoon had long known peace and prosperity. Mankind was blessed by its protectors, the benevolent fal'Cie, and believed that tranquil days would continue forever. Their tranquillity was shattered with the discovery of one hostile fal'Cie. The moment that fal'Cie from Pulse - the feared and detested lowerworld - awoke from its slumber, peace on Cocoon came to an end. Fal'Cie curse humans, turning them into magic-wielding servants. They become l'Cie - chosen of the fal'Cie. Those branded with the mark of a l'Cie carry the burden of either fulfilling their Focus or facing a fate harsher than death itself. A prayer for redemption. A wish to protect the world. A promise to challenge destiny. After thirteen days of fates intertwined, the battle begins.

At its core is a virtual wind tunnel that creates the most realistic flight modeling available on a desktop. Equally capable of simulating every type of aircraft, the virtual pilot is able to experience the challenges of flying big airliners or tiny ultra-light aircraft. The realism of X-Plane 10 is proven by the fact that X-Plane is used as a certified training tool. Created from many real world databases you will see almost all roads and built-up areas exactly as they are around you. The completely new rendering engine shows the world around you in high detail and with global illumination so lights behave like real lights. Air Traffic Control will guide you from startup to shutdown and also controls the other aircraft around you. Those other aircraft are not robotic as they are in other simulators, but they interact with the world in the same way as your own aircraft does. They will fight the same cross winds and turbulence as you encounter, they will need more runway to stop when the weather conditions are not favorable. Just like real pilots do, you will watch their take-off to be prepared for what your take-off will be like. It's still simulated but it gets very close to real aviation! X-Plane 10 is built with the future in mind and makes full use of the hardware in your system. If you own a fast multi-core machine you will be able to simulate more aircraft around you and see more details but even with a moderate machine X-Plane 10 is capable of displaying a tremendous amount of objects without slowing down. <BR><BR> Auto-generated scenery that includes almost every road New rendering engine with innovative global lighting system (first for flight simulation) Totally flexible and extendable with thousands of existing add-ons (and many more to come)Minimum System requirements - Windows XP / Vista / 7, LINUX""]","by

The entire experience is crafted to accommodate the widest variety of play styles-from the lone mercenary with only moments a day to spare, to the legion of comrades campaigning for days on end, and every combination in between.<br /><br /> Join players from around the world in an adventure of infinite possibilities."", ""<strong>Story</strong><br /> The guardian gods and goddesses known as the Twelve watch over the city-states of Eorzea. These tiny nations carved out a history of blood and betrayal, forging and breaking alliances as each warred over territory and sought to impose uncompromising interpretations of their patron deities' will.<br /><br /> The fate of the land would, however, soon change. Not fifteen years past, a new threat appeared from the north and east-the mighty Garlean Empire. With its fleets of behemoth airships and warriors brandishing weapons that spewed streams of fire, it crushed Ala Mhigo, the most powerful of the six Eorzean city-states. Galvanized by fear of a common foe, the remaining nations joined in a clandestine alliance. Fortunately, the dreaded invasion never came and an uneasy peace prevailed. Thus it was that Eorzea slipped into the Age of Calm.<br /><br /> As the city-states continued to develop regular standing armies, a growing number of mercenaries and hedge knights found themselves without employment. Concerned at the rise in number of armed men and women resorting to acts of villainy to survive, several respected leaders gathered together to form a network of guilds. The guilds provided these lost souls with the chance to utilize their talents for the benefit of themselves and others.<br /><br /> Through the foresight and resolve of these leaders a new industry had emerged-and the Age of Adventure had begun."", '']","by

The Darkness II stands out visually with its distinctive graphic noir style, and it is the only first person shooter to feature Quad-Wielding : the ability to simultaneously utilize four different weapons. It's been two years since Jackie Estacado used the Darkness to kill the men responsible for his girlfriend's murder. He's been unable to shake the memory of Jenny's death since bottling up his supernatural power and now the Darkness wants out. A sudden, unprovoked attack on Jackie's life heralds the start of a full-scale mob war and opens the door for the Darkness to reemerge. The botched attempt sets Jackie on a journey to hell and worse as he unravels the mystery behind the attack and the motivations of the Darkness itself."", '<strong>Features:</strong>', '', '&#xa9; 2008-2011 Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

Any seasoned first person shooter player knows all too well that a sure path to defeat is being unable to hear clear signals from your squad or the approaching enemy. Wearing uncomfortable headsets for long periods of gameplay can lead to fatigue as well, but this headset is designed to address these factors, and provide comfort that can last through even the longest of campaigns. The Gaming Headset connects to a monitor or sound system with standard RCA stereo jacks (red and white) and directly to your console's USB port via separate cables, thus allowing users to adjust the volume of in-game audio and chat communication independently with the wired remote. The removable mic can also be easily muted with a simple switch on the remote so you don't have to worry about transmitting every word you say. When you really want to feel like you're on the battlefront and fully hear every distinct game detail, press the 3D Sound Effect button on the remote for a widened audio field that will surround you with the power of triple drivers in each ear. Not only does all this allow for a finely tuned and completely customized audio experience, but the audio quality itself is rich with the dynamic base that all serious gamers crave. You can finally hear subtle details that will give you the competitive advantage, or simply enjoy extended play sessions thanks to the comfortable padding.
