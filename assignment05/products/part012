But in the backwards world of demon scholastics where good is bad and bad is good, Mao is a top honor student. He knows all about ditching school, being totally unhelpful and quickly resorting to violence, but nothing of the selfless nobility and patience of heroes. Heroes are for delinquents, as the number one delinquent of the Nether Institute, Raspberyl and her friends try to tell him. But Mao&#146;s mind is made up. It\'s a hero he will be.<br/><br/><b>Flow of Gameplay: Events &rArr; Base &rArr; Battle &rArr; Repeat</b><br/><u>Events</u>: Players advance through the game as events unfold. These events can occur during the story, at your base, or before/after battles. You will be able to witness the fun and interesting interactions through a mixture of sprite animation and exciting character battles.<br/><br/><u>Base</u>: Mao\'s school, the Nether Institute, Evil Academy is the base point of the game. Players will be able to prepare for upcoming battles here by purchasing new weapons and items, customizing characters and/or restoring health.<br/><br/><u>Battle</u>: You will be fighting against enemies in battle scenes with a quarter view, tactical simulations. The goal is to defeat all of the enemies before all of your team members die. Battles utilize a turn-based system, where all of your team members will have their turn to attack before enemies begin theirs.<br/><br/><b>Character Customization: The Evility System</b><br/>Character customization is crucial in all role-playing games. <i>Absence of Justice</i> allows for maximum character customization through its ""Evility System."" There are two different categories of evilities: evility that is already set for each character depending upon the jobs of each and evility that players can customize. Customizable evilities include: evility to acquire the special skills for certain weapons, evility to up character status under certain requirements, evility to up the amount of experience points earned, evility to enable special skills and functions, etc. This variety is powerful and important. You may have only one kind of evility that supports a character\'s status, but you may have multiple evilities for skills. Use this system to create and customize your characters and ideally group multiple evilities in one to conduct battles more efficiently.<br/><br/><b>The <i>Disgaea 3</i> Battle System</b><br/>Combat in <i>Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice</i> consists of a combination of the franchises familiar standard system of attacks, along with a whole new array of moves debuting with the game. This wide range of possibilities allows players to pick and choose tactics that suit the immediate conflict before them or to quest for overall success in the game, and maximum fun by attemping to master all. Attacks and skills include:<ul><li><u>Team Attack</u> - Use up to four adjoining team members to help you attack adjoining enemies. Although this may seem random, it is actually closely connected with the team members you have selected in class and their special skills.</li><li><u>Combos</u> - Combos happen when multiple team members attack the same enemy during a single turn. They can occur even when team members are not on adjoining squares and their effectiveness increases with the number of occurring combos.</li><li><u>Lift and Throw</u> - Humanoid characters have the ability to lift and throw enemies or teammates. The distance of a throw depends on the thrower and lifted team members are safe from attack, making this a key defensive tactic.</li><li><u>Stack Attack</u> - If you keep using the lift command, you will be able to create a tower of characters. Select the attack command while in that state and all stacked characters will begin to attack. The larger the stack the higher the damage to your enemies.</li><li><u>Double Throw</u> - If one of your characters stacked in a tower selects the ""throw"" command you can choose to throw any of the stacked characters. This is a useful skill when you want to reach a floor that is too high to reach on your own. </li><li><u>Throw and Receive</u> - Useful in moving long distances, when you throw a character towards a monster teammate he/she will knock the thrown character further away in the direction faced.</li><li><u>Geo Effect</u> - The combination of geo panels and geo blocks is called the \'Geo Effect.\' The special effect of a block on top of a panel will affect all panels of the same color. You gain the power of those effects by landing on the right block.</li><li><u>Uniting Skills</u> - If you meet certain requirements during a combo, two skills will unite into one, increasing damage and depending on the skills will increase the effectiveness of your combo.</li><li><u>Magichange</u> - Magichange allows humanoid characters and monster characters to to fight as one. In doing this the monster will turn into a special weapon for the human to wield and in the process increase the power of both.</li></ul>Will Mao be able to become a hero and defeat the Overlord? Or will Raspberyl and the demon delinquents convince him to return to his honor role ways? It all depends on you, and so the troublesome, devilish story begins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>']","by

And each stage has multiple ""missions"" to keep you coming back again and again to unlock everything, collect more coins or just improve your best time.</li> <li><b>Classic Wario Action and Attitude</b> - Wario returns to form, with all the jumping, power-dashing and butt-stomping we\'ve come to expect. This is surly Wario at his finest.</li> </ul> <b>The Wii Remote: Powers, Weapons, Moves &amp; Vehicles</b><br> Wario can jump and dash, as per previous <i>Wario Land</i> games. New to this game is the ability to shake the Wii Remote for various effects. By default, a shake of the Wii Remote makes Wario punch the ground, causing a small earthquake and dazing enemies. Wario can then pick up dazed enemies and, with another shake of the Wii Remote, shake them for rejuvenating garlic and occasionally gold. Enemies can also be thrown, and you aim by tilting the Wii Remote.<p/> Wario also takes control of three different vehicles during the course of the game, all of which are piloted in part by tilting the Wii Remote. The controls are standard for a Wii Remote held sideways (D-pad, buttons), but with an important twist: most of Wario\'s special moves are accomplished by shaking or tilting the Wii Remote. This allows great versatility but without forcing the player to remember complicated button combinations. <p/>']","by

A major franchise in the RPG genre, MegaTen games take place in the contemporary or near-future Japan, mixing occult and cyberpunk elements. The games feature mythological references from multiple mythologies, and the player is often asked to make moral or philosophical choices that affect the game\'s storyline and ending.', ""The silent male protagonist who represents the player in Persona 4 attends Yasogami High School with Chie, Yosuke, and Yukiko. His entire personality and name is decided and portrayed by the player's in-game actions and decisions. He wields two-handed sword type weapons, but unlike Persona 3, he doesn't use alternative weapons."", '<strong>Mysterious Murders Abound</strong><br /> Persona 4 takes place in a rural town named Inaba where mysterious murders occur whenever there is fog after heavy rain. The town has a television channel that airs only at midnight called Mayonaka TV, during which it is said that one can see their ""other half"" while staring at the screen. After hearing about a recent unsolved murder, some characters realize that they had witnessed the murder victim while watching Mayonaka TV.', ""The protagonist discovers that during midnight when the channel is on, his body can phase into his television set, using the set as a gateway to another world infested with shadows.

The characters decide to solve the mysterious murders by exploring the hidden world of Mayonaka TV."", ""<strong>Brand-New Yet Familiar game play</strong><br /> Persona 4's game play and style are similar to the popular Persona 3.

Other changes include an increase in player stats from three to five, and the removal of health status, allowing players to explore dungeons continuously."", ""<strong>Let the Action Begin</strong><br /> Battle-wise, Persona 4 lets you directly control the actions of other party members and continually exploit an enemy's weakness. Post-battle card shuffles have added Arcana Chance, which bring you good or bad status depending on the Arcana. Battles now occur after school instead of at midnight, like in Persona 3, giving the player less time in which to do social activities. This turns out to be significant because Social Links now have a greater effect on battle."", ""At higher levels, the player's allies progress from occasionally protecting the protagonist from a deathblow, through occasionally offering follow-up attacks, to eventually allow the persona of the corresponding ally to evolve into another persona.

All allies who have their corresponding Social Link levels maxed out now have a chance to survive an otherwise fatal attack, leaving them with one remaining HP.""]","by

One way this is accomplished is by streamlining the RPG elements in exciting new ways. For example, rather than increasing arbitrary stats like 'Intelligence plus one', items and upgrades give Jason unique, tangible abilities like the Fist of Ares, which causes shields to explode, ripping apart nearby enemies. And individual battles aren't dependant upon a hit-point and dice system. If you manage to get behind a shield and slice into your enemies' neck, their head will be cleaved from their shoulders. The developers also spent time researching the look and feel of ancient Greek artwork, crafts and architecture for a richness of surrounding that is astonishing."", ""As in ancient Greece, in Rise of the Argonauts players must curry the favor of the Gods. As you achieve deeds, you can dedicate them to different gods. A god's favor will also be affected by choices you make in conversations with non-player characters. As your favor, or disfavor, with a particular god rises, your abilities will be affected accordingly. But be careful, because the gods like few things better than meddling in the lives of their human subjects."", '<b>Amazing Battles are Loads of Fun</b><br> The battle system in Rise of the Argonauts is simple enough to pick up quickly, but has more finesse than your typical button masher. In battling enemies you weaken their armor, then their limbs, eventually finishing them off. Weapons can be switched mid-battle to unleash devastating combos, while using god-granted powers can also cause serious damage. Players can also choose how to defeat their enemies, and in so doing find interesting new allies. For example, in one of your battles you will fight Medusa herself. If you kill her, her brother Perseus will grieve for her but join you on your quest. If you save Medusa, however, Athena will command her to join your crew as a beginning to her penance for her misdeeds.', 'In Rise of the Argonauts gamers will find a deep, and enthralling story that is matched only by the fun of playing it. With a wide range of upgradeable weapons, loads of different heroes to help you, gods to entreat, and an ever-changing story that is constantly affected by the choices you make, the possibilities seem endless. Add to that stunning visuals, a musical score created by film composer Tyler Bates, and a smooth blend of action and RPG that is new to the genre, and this is a game you simply must check out. <br clear=""all""> <center> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page//B001CBW18U-4-sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top><br><br> <span class=""caption"">You\'ll recognize characters from classic myths such as Medusa and her head of snakes.</class> </center> <br clear=""all"">']","by

The game keeps going for as long as you want to play, and your town will always be there when you return. Move into town, buy a house and then do whatever you want. Time and seasons pass as they do in the real world, so there\'s always something different happening. Collect more than 2,400 items, go fishing for rare and interesting fish, catch all kind of cool bugs, dig up dinosaur fossils and buried treasure, hang out with other players or spend the day in the city. There\'s so much to do, and you have all the time in the world to explore it all.<p/> <b>DS Suitcase Mode</b><br/> The DS Suitcase lets you carry your character from your Wii console to a friend\'s, thus giving people without an Internet connection the ability to experience multiplayer modes. Additionally, you can move your character from <i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i> on Nintendo DS and play as him/her in <i>Animal Crossing: City Folk</i>.<p/> <b>Key Game Features</b><br> <ul> <li><b>There\'s Always Something New To Do</b>: In the living, breathing world of <i>Animal Crossing: City Folk</i>, days and seasons pass in real time, so there\'s always something to discover. Catch fireflies in the summer, go trick-or-treating on Halloween or hunt for eggs on Bunny Day. If you\'re in the mood for something a little faster paced, take a bus to a new urban city area that\'s unique to <i>Animal Crossing: City Folk</i>. There you can catch a show at the theater or check out the sales at Gracie\'s boutique. But if you don\'t show your face back home for too long, your neighbors will miss you.</li> <li><b>Play With and Hear Up to Four Friends</b>: Up to four people from your household can live and work together to build the perfect town. Design clothes and patterns, write letters and post messages on the bulletin board for each other, or play online using your broadband connection and invite up to three friends to visit your town using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. With the new optional Wii Speak microphone (sold separately), it\'s like you\'re all in the same room. The microphone sits atop the sensor bar and picks up the conversation of everyone in the room to encourage a more inclusive experience.</li> <li><b>Get to Know Your Neighbors</b>: The heart of <i>Animal Crossing: City Folk</i> is building relationships with the animals in your town as well as with other players. Befriend your animal neighbors by exchanging letters, gifts and favors. Animals can also move from town to town, bringing their memories and stories from their old towns with them. And since animals are notoriously loose-lipped, they spill all the juicy details.</li> <li><b>Express Your Personal Style</b>: Customize your town, your house and yourself by collecting bugs, fish, fossils, art, furniture, clothes and accessories. You can also go to the salon in the city to change your hairstyle and get a Mii makeover. Plus, if you design clothes in the tailor\'s shop, animals will wear them and maybe even bring them to other towns.</li> </ul> <b>Your Neighbors</b><br> Familiar faces such as K.K. Slider, Tom Nook, Blathers and Mr. Resetti all appear, as well as a bunch of new characters like Festivale host Pav&eacute; and Bug-Off judge Bud. Many characters who occasionally visited your town in previous Animal Crossing games have now set up permanent shop in the city, so you can see them anytime.<p/> <b>Special Powers, Weapons, Moves &amp; Features</b>:<br/> Use the Wii Remote pointer to type letters, use items, draw designs for clothing or wallpaper, drag clothing or items onto your characters, interact with animals or objects, or lead your character around the world. Use Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to hang out in real time with up to three of your friends. You can also send them e-mails and text messages from the game. Play at different times of the year to experience different activities, holidays and seasons. And when visiting a friend in another country, experience the holidays native to their culture.<p/> <b>Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</b><br/> Up to four people can play together in real time via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. The host opens his or her gate to allow friends into the town, where they can perform all sorts of activities: fish, write letters to townsfolk, shop at the store, swap items, play hide-and-seek ... anything. Up to four players can interact in real-time, communicating via text chat, mic chat and emoticons.<p/> <b>WiiConnect24</b>:<br/> Using WiiConnect24, you can buy and sell items to friends by participating in silent auctions, view actual players\' homes in the Happy Room Academy office or send letters to other players\' towns. <p/>']","by

You play B.J. Blazkowicz, a highly decorated member of the Office of Secret Actions (OSA). You are sent on a special mission into the heart of the Third Reich to investigate evidence of the Nazi\'s possession of a new and mysterious power. But while behind enemy lines, you discover they have done much more than develop a new weapon. The Nazis are attempting to harness the supernatural power of an enormous energy source called \'Black Sun\' which resides in a parallel dimension called \'The Veil.\' Their goal is to use what they find to create supernatural weapons and soldiers of war-ending magnitude. Yours is to stop that from happening by any mean necessary. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Even though the game obviously features loads of Nazi enemies, <i>Wolfenstein</i> is not so much a World War II game, as a game centered around ""dark science"" and ""Supernatural Science fiction."" In it players move between the the parallel dimension of the Veil and that of our own as they command an enormous arsenal of conventional weapons or unleash the Nazi\'s own dark powers and perverted science against them with supernatural weapons and Veil-enhanced firepower. One of the major strengths of <i>Wolfenstein</i> is that it allows you to choose the way you want to play. Although as in previous games in the series B.J. Is a one man wrecking crew, he also works with a local resistance group. This means that players have the choice to follow the standard missions as they are revealed, take on requests from the resistance to explore the gameplay area and investigate the Nazi experiments, or to tackle the whole endeavor in multiplayer mode. <p/> <b>Veil Power</b><br/> A huge part of <i>Wolfenstein\'s</i> sci-fi identification comes via gameplay that relies on the accumulation and use of a number of \'Veil Powers\'. These powers though supernatural in origin, are used in large part by B.J. To magnify the effectiveness of his conventional weaponry and tactics. A sampling of these powers include: \'Mire,\' which allows you to slow down time around B.J. So that he can take out enemies and obstructions such as machine gun nests, without the risk of taking severe damage; \'Veil Sight,\' a sort of supernatural night vision that helps you see enemies in the dark; and \'Veil Shield,\' which absorbs bullet fire and can be used as a battering ram in some circumstances. As with all the weapons in the game, all Veil Powers can be upgraded and indeed must be in some cases to proceed through the game. A notable caveat that comes along with the mastery of Veil Powers is that they do not necessarily guarantee overall success. As the game proceeds, the Nazis become aware of B.J. And his understanding and use of these powers and in response distribute \'Veil Inhibitors,\' devices that negate the use of these Veil-powered abilities within range of them. This opens up a puzzle-solving aspect within <i>Wolfenstein</i> that require players to explore the environments around them to find the inhibitors and destroy them in order to proceed. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Amazing Enemies</b> - You never know what ferocious enemies the Nazis will throw at you next as they bring their dark fantasies to life.</li> <li><b>Epic Combat Moments</b> - Experience movie-like epic action sequences as you fight to prevent the Nazis from unleashing the power of the Black Sun, a war-ending weapon of supernatural mass destruction. </li> <li><b>Unique Environments</b> - Explore the mysteries of The Veil, a world between our reality and the occult underworld that offers you combat advantages but also new supernatural threats.</li> <li><b>Impressive Firepower</b> - Go to battle with a diverse collection of Allied, Axis and experimental Nazi weapons. Earn gold by working with the resistance fighters, purchase upgrades in the black market, and customize your personal arsenal.</li> <li><b>Classic Wolfenstein Multiplayer with an Occult Twist</b> - Revisit the heart-pounding and award winning class and objective based multiplayer of <i>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</i>; now with occult-enhanced firepower.</li> </ul> <b>Weapons</b><br/> <i>Wolfenstein</i> features a wide array of Allied, Axis and supernatural Nazi weapons. All of these can be upgraded using treasure in the form of gold, military intelligence and mystical tomes found throughout the game via the in-game black market. This escalation of firepower is important in order to match the growing power of mini-bosses and bosses faced with each successive game level. <h4>System Requirements:</h4><table border=1 cellpadding=""3"" align=""center""><tr> <td width=""16%""></td> <td width=""42%"" colspan=""2"" align=center><b>Minimum Specifications:</b></td> <tr> <td width=""18%"">OS:</td> <td colspan=2 align=center>Windows Vista/Window XP</td> </tr><tr> <td width=""18%"">Processor:</td> <td colspan=""2"" align=center>Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 3.2 GHz or AMD Athlon(TM) 64 3400+ processor</td> </tr><tr> <td width=""18%"">RAM:</td> <td colspan=""2"" align=center>1GB</td> </tr><tr> <td valign=""top"" width=""18%"">Video Card:</td> <td colspan=""2"" align=center>256MB NVIDIA(R) Geforce(R) 6800 GT or ATI Radeon(TM) X800 </td> </tr><tr> <td width=""18%"">DirectX:</td> <td colspan=2 align=center>9.0c (included & required for Windows XP &amp; Vista)</td> </tr><tr> <td width=""18%"">Hard Drive Space:</td> <td colspan=2 align=center>8GB (Plus an additional 800MB for Windows swap file)</td> </tr><tr> <td width=""18%"">Sound Card:</td> <td colspan=2 align=center>100% DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=""18%"">Other:</td> <td colspan=2 align=center>Broadband connection and service required for multiplayer</td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Your actions are then spliced into short, knee-slapping films that highlight the unique and often far-fetched talents of your friends and family. Each performance is certain to incite riotous laughter, but the best part is you'll never run out of options with You're in the Movie's massive collection of clips, snippets, scripts, and characters. And since you're running the show, no clip will be quite the same and no scene ever ends up on the cutting room floor. Playing You're in the Movies is your time to be the star."", '<b>Become a B-Movie Superstar</b><br> You\'re in the Movies gives players a choice of fun and kitschy scripts -- there\'s no talk of highbrow writing here -- but a B-movie star like yourself can\'t be too picky. Your character of choice might be an action hero or silent film star, but it doesn\'t really matter. Just pick a genre, pick a script, and get on the set, because the director is ready to call ""Action!""', '<b>Beat out the Competition in Casting Call</b><br> Casting Call is another game play option. In this mode, up to four people can try to take the spotlight and play starring roles. During this game play mode a director guides actors through their roles with simple instructions and quick feedback. In fact, each actor will receive a rating based on physical performance. This scoring system creates fun competition and keeps players from getting too lazy.', '<b>Take over the Director\'s Chair</b><br> Jump into Director Mode and cut a trailer for the movie you just made. Getting the distribution deal (even if it is straight-to-DVD) is great, but unless you have a solid trailer, no one will ever go see your flick. Head off to the editing room and pull together all the great moments to impress your future audience. It\'s really quite impressive. With the Xbox LIVE Vision camera you can capture player movements using a green-screen-type technology. You\'re in the Movies allows you to document, save, share, and relive all the best and most hilarious performances. <br clear=""all""> <center> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001CMLKRW-1-lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=677,height=365\'); return false;""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001CMLKRW-1-sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top></a> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001CMLKRW-2-lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=677,height=365\'); return false;""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001CMLKRW-2-sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top></a> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001CMLKRW-3-lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=677,height=365\'); return false;""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001CMLKRW-3-sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top></a> </center> <br clear=""all"">']","by

These subjects have different professions which come in handy in specific as well as general quest scenarios and should be chosen wisely. Additional training facilities can be constructed to retrain existing subjects as well as those that are added to your kingdom as it prospers and eventually needs to expand into surrounding territories. <p/> The world of <i>Little King\'s Story</i> is expansive and set on many levels. Although each level contains multiple possible boss battles, progression through the game levels always requires the defeat of a substantial boss. Battles become more intense as you set out to conquer the lands that surround your kingdom, although these are never too overbearing due to the game\'s easy to alter difficulty settings. As these campaigns against neighboring kingdoms proceed you are kept aware of the health and happiness of your subjects at home and that of your troops via an information bar at the top left, as well as a ticker scrolling across the screen. Balance their needs with the needs of an expanding kingdom and you may indeed become the best king ever. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>High Production Values</b> - An original game built from the ground up for the Wii by a seasoned development team.</li> <li><b>Accessible Controls</b> - Give commands and control your townspeople to a wide variety of tasks with ease.</li> <li><b>People Power</b> - Have your townspeople dig for treasures, build new buildings, and break obstacles to access new areas &ndash; all in the name of bettering your kingdom.</li> <li><b>Distinct and Lively Villagers</b> - Each NPC (Non-Playable Character) in your village is unique with individual likes, dislikes, and personal memories which evolve based on their daily experiences.</li> <li><b>Multiple Sub-quests</b> - Any good king puts the welfare of his subjects before himself, so help your villagers by accepting some of their requests.</li> <li><b>Expand Your Kingdom</b> - Unite the surrounding rival kingdoms under your flag to become the best king in the world.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

A veteran of the struggle against the Chimera in Britain following their conquest of the European continent, he did not escape those battles unwounded. Months prior to his entrance into the game, while leading an attack on a Chimera conversion facility--locations where humans are changed into monstrous slaves serving the Chimera--he was forced to kill his own brother in order to keep him from turning into one of these abominations. Following this Grayson goes on a vendetta to destroy every conversion center he can find, eventually even deserting his unit to fulfill his lust for revenge, a crime which he would be locked up for. Unfortunately, for all his compulsion, success and sacrifice Grayson learns that his efforts have been futile. In Western Europe the Chimera have evolved a new method of converting humans, one about which nearly nothing is known. Aware of his experience with the Chimera, the European resistance--the Maquis--enlist Grayson\'s help, and he joins Cartwright and Parker in Operation Overstrike, and so the war to retake the European continent and the game begins. <p/> <p/> <b>Advanced Targeting and Cover System</b><br/> With easy access to a weapons inventory, reloading commands, intel and player movement options, gameplay in <i>Resistance: Retribution</i> is easy to pick up and generally similar to many third-person shooters on the PSP platform, but two things also make it a stand out, its advanced targeting and cover system. Unlike many other games that limit players to manual firing, <i>Resistance: Retribution</i> gives players the option of aim assist. Accessible quickly through the options menu, this allows players the choice of automatically locking on to the closest enemy target, to target manually or toggle between the two. Similarly, unlike other games that require you to push a button to lock you to a piece of game environment to be used as cover, here that is automatic. Just walk up to to a wall or ledge and Grayson will duck behind it automatically and will stay ducked even as he creeps from side to side. And since aim assist is constantly active you are also able to time your fire and weapon switching from the safety of cover.<p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li>A stand alone third person action shooter created exclusively for the PSP that continues the <i>Resistance</i> saga in Europe.</li> <li>An advanced third-person targeting system designed specifically for the PSP provides an unparalleled portable shooter experience.</li> <li>Intense eight player multiplayer gameplay with five game modes including Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Containment and Assimilation available via ad-hoc and infrastructure.</li> <li>With Resistance Connect, you can plug your PSP into your PS3 with <i>Resistance 2</i> and unlock additional features and content.</li> <li>With <i>Resistance: Retribution</i> Plus, experience the game in a brand new way by using your DUALSHOCK 3 wireless controller.</li> <li>Developed by the critically acclaimed Bend Studio using their 3rd generation PSP game engine.</li> <li>Over 10 different types of enemies, including Chimera from <i>Resistance 2</i> and <i>Resistance: Fall of Man</i> &ndash; including the Titan, Slipskull, Hybrids and Leapers &ndash; and all new enemies like the Hag and Cloven.</li> </ul> <b>Game Modes</b><br/> One of the things that sets <i>Resistance: Retribution</i> apart from other shooters on the PSP is the variety of ways to play. Along with a compelling singleplayer campaign it also comes packed with multiplayer options that wirelessly support up to eight players in both ad hoc and infrastructure configurations. Along with familiar modes such as Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag, players will also enjoy two modes called Containment and Assimilation. In addition, players who have a PS3 and a copy of <i>Resistance 2</i> will also have access to two additional modes, ""Infected Mode"" and ""Resistance Retribution Plus"" via the <i>""Resistance</i> Connect"" game feature. To access <i>Resistance</i> Connect, players simply load their copies of <i>Resistance: Retribution</i> and <i>Resistance 2</i>, then connect your PSP system to your PS3. Once you&rsquo;re connected, <i>Resistance: Retribution</i> becomes ""infected."" <p/> <u>Infected Mode</u><br/> Infected Mode provides an alternate story within <i>Resistance: Retribution</i>. While in prison for desertion, James Grayson is recruited by Specter Lieutenant David LaSalle (from <i>Resistance 2</i>) and is infected with a mutated version of the Chimera virus, a different version of the virus than the virus that infects Nathan Hale. While playing in Infected Mode, Grayson wears a SRPA uniform and now has glowing Chimera eyes. Grayson now has regenerative health and can breathe underwater. The HE .44 Magnum from <i>Resistance 2</i>, which fires explosive rounds that can be triggered remotely becomes available as a weapon. An entirely new class of intelligence also becomes available that is hidden throughout the levels. Collecting all of the ""infected"" intel will unlock another <i>Resistance 2</i> weapon, Plasma Grenades. In addition, thanks to your new Chimera DNA you will have access to areas of the game previously unavailable, as well as experience new AI interactions with the characters you meet through out the game play. <p/> <u>Resistance: Retribution Plus</u><br/> <i>Resistance: Retribution</i> Plus allows you to play the game using your PS3\'s DUALSHOCK 3 controller, while adding dual analog stick controls and rumble support. Simply activate this feature through <i>Resistance 2</i>, and then play the game on your PSP screen or through your televisions using the available video out function. This mode increases the challenge level and disables aim assist, allowing you to experience the game in an entirely new way. <p/>']","by

You play B.J. Blazkowicz, a highly decorated member of the Office of Secret Actions (OSA). You are sent on a special mission into the heart of the Third Reich to investigate evidence of the Nazi\'s possession of a new and mysterious power. But while behind enemy lines, you discover they have done much more than develop a new weapon. The Nazis are attempting to harness the supernatural power of an enormous energy source called \'Black Sun\' which resides in a parallel dimension called \'The Veil.\' Their goal is to use what they find to create supernatural weapons and soldiers of war-ending magnitude. Yours is to stop that from happening by any mean necessary. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Even though the game obviously features loads of Nazi enemies, <i>Wolfenstein</i> is not so much a World War II game, as a game centered around ""dark science"" and ""Supernatural Science fiction."" In it players move between the the parallel dimension of the Veil and that of our own as they command an enormous arsenal of conventional weapons or unleash the Nazi\'s own dark powers and perverted science against them with supernatural weapons and Veil-enhanced firepower. <p/> One of the major strengths of <i>Wolfenstein</i> is that it allows you to choose the way you want to play. Although as in previous games in the series B.J. is a one man wrecking crew, he also works with a local resistance group. This means that players have the choice to follow the standard missions as they are revealed, take on requests from the resistance to explore the gameplay area and investigate the Nazi experiments, or to tackle the whole endeavor in multiplayer mode. <p/> <b>Veil Power</b><br/> A huge part of <i>Wolfenstein\'s</i> sci-fi identification comes via gameplay that relies on the accumulation and use of a number of \'Veil Powers\'. These powers though supernatural in origin, are used in large part by B.J. to magnify the effectiveness of his conventional weaponry and tactics. A sampling of these powers include: \'Mire,\' which allows you to slow down time around B.J. so that he can take out enemies and obstructions such as machine gun nests, without the risk of taking severe damage; \'Veil Sight,\' a sort of supernatural night vision that helps you see enemies in the dark; and \'Veil Shield,\' which absorbs bullet fire and can be used as a battering ram in some circumstances. As with all the weapons in the game, all Veil Powers can be upgraded and indeed must be in some cases to proceed through the game. <p/> A notable caveat that comes along with the mastery of Veil Powers is that they do not necessarily guarantee overall success. As the game proceeds, the Nazis become aware of B.J. and his understanding and use of these powers and in response distribute \'Veil Inhibitors,\' devices that negate the use of these Veil-powered abilities within range of them. This opens up a puzzle-solving aspect within <i>Wolfenstein</i> that require players to explore the environments around them to find the inhibitors and destroy them in order to proceed. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Amazing Enemies</b> - You never know what ferocious enemies the Nazis will throw at you next as they bring their dark fantasies to life.</li> <li><b>Epic Combat Moments</b> - Experience movie-like epic action sequences as you fight to prevent the Nazis from unleashing the power of the Black Sun, a war-ending weapon of supernatural mass destruction. </li> <li><b>Unique Environments</b> - Explore the mysteries of The Veil, a world between our reality and the occult underworld that offers you combat advantages but also new supernatural threats.</li> <li><b>Impressive Firepower</b> - Go to battle with a diverse collection of Allied, Axis and experimental Nazi weapons. Earn gold by working with the resistance fighters, purchase upgrades in the black market, and customize your personal arsenal.</li> <li><b>Classic Wolfenstein Multiplayer with an Occult Twist</b> - Revisit the heart-pounding and award winning class and objective based multiplayer of <i>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</i>; now with occult-enhanced firepower.</li> </ul> <b>Weapons</b><br/> <i>Wolfenstein</i> features a wide array of Allied, Axis and supernatural Nazi weapons. All of these can be upgraded using treasure in the form of gold, military intelligence and mystical tomes found throughout the game via the in-game black market. This escalation of firepower is important in order to match the growing power of mini-bosses and bosses faced with each successive game level. </td> </tr> </table>']","by

You play B.J. Blazkowicz, a highly decorated member of the Office of Secret Actions (OSA). You are sent on a special mission into the heart of the Third Reich to investigate evidence of the Nazi\'s possession of a new and mysterious power. But while behind enemy lines, you discover they have done much more than develop a new weapon. The Nazis are attempting to harness the supernatural power of an enormous energy source called \'Black Sun\' which resides in a parallel dimension called \'The Veil.\' Their goal is to use what they find to create supernatural weapons and soldiers of war-ending magnitude. Yours is to stop that from happening by any mean necessary. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Even though the game obviously features loads of Nazi enemies, <i>Wolfenstein</i> is not so much a World War II game, as a game centered around ""dark science"" and ""Supernatural Science fiction."" In it players move between the the parallel dimension of the Veil and that of our own as they command an enormous arsenal of conventional weapons or unleash the Nazi\'s own dark powers and perverted science against them with supernatural weapons and Veil-enhanced firepower. <p/> One of the major strengths of <i>Wolfenstein</i> is that it allows you to choose the way you want to play. Although as in previous games in the series B.J. Is a one man wrecking crew, he also works with a local resistance group. This means that players have the choice to follow the standard missions as they are revealed, take on requests from the resistance to explore the gameplay area and investigate the Nazi experiments, or to tackle the whole endeavor in multiplayer mode. <p/> <b>Veil Power</b><br/> A huge part of <i>Wolfenstein\'s</i> sci-fi identification comes via gameplay that relies on the accumulation and use of a number of \'Veil Powers\'. These powers though supernatural in origin, are used in large part by B.J. To magnify the effectiveness of his conventional weaponry and tactics. A sampling of these powers include: \'Mire,\' which allows you to slow down time around B.J. So that he can take out enemies and obstructions such as machine gun nests, without the risk of taking severe damage; \'Veil Sight,\' a sort of supernatural night vision that helps you see enemies in the dark; and \'Veil Shield,\' which absorbs bullet fire and can be used as a battering ram in some circumstances. As with all the weapons in the game, all Veil Powers can be upgraded and indeed must be in some cases to proceed through the game. <p/> A notable caveat that comes along with the mastery of Veil Powers is that they do not necessarily guarantee overall success. As the game proceeds, the Nazis become aware of B.J. And his understanding and use of these powers and in response distribute \'Veil Inhibitors,\' devices that negate the use of these Veil-powered abilities within range of them. This opens up a puzzle-solving aspect within <i>Wolfenstein</i> that require players to explore the environments around them to find the inhibitors and destroy them in order to proceed. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Amazing Enemies</b> - You never know what ferocious enemies the Nazis will throw at you next as they bring their dark fantasies to life.</li> <li><b>Epic Combat Moments</b> - Experience movie-like epic action sequences as you fight to prevent the Nazis from unleashing the power of the Black Sun, a war-ending weapon of supernatural mass destruction. </li> <li><b>Unique Environments</b> - Explore the mysteries of The Veil, a world between our reality and the occult underworld that offers you combat advantages but also new supernatural threats.</li> <li><b>Impressive Firepower</b> - Go to battle with a diverse collection of Allied, Axis and experimental Nazi weapons. Earn gold by working with the resistance fighters, purchase upgrades in the black market, and customize your personal arsenal.</li> <li><b>Classic Wolfenstein Multiplayer with an Occult Twist</b> - Revisit the heart-pounding and award winning class and objective based multiplayer of <i>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</i>; now with occult-enhanced firepower.</li> </ul> <b>Weapons</b><br/> <i>Wolfenstein</i> features a wide array of Allied, Axis and supernatural Nazi weapons. All of these can be upgraded using treasure in the form of gold, military intelligence and mystical tomes found throughout the game via the in-game black market. This escalation of firepower is important in order to match the growing power of mini-bosses and bosses faced with each successive game level. </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world. <p/><br/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> The largest DS game to date, <i>Chinatown Wars</i> is set in the <i>Grand Theft Auto IV</i>-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game\'s rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family\'s position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In true <i>GTA</i> fashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game\'s 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in other <i>GTA</i> releases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your \'wanted rating\' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS\' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player\'s choosing. <p/> <b>Cars and Controls</b><br/> Cars and control schemes play a prominent role in <i>Chinatown Wars</i>. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS\' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme in <i>Chinatown Wars</i> utilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>The Largest DS Game Ever</b> - Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.</li> <li><b>Endless Gameplay</b> - Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.</li> <li><b>Street Economics</b> - Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.</li> <li><b>Play with Friends</b> - Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.</li> <li><b>Bragging Rights</b> - Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.</li> <li><b>PDA Interface</b> - Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.</li> </ul> <b>Online Bragging Rights and Multiplayer</b><br/> Care has been taken to ensure that players can share their <i>Chinatown Wars</i> experiences with friends and fellow players in different ways. First, players will have access to the <i>Chinatown Wars</i> as well as the greater <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> communities through the Rockstar Games Social Club. Here they can chat, trade commodities, purchase special in-game items with in-game currency, check the leaderboards and compete in online tournaments. The DS\' Wi-Fi capabilities also gives players the opportunity to take their game online as they battle for supremacy in their own little corner of Liberty City in both head-to-head and co-op multiplayer battles. <p/> <p/>']","by

Ideally these combination of disciplines are used to devastate an opponent, but if used wisely they can also be used to frustrate and neutralize the power and tactics of a stronger fighter who can\'t be knocked out. <i>UFC 2009 Undisputed</i> features the six international fighting disciplines that are used in the UFC. These six fall into two categories, striking disciplines and grappling disciplines, and include: <p/> <blockquote> <b>Striking disciplines</b>: <ol> <u>Western Boxing (Boxing)</u> - Boxing relies on complex foot maneuvers and quick jabs to mount a powerful offense.<br/> <u>Kick Boxing</u> - Kick Boxing is a fighting style that integrates boxing punches with a variety of martial art kicks.<br/> <u>Muay Thai</u> - Also known as \'Thai Boxing,\' Muay Thai utilizes elbows, knees and low kicks often from the clinch position.<br/> </ol> <b>Grappling disciplines</b>: <ol> <u>Wrestling</u> - The oldest sport known to man, Wrestling consists of taking down your opponent using hand-to-hand maneuvers.<br/> <u>Judo</u> - Judo is a Japanese martial art that emphasizes on throwing your opponent and immobilizing him with grappling moves.<br/> <u>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</u> - Derived from Kodokan Judo, BJJ utilizes joint locks and choke holds to allow smaller/weaker combatants to defeat bigger, stronger opponents.<br/> </ol> </blockquote> <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Gameplay in <i>UFC 2009 Undisputed</i> is designed to be the most authentic representation of mixed martial arts in a video game to date. To do this the game utilizes the six fighting disciplines to help the player develop actual strategies used by UFC fighters. Each playable fighter is initially assigned one striking and one grapple martial discipline. The fighting strategies that come out of these make up a player\'s \'standing game\' and \'ground game,\' with the standing game reflecting your striking discipline and ground game your grapple. <p/> The standing game consists of utilizing the precision of your striking style to breakdown your opponent with quick combos, kicks from the perimeter or knees and elbows in the clinch. After these have done their work you unleash your power and go for the knockout. The ground game on the other hand consists of knocking your opponent off balance, taking him down to the canvas and there going for a tap out via submission hold or securing dominant position and pounding away until it is over. In developing a ground game players will learn to use <i>UFC 2009 Undisputed</i>\'s \'ultimate fighting control\' game mechanic. This innovative control system initiated through the right stick, allows players to transition their fighter while on the ground from one advantageous physical position to the next. This control is available to both combatants while on the ground, so as players seek for optimal positioning they must also beware of counter moves. Regardless which strategy is preferred, players must acknowledge both. Although players may feasibly survive and even progress for a while using just the standing or ground game, sooner or later the in-game competition will demand the development of both. <p/> <b>Roster of Fighters</b><br/> A big part of <i>UFC 2009 Undisputed</i>\'s dedication to realism is its extensive list of playable UFC fighters and other in-game characters familiar from the real-life world of Ultimate Fighting. The game features 80 headline fighters, 16 from each of the UFC\'s five weight divisions. Fighters available include such notables as Brock Lesnar, Chuck Liddell, Anderson Silva, George St. Pierre, BJ Penn and many many more. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/ufc2009.fighters.html"">Click here</a> to see an example of their bios.

So, whether classic WrestleMania action for you is the old school showdown between Andre the Giant and Hogan at WrestleMania III, the heated battle between ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and The Rock at WrestleMania XV, or anything in between, if you are a professional wrestling fan <i>WWE Legends of WrestleMania</i> is for you. <p/> <b>WrestleMania Tour Mode - The 3 ""RS""</b><br/> In WrestleMania Tour Mode players are given a choice of how they want to experience the events of the first 15 WrestleManias.

Completion of these objectives earns players points, which contribute to the various Xbox LIVE achievements accessible through the game.

All that remains is the search for the truth behind his betrayal and the survival of its consequences. <p/> <b>The Story</b><br/> Deceived by the forces of evil into prematurely bringing about the end of the world, War - the first Horseman of the Apocalypse - stands accused of breaking the sacred law by inciting a war between heaven and hell. Dishonored and stripped of his powers, War must return to Earth to search for the truth and punish those responsible. But there is no clear definition of good and evil in this tale. Hunted by a vengeful group of angels, War must take on the forces of Hell, forge uneasy alliances with the very demons he hunts, and journey across the ravaged remains of the Earth on his quest for vindication. But the answers he seeks will reveal a deep conspiracy in which War will find, and have to resign himself to the reality that although once the hand of God, he is just a pawn in the eternal battle between heaven and hell. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> A mix of exploration and fast-paced action gameplay, <i>Darksiders</i> is based on nonlinear play situations. That means that as War slowly regains his previous powers of destruction and carnage in order to continue his search for the origins and reasons for his betrayal, players will be able to backtrack to areas and scenarios that they may have left unexplored upon first discovery. Almost all areas of the game can be explored and some of the things players will find as they do so are treasure chests, health chests, and bonus life points, etc. The ability to go back and explore areas is important, especially as the game progresses and War finds himself up against enemies whose defeat require special skills and/or weaponry. <p/> As for combat gameplay, <i>Darksiders</i> features a variety of weapons--including blades and firearms--that can be used in combo moves or in single strikes. Some of these can be charged up for quick, but devastating attacks on enemies and all can be arranged on your controller\'s D-pad for easy and preferred access. Additional gameplay elements include the ability/necessity to fight from the back of your mount, Ruin, and the collection of the souls in the form of glowing orbs that fall to the ground as enemies are dispatched. The latter can be used to level up War with new items and abilities. <p/> <b>Varied Characters and Environments</b><br/> Although players take on the imposing role or War, <i>Darksiders</i> also contains a wide variety of equally intriguing and sometimes frightening characters. These include: an assortment of vengeful angels; demons, such as ""the Jailer"" whose body is made up of the remains of countless cadavers; a bestiary of wicked and vile creatures created to bolster the armies of hell on Earth; and Ruin, the trusty steed of War. Gameplay environments players will experience are equally varied, and include areas both underground and on the surface, that call to mind both familiar, if ruined modern urban environments, as well as ones seemingly pulled from the nightmarish scenes of the biblical apocalypse. <p/> <b>Key Features</b><br/> <ul> <li><b>Apocalyptic Power of War</b> - Unleash the wrath of War, combining brutal attacks and supernatural abilities to decimate all who stand in your way.</li> <li><b>Extreme Arsenal</b> - Wield a devastating arsenal of angelic, demonic, and Earthly weapons, and blaze a trail of destruction atop Ruin, War\'s fiery phantom steed.</li> <li><b>Epic Quest</b> - Battle across the wastelands and demon-infested dungeons of the decimated Earth in your quest for vengeance and redemption.</li> <li><b>Character Progression</b> - Uncover powerful ancient relics, upgrade your weapons, unlock new abilities, and customize your gameplay style.</li> <li><b>Battle Heaven and Hell</b> - Battle against all who stand in your way&mdash;from war-weary angelic forces to hell\'s hideous demon hordes.</li> <li><b>Weapons and Gear</b> - <i>Darksiders</i> features an extensive arsenal and inventory of weapons and gear.</li> <li><b>Varied Play Environments</b> - Players will fight through varied environments, including those above and underground, and modern and nightmarishly mythical in design.</li> <li><b>Xbox LIVE</b> - Although a single player game, <i>Darksiders</i> features Xbox LIVE achievements, content downloads and other features to heighten the gameplay experience.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Fighting Styles</b><br/> Success in mixed martial arts in real-life is all about a fighter\'s ability to combine different aspects of various fighting disciplines to his advantage when inside the octagon and that is exactly what players will need to do in <i>UFC 2009 Undisputed</i>. Ideally these combination of disciplines are used to devastate an opponent, but if used wisely they can also be used to frustrate and neutralize the power and tactics of a stronger fighter who can\'t be knocked out. <i>UFC 2009 Undisputed</i> features the six international fighting disciplines that are used in the UFC. These six fall into two categories, striking disciplines and grappling disciplines, and include: <p/> <blockquote> <b>Striking disciplines</b>: <ol> <u>Western Boxing (Boxing)</u> - Boxing relies on complex foot maneuvers and quick jabs to mount a powerful offense.<br/> <u>Kick Boxing</u> - Kick Boxing is a fighting style that integrates boxing punches with a variety of martial art kicks.<br/> <u>Muay Thai</u> - Also known as \'Thai Boxing,\' Muay Thai utilizes elbows, knees and low kicks often from the clinch position.<br/> </ol> <b>Grappling disciplines</b>: <ol> <u>Wrestling</u> - The oldest sport known to man, Wrestling consists of taking down your opponent using hand-to-hand maneuvers.<br/> <u>Judo</u> - Judo is a Japanese martial art that emphasizes on throwing your opponent and immobilizing him with grappling moves.<br/> <u>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</u> - Derived from Kodokan Judo, BJJ utilizes joint locks and choke holds to allow smaller/weaker combatants to defeat bigger, stronger opponents.<br/> </ol> </blockquote> <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Gameplay in <i>UFC 2009 Undisputed</i> is designed to be the most authentic representation of mixed martial arts in a video game to date. To do this the game utilizes the six fighting disciplines to help the player develop actual strategies used by UFC fighters. Each playable fighter is initially assigned one striking and one grapple martial discipline. The fighting strategies that come out of these make up a player\'s \'standing game\' and \'ground game,\' with the standing game reflecting your striking discipline and ground game your grapple. <p/> The standing game consists of utilizing the precision of your striking style to breakdown your opponent with quick combos, kicks from the perimeter or knees and elbows in the clinch. After these have done their work you unleash your power and go for the knockout. The ground game on the other hand consists of knocking your opponent off balance, taking him down to the canvas and there going for a tap out via submission hold or securing dominant position and pounding away until it is over. In developing a ground game players will learn to use <i>UFC 2009 Undisputed</i>\'s \'ultimate fighting control\' game mechanic. This innovative control system initiated through the right stick, allows players to transition their fighter while on the ground from one advantageous physical position to the next. This control is available to both combatants while on the ground, so as players seek for optimal positioning they must also beware of counter moves. Regardless which strategy is preferred, players must acknowledge both. Although players may feasibly survive and even progress for a while using just the standing or ground game, sooner or later the in-game competition will demand the development of both. <p/> <b>Roster of Fighters</b><br/> A big part of <i>UFC 2009 Undisputed</i>\'s dedication to realism is its extensive list of playable UFC fighters and other in-game characters familiar from the real-life world of Ultimate Fighting. The game features 80 headline fighters, 16 from each of the UFC\'s five weight divisions. Fighters available include such notables as Brock Lesnar, Chuck Liddell, Anderson Silva, George St. Pierre, BJ Penn and many many more. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/ufc2009.fighters.html"">Click here</a> to see an example of fighter bios.

All that remains is the search for the truth behind his betrayal and the survival of its consequences. <p/> <b>The Story</b><br/> Deceived by the forces of evil into prematurely bringing about the end of the world, War - the first Horseman of the Apocalypse - stands accused of breaking the sacred law by inciting a war between heaven and hell. Dishonored and stripped of his powers, War must return to Earth to search for the truth and punish those responsible. But there is no clear definition of good and evil in this tale. Hunted by a vengeful group of angels, War must take on the forces of Hell, forge uneasy alliances with the very demons he hunts, and journey across the ravaged remains of the Earth on his quest for vindication. But the answers he seeks will reveal a deep conspiracy in which War will find, and have to resign himself to the reality that although once the hand of God, he is just a pawn in the eternal battle between heaven and hell. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> A mix of exploration and fast-paced action gameplay, <i>Darksiders</i> is based on nonlinear play situations. That means that as War slowly regains his previous powers of destruction and carnage in order to continue his search for the origins and reasons for his betrayal, players will be able to backtrack to areas and scenarios that they may have left unexplored upon first discovery. Almost all areas of the game can be explored and some of the things players will find as they do so are treasure chests, health chests, and bonus life points, etc. The ability to go back and explore areas is important, especially as the game progresses and War finds himself up against enemies whose defeat require special skills and/or weaponry. <p/> As for combat gameplay, <i>Darksiders</i> features a variety of weapons--including blades and firearms--that can be used in combo moves or in single strikes. Some of these can be charged up for quick, but devastating attacks on enemies and all can be arranged on your controller\'s D-pad for easy and preferred access. Additional gameplay elements include the ability/necessity to fight from the back of your mount, Ruin, and the collection of the souls in the form of glowing orbs that fall to the ground as enemies are dispatched. The latter can be used to level up War with new items and abilities. <p/> <b>Varied Characters and Environments</b><br/> Although players take on the imposing role or War, <i>Darksiders</i> also contains a wide variety of equally intriguing and sometimes frightening characters. These include: an assortment of vengeful angels; demons, such as ""the Jailer"" whose body is made up of the remains of countless cadavers; a bestiary of wicked and vile creatures created to bolster the armies of hell on Earth; and Ruin, the trusty steed of War. Gameplay environments players will experience are equally varied, and include areas both underground and on the surface, that call to mind both familiar, if ruined modern urban environments, as well as ones seemingly pulled from the nightmarish scenes of the biblical apocalypse. <p/> <b>Key Features</b><br/> <ul> <li><b>Apocalyptic Power of War</b> - Unleash the wrath of War, combining brutal attacks and supernatural abilities to decimate all who stand in your way.</li> <li><b>Extreme Arsenal</b> - Wield a devastating arsenal of angelic, demonic, and Earthly weapons, and blaze a trail of destruction atop Ruin, War\'s fiery phantom steed.</li> <li><b>Epic Quest</b> - Battle across the wastelands and demon-infested dungeons of the decimated Earth in your quest for vengeance and redemption.</li> <li><b>Character Progression</b> - Uncover powerful ancient relics, upgrade your weapons, unlock new abilities, and customize your gameplay style.</li> <li><b>Battle Heaven and Hell</b> - Battle against all who stand in your way&mdash;from war-weary angelic forces to hell\'s hideous demon hordes.</li> <li><b>Weapons and Gear</b> - <i>Darksiders</i> features an extensive arsenal and inventory of weapons and gear.</li> <li><b>Varied Play Environments</b> - Players will fight through varied environments, including those above and underground, and modern and nightmarishly mythical in design.</li> <li><b>PlayStation Network</b> - Although a single player game, <i>Darksiders</i> features PlayStation Network Trophy support and other features to heighten the gameplay experience.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

As a band, the six members often play their special parts at the same time, though each player can jam however and whenever he or she wants. Play all at once. Take turns in the spotlight. Pair up in creative ways throughout the song. You can bring the band to life by yourself, playing one part at a time-or with up to four players. See game mode below: <ul> <li><b>Solo Play</b>: When you play by yourself, you can add one part at a time to arrange the whole song exactly how you want. The Tutes are on hand to back up your band in any parts you need filled.</li> <li><b>Multiplayer</b>: When in a band with friends, up to four people can be band members.</li> <li><b>Wii Friends</b>: Using WiiConnect24, you can send your jam videos to Wii Friends who own Wii Music. They can then watch your performance, modify it to their liking and send their jam videos back to you.</li> </ul> <b>Tutes: Your Own Private Back-up Band</b><br/> When not playing with friends, you can invite jam masters known as Tutes to play with you. They\'ll join a session playing an instrument that each thinks is strong for a specific song. You can simply enjoy the musical camaraderie, or pick up instrument tips by watching them jam. If you choose to watch, the Tutes will show you lots of techniques for many of these instruments, then ask you to follow their examples. They\'ll start with the simplest techniques, then as you master each one, show you even more nuanced ones.<p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>:<br/> <ul> <li><b>Easy to Play Improv Jams</b> - All members of your band jam by simply playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heart\'s content. Play faster. Play slower. Skip a beat, or throw in 10 more. <i>Wii Music</i> challenges you to transform your improv stylings into great music. There are no mistakes and no game scores-just playing for the pure joy of playing.</li> <li><b>Wii Controls Immerse You in the Music</b> - You can play most of the 60-plus instruments in <i>Wii Music</i> using simple motions with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers. Strum to play guitar, banjo and sitar. Drum to play jazz drums, congas and snare drums. Hammer away to play piano, vibraphone and marimba. Unlike most music games, <i>Wii Music</i> doesn\'t make you use many complex buttons. You only need to imitate playing the instrument.</li> <li><b>Virtually Endless Ways to Make Music</b> - You choose the song and instruments and decide whether to blaze through a rock take on classical songs, put a jazzy spin on folk tunes or transform Nintendo classics like the <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> theme into Latin-flavored numbers. The song list is only a takeoff point-it\'s how you improvise with the songs that matters.</li> <li><b>Share Your Band Jams With Friends</b> - They\'ll see your Mii band members, your players\' improv styles and your instrument selections. They can watch your recordings, or play over parts of your song, then send their modified recording back to you. So you can send improv jams back and forth over WiiConnect24, changing them again and again.</li> </ul> <b>60+ Instruments</b><br/> You can play most of the 60-plus instruments in <i>Wii Music</i> using simple motions with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers. Strum to play guitar, banjo and sitar. Drum to play jazz drums, congas and marching drums. Hammer away to play piano, vibraphone and marimba. Unlike most music games, Wii Music doesn\'t make you use complex buttons. You only need to imitate playing the instrument. <i>Wii Music</i> offers virtually endless ways to make music.<p/> <b>Fun Beyond the Jam</b><br/> Designed with classic Wii gameplay in mind, <i>Wii Music</i> includes many other modes and play options besides the main band jams, including several musical games and an enhanced video playback mode for recorded jams. <ul> <li><b>Videos Mode</b>: Watch your jam videos in an enhanced playback mode that brings your jams to life with fun environmental effects and dramatic camera angles.</li> <li><b>Mii Maestro</b>: By waving the Wii Remote like a conductor\'s baton in this mini-game, you\'ll lead a Mii orchestra through orchestrated songs, such as The <i>Legend of Zelda</i> theme. Make them play quickly, slowly, strongly or gently-the orchestra is at your command.</li> <li><b>Handbell Harmony</b>: In this musical mini-game, you\'ll play in a handbell ensemble by swinging your Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Everyone on the team has a job to do: play one of your notes only when the tune demands it.</li> <li><b>Pitch Perfect</b>: How good is your musical ear? In this whimsical musical quiz, you\'ll have to solve challenges, like putting note-playing Miis in order from lowest to highest pitch.</li> <li><b>Drum Mode</b>: In the one mode that uses the Wii Balance Board accessory (sold with <i>Wii Fit</i>), you can feel what it\'s like to play a real-life drum set. You\'ll use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk as drumsticks, and place both feet on the Wii Balance Board-which work as virtual pedals for the bass drum and hi-hat cymbal.</li> </ul> <p/>']","by

The game lets you customize the player down to the smallest detail, including his free kick run-up and celebration routine. If you use a supported camera, you can even put your face on the player and create team emblems. After you've created your character, the more you practice and play, the more he improves."", ""After you have a legend you're satisfied with, you can export him to an online legends game with four other players, where you team up and play against computer teams."", '<b>Realistic Ball Movement</b><br> Balls now move around more realistically thanks to adjustments for friction, air resistance, backspin, and more. This allows for new strategies and techniques such as lifting balls over defenders legs and doing tee shots. Improvements have also been made in passing, and the reactions of your teammates. The upshot is a game that looks and plays more like real life.', ""<b>Play With and Against Friends Online</b><br> In addition to the Legend online mode, you can also challenge your friend to a 1-on-1 match. If your friends aren't online, there is also a quickmatch option that pairs you to a random online player."", 'With its exclusive UEFA Champions League license and updated ball movement and graphics, Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 will have soccer fans cheering.']","by

In Chrono Trigger prepare yourself to journey into the forgotten past, distant future, and even to the very End of Time.', ""<b>The Worlds of Past, Present and Future</b><br> In Chrono Trigger you'll journey back to Prehistory (65,000,000 B.C.) where humans and reptiles battle to wipe each other from existence. Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land."", ""The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world. After the day of the apocalypse in 1999 A.D., the prosperous civilization of humanity crumbled and the remaining people struggle to stay alive. And, finally, there remains the End of Time -- a place with no era to call its own. This confluence of time's streams transcends spatiotemporal boundaries. It is here at the gravitational center for all temporal flotsam that Spekkio -- the Master of War -- serves as your guide on time's treacherous roads."", '<b>Battle Systems and gameplay</b><br> This game utilizes a revised version of the groundbreaking Active Time Battle (ATB) System. Chrono Trigger features exhilarating combat in which the clock is constantly ticking. Characters must first wait as the ATB gauges charge, and then perform an action. This makes strategic timing a crucial element in your battle plan. In addition to standard attacks, each character has an array of special Tech skills and powerful combos known as Dual and Triple Techs. Cooperate with other characters to unleash over 50 unique and devastating moves!', 'Chrono Trigger utilizes great story-telling, interesting characters, action-packed gameplay, and the unique controls of the Nintendo DS to deliver a fun and well-rounded role-playing game on a portable platform. <br clear=""all"">']","by

Focused on historically based, intense, small-scale WWII combat rather than the mega battles set in sci-fi or fantasy game worlds that are common to most RTS games, this allows players to experience both the fruits and follies of their battlefield decisions on an intimate level as they truly become part of the story. This approach to storytelling is taken even further in three separate single player campaigns built into <i>Tales of Valor</i>. Set during the historical battles following the Allied invasion of Europe on D-Day, these three -- Tiger Ace, Causeway and Falaise Pocket -- illustrate the struggles of both individual German and Allied squads from both the perspective of tank commanders and crew and field soldiers. Each campaign contains three missions, allowing players to immerse themselves in the gameplay and get to know their squadmates. <p/> <b>New Multiplayer Vehicles and Modes</b><br/> In addition to its single player campaigns, <i>Company of Heroes</i> also features significant new multiplayer functionality. The first example of this are the variety of vehicles that players will have access to in multiplayer modes. These include, but are not limited to, the \'Schwimmwagon\' an German amphibious vehicle used for reconnaissance missions and enemy troop harassment; the Hellcat, a sturdy Allied plane valuable in battling tanks from above; and the Kangaroo, a heavily armored, British troop carrier. The game also contains three new multiplayer modes which utilize both Allied and Axis forces. \'Stonewall\' mode is a co-op mode where players work together to fend off invasion as they struggle to keep a town from falling under enemy control. \'Assault\' mode challenges players to push the limits of the front line as they choose a unit, battle opposing enemy units and attempt to destroy the opposition\'s headquarters. And finally, \'Panzerkrieg\' is an all out arcade style tank battle where every unit is out for itself. <p/> <b>Direct Fire Control</b><br/> As an extension of <i>Company of Heroes\'</i> focus on small-scale, but intense combat, <i>Tales of Valor</i> features a new optional targeting system known as \'Direct Fire.\' Through this players can target exact spots on tanks or other vehicles, specific areas of the battlefield or even individual soldiers within a unit. This ultra specific targeting system allows players to get even closer to the action than in previous games, yet is toggle based, making it is easy for players to return to standard firing as you choose. \'Direct Fire\' is available in all single player campaigns, as well as the \'Panzerkrieg\' multiplayer mode. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>3 Immersive Storylines</b> - Take command of key soldiers and experience how they helped turn the tide of battle in some of the most historic clashes of World War II.</li> <ul> <li>Episode 1: Tiger Ace - Control Tiger Tank Ace Hauptmann Voss&rsquo;s highly decorated Tigergruppen against the British 7th Armored Division on D-Day in one of the most famous tank battles of WWII.</li> <li>Episode 2: Causeway - Command an American Paratrooper Company in the hours following the initial D-day landings.</li> <li>Episode 2: Falaise Pocket - Command the Wehrmacht Army as your soldiers try and hold off the advancing Allied army.</li> </ul> <li><b>Direct Fire Control</b> - Not only can the player&rsquo;s tactical and strategic decisions influence the battle, but players also directly control units on the battlefield.

The Schwimmwagen is an amphibious, all-wheel drive off-road vehicle while the Hellcat, a sturdy Allied plane is valuable in battling tanks from above.</li> <li><b>Conquer New Territory</b> - New maps based on famous battles such as Villers-Bocage will be available for competitive players in the online battlefield.</li> <li><b>3 New Multiplayer Modes</b> - New multiplayer modes to experience with your friends.

That's because it was built by the engineers at Alesis, one of the largest manufacturers of professional electronic drums in the world. As a result, you get a kit that's designed to take a real beating, with all the positioning flexibility that professional drummers demand. While other drum controllers lock you down to a pre-molded plastic array of pads, Drum Rocker's professional aluminum drum rack lets you position your snare, tom and cymbal pads wherever you want. When you're ready to move from playing Rock Band to playing in a rock band, you can swap the game controller module with one of the professional drum brains made by Alesis, and you're ready to hit the road for real!  Drum Rocker's velocity-sensitive drum pads feature a playing surface that is much quieter than other drum controllers. They also feel great &#8211; the stick rebound off of the pad is much more natural and consistent than anything else available. The pad housing is made of high-impact plastic, designed to be whacked on stage night after night. No matter how much you punish them, the Drum Rocker drum pads can take it.  Complete the experience with up to three cymbals.   There's nothing like finishing a monster fill by whacking a crash cymbal. Or crossing over to play your hi-hat with your right hand while you keep the backbeat on the snare with your left. Or keeping time on a ride cymbal during the chorus. Drum Rocker lets you do all that and more, with cymbals that can be placed anywhere around the kit.

Nina Kalenkow&rsquo;s world is turned upside down when she learns that her father, the scientist Vladimir Kalenkow, has vanished without a trace. Since the police can&rsquo;t (or won&rsquo;t?) help, Nina decides to search for clues to her father&rsquo;s whereabouts on her own. On the way, she meets Max Gruber, one of her father&rsquo;s colleagues, who spontaneously offers the attractive young woman his help. <p/> The trail leads Nina and Max to a mysterious disaster in the Tunguska region of Siberia in 1908, which Vladimir Kalenkow had been investigating. Does the disappearance of Nina&rsquo;s father have something to do with his previous expeditions to Siberia? The search for an answer leads the two heroes from Berlin, around the globe and to the Antarctic, and it soon becomes clear that there are others who are also interested in Nina&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s secrets.

As the game begins Batman is personally delivering his nemesis, The Joker, to the asylum at Arkham Island, but he is uneasy. Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker\'s intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker\'s intricate plot? <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br> In <i>Batman: Arkham Asylum</i> players strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don\'t expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman\'s skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker\'s underlying scheme is. <p/> In addition to the story-driven single player campaign <i>Arkham Asylum</i> also contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman\'s physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as \'Invisible Predator\' utilizes the Dark Knight\'s skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li>Utilize the unique FreeFlow combat system to chain together unlimited combos seamlessly and battle with huge groups of The Joker\'s henchmen in brutal melee brawls.</li> <li>Investigate as Batman, the world\'s greatest detective, by solving intricate puzzles with the help of cutting edge forensic tools including x-ray scanning, fingerprint scans, \'Amido Black\' spray and a pheromone tracker.</li> <li>Face off against Gotham\'s greatest villains including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc.</li> <li>Become the Invisible Predator with Batman\'s fear takedowns and unique vantage point system to move without being seen and hunt enemies.</li> <li>Choose multiple takedown methods, including swooping from the sky and smashing through walls, and use the predator camera get a closer look at the action.</li> <li>Explore every inch of Arkham Asylum and roam freely on the infamous island, presented for the first time ever in its gritty and realistic entirety.</li> <li>Experience what it\'s like to be Batman using batarangs, explosive gel aerosol, the Batclaw, sonar resonator and the line launcher.</li> <li>Unlock more secrets by completing hidden challenges in the world and develop and customize equipment by earning experience points.</li> <li>Enjoy complete superhero freedom in the environment with the use of Batman\'s grapple to get to any place you can see, jump from any height and glide in any direction.</li> <li>PlayStation 3 exclusive Joker Challenge Map DLC.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

The advanced physics of previous Peggle games is now at work in this DS edition, which means the trajectory of each bouncing ball is calculated in real time, and the results of a shot may change if your aim is off by even one pixel. The precision of your angles also means that there\'s quite a bit of math-practice hidden in what seems like a purely entertaining game. Watching what happens after you let the ball go is a big part of the fun, since even the most skilled players are sure to get a few tantalizing, unlikely bounces each round.', ""<b>All-New Underground Challenges</b><br> One place fans of the PC-based Peggles won't have a leg up is facing the parts of this game that are set in the Bonus Underground -- an exclusive, DS-specific addition to the Peggle universe.

Portrait of a Thief</i> consists of a series of timed chapters linked to the mystery of who raided the art collection of your client, Kensington Billingsley. The goal in each chapter is to find a set list of items and answers hidden throughout the urban landscape of the gameplay area and solve any additional puzzles that are presented to you along the way before your allotted 30 minutes runs out. Each list consists of ten items, which are displayed on the DS\' top screen and are ticked off the list as you find them. The actual puzzle-solving happens on the lower touchscreen of the DS/DSi, where players can use either the DS stylus or button combinations to identify hidden items and answers. Along with seek and find puzzles, where players have to find specific objects hidden in a larger jumble of items, the game also features word puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, pair matching challenges and more. Players start the game as a rank amateur sleuth, but with success rise in status and gain points. Along with the challenge of seeing how many can be accumulated, points are also valuable in that they can be used to buy hints when/if players get stuck. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Find over 1,600 objects in 70 seek-and-solve puzzles within 18 locations.</li> <li>Test your skills in 4 stylus-based mini-games, with high-score leaderboards.</li> <li>Keep track of suspects and clues in your case log.</li> <li>Collect bonus objects and unlock two modes of unlimited play.</li> <li>Enjoy a rich character-driven story written exclusively for Nintendo DS.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Additional Screenshots</b>:<br/> <table cellspacing=""0"" align=""center""> <tr> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001EQPDO2.05.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=404\'); return false;""><img alt=""Seek and find puzzle screen from Mystery P.I.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.', ""<b>The Return of the Chimera</b><br> The Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements."", 'Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.', ""<b>The Battle Moves to the United States</b><br> After the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies demolishing the city with fiery beams. Burned and mangled, it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies."", ""In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save mankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience."", ""<b>Online game play Goes BIG</b><br> Powered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest.

As such, the player assumes the role of ""the planet"" that is capable of tilting back and forth, and bouncing the LocoRoco in the air, to defeat the Moja Troop and rescue the LocoRoco. The player will also meet many different characters along the way, some of which are unknown to the player. The player must find out how to interact with these characters, and find out what they know, while determining if they are beneficial or should be avoided as foes. Mui Mui can be found in secret areas within the game. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li>25 colorful new stages with hidden challenges to uncover</li> <li>Enhance LocoRoco by collecting music notes</li> <li>Play 6 exciting new mini games</li> <li>Challenge friends Ad-hoc 4 player battle</li> <li>New LocoRoco Actions: Climb into shells to roll and destroy obstacles, Swing on vines and Jump across grass blades, Sing together and collect notes, Swim underwater</li> </ul> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> The player controls the planet the LocoRoco inhabit to move the LocoRoco around. The player can also split larger LocoRoco into individual LocoRoco, and then recombine them. Splitting is required into order to fit through tight spaces and also solve many puzzles. (For example, smaller LocoRoco start singing when left idle for a while, which is required at the end of the levels.) There are 5 worlds to clear, each consisting of 8 levels.<br><br> The object of each level is to find and eat as many ""berries"" as possible to increase the size of the LocoRoco, to a maximum of 20. There are also ""Pickories"" and ""Mui Mui"" to find. The ""Pickories"" are used as currency for playing the minigames Mui Mui Crane and Chuppa Chuppa, while the ""Mui Mui"" unlock more minigames and music for the Loco House. The player must also be careful to avoid enemies, mainly ""Burrs"" (spiky obstacles) and ""Moja"", which can cause them to lose LocoRoco or even die if the last LocoRoco is lost.']","by

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You\'ll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that\'s just the beginning.', ""<strong>UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary Conflict</strong><br /> The story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above. And with this collector's edition, you also get access to the Honor Guard Wraith, a truly unique in-game vehicle with awesome capabilities."", ""<strong>Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy Faction</strong><br /> That's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?"", ""<strong>Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360</strong><br /> Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, but <em>Halo Wars</em> has been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller."", '<table align=""left"" cellpadding=""15"" cellspacing=""15"" width=""250""> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align=""top"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001F6KSDM-5-sm.jpg"" /><br /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.', ""In addition to including the standard retail version of <em>Halo Wars</em> , this Collector's Edition includes:"", '']","by

The Rabbids have taken over almost every channel you can imagine, from music to movies, from wrestling to reality TV - even TV ads. In Story Mode, players play through a week of television, with each day bringing new wacky challenges of skill and insane movements in a compilation of mini-games. With up to eight players in turn-based mode and four players simultaneously, get ready for some serious insanity as you and all your friends help the Rabbids destroy all our daily viewing and drive Rayman crazy in the process.<p/> <b>Put Your Wii Balance Board to Use</b><br/> Although 100% playable with just the Wii Remote and Nunchuck control configuration, <i>Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party</i> is optimized in part to be used with the Wii Balance Board as well. In fact, nearly 40% of the game\'s 65+ mini-games incorporate support for the Wii Balance Board, with the majority of these when played at harder difficulty values, incorporating all three controllers simultaneously. Use of the Wii Balance Board in-game is turn-based, but this fun, new application for Nintendo\'s new peripheral for the Wii ensures that all your <i>TV Party</i>\'s will be a full body experience. <p/> Just a few of the mini-games in <i>Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party</i> that take advantage of the Wii Balance Board are: \'Beestie Boarding\', a wild winter ride down obstacle filled slopes astride an inverted wildebeest, and \'Garden of Weeden\', where you use the Balance Board to pour weed killer on overgrown vegetation. Both utilize pressure applied to the Balance Board\'s four main directions for the desired effect. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Unique Use of the Wii Balance Board</b> - Play loads of exciting new games with the new Wii Balance Board and experience the first game in the world that you can play with your rear end.</li> <li><b>New Wacky Games</b> - Play 65+ brand-new mini and not so mini-games that spoof popular culture, from TV series to TV classics, not to mention a whole lot of insane ads thrown in for good mention.</li> <li><b>All-New Party Mode</b> - Play co-op or battle your friends simultaneously with up to four players, or go crazy with up to eight players in party mode. You can even sabotage your friends while they are playing.</li> <li><b>Unique Use of the Wii Remote</b> - Discover new and innovative ways to play with eight types of gameplay, including shaking, precision, dexterity and balance.</li> <li><b>Shake that Rabbid</b> - Use the Wii Remote and Wii Balance Board to dance and wiggle your booty.</li> <li><b>Customize your bunny</b> - Pimp your bunny out, take his photo and send it to your friends online.</li> </ul> <b>Double Your Fun in Party Mode</b><br/> Like many Wii games with a heavy mini-game component, <i>Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party</i> comes with built-in four player multiplayer support, but <i>TV Party</i> takes this common feature a few steps further. In addition to a full simultaneous four-player co-op and battle mode it also features an all-new, powerfully fun, party mode. Capable of supporting up to eight players in local play through a turn-based system and allowing for players with remotes, waiting their turn on the sidelines to interfere in the progress of the current player, it opens a whole new layer of chaos to the already chaotic world of <i>Rayman Raving Rabbids</i>. <p/>']","by

The two new buttons turn rapid fire on/off for the RT and LT (AKA the normal triggers become rapid fire). For example, press the new right button once, and rapid fire turns on the right trigger. Press and hold the right button for 3 seconds, and mode 2 will be activated (indicated by the LEDs blinking 2 times). Press and hold for 3 more seconds and mode 3 will be activated (indicated by the LEDs blinking 3 times). Do it again to return to mode 1. We only use the highest quality parts, brand new controllers, and the most advanced coding on the microchip. Our controllers come with a 30 day warranty on the modification. If anything ever goes wrong out of warranty, just pay for shipping and we will repair it for free. However, we have made hundreds of these controllers and have never had to repair a single one. Be careful when ordering from elsewhere, not all chips and mods are created equal. Many modifiers use cheap chips and parts that do not last more than a few months, whereas ours will last for years and years. Don't waste your money on the cheaper versions of this mod that will not last. Remember, no one else offers the same warranty and free repair service. To summarize: Coolest modification available, highest quality parts, advanced chip coding, long lasting, free service and repair, great customer service, fast shipping, and above all: true customer satisfaction.

Instead of the skaters\' paradise that the city used to be, the new city dubbed New San Vanelona, has stepped-up security, thanks to Mongo Co., in order to protect the best parts of the city. This is the setting for you to rebuild your skate career and revive the city\'s skate scene.', ""Whereas you started the last game by learning the basics of skating, with Skate 2 you'll be immediately challenged by find a couple huge ramps. You start out at Slappy's, and while there are some tutorials, veterans will be able to blaze through them in about a minute. New players, on the other hand, will find Slappy's park to be inviting and easily accessible, and can get a taste of what's in store for them before taking on the entirety of San Vanelona. And once out there, you'll find that people you run into remember you and what you did five years ago, and are excited to see you back in action."", '<b>Exciting New Features and Capabilities</b><br> While the controls will be instantly familiar to fans of the previous game, there are loads of new tricks to perform. Skaters can now do footplants, crail slides and fingerflips. Or show off with a lip trick, an Ollie North, and the long-sought ability to Skitch (grabbing the bumper of a moving car) to gain speed.', ""New to Skate 2 is the ability to get off your board and walk around. While on foot, players can move certain objects in the world, creating their own lines with nearly 100 different objects. Changes to the environment, big or small, will stay put in the game regardless of how long you play. Should you decide that you no longer like your giant stack of trash bins or some other madness you've set up, one touch of a button can return the items to their original position. This means gamers can create their own epic spots and challenges, which can then be uploaded, shared, and experienced by others around the world."", ""<b>Loads of Great Improvements</b><br> Skate 2 expands on the original's popular Reel editor, allowing gamers to place a follow camera or a fixed tripod camera wherever they want, recording their wicked tricks and brutal crashes. And speaking of crashes, skaters will now experience, and be able to highlight, damage to their threads. Clothes get dirty and become torn, and players get cuts and bruises depending on their actions. And if you crash big enough, you'll see a bail score pop up and increase as you take damage, culminating in the Thrasher Hall of Meat screen that tells you how well you've done crashing, and gives you an x-ray view showing your broken bones."", 'Skate 2 also features the choice of creating either a male or female character, rather than just male, and will offer an in-depth graphics creator. The role of money increases, allowing players to buy up pieces of property and turn them into a full-fledged skate parks. And there is a great new Goofy vs. Regular competition variant, where two teams of three skaters compete in the same park at the same time. <P> In short, Skate 2 ups the ante in delivering all the grit, creativity and culture of skateboarding, with all-new tricks and capabilities that allow players to truly skate it their way, on and off the board. <br clear=""all""> <center> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page//B001FZ13AU-5-lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=860,height=500\'); return false;""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page//B001FZ13AU-5-sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top></a> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page//B001FZ13AU-6-lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=860,height=500\'); return false;""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page//B001FZ13AU-6-sm.jpg"" border=0></a><br><br> <span class=""caption"">The create-a-skater features lets you personalize your player. </class> </center> <br clear=""all"">']","by

Almost more strange than the man at the crossroads, a mysterious girl, Namine, draws pictures inside Castle Oblivion under close surveillance of an evil organization.
