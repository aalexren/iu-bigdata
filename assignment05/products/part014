In addition, for the first time in the Transformers universe, players can also fight the epic war between Autobots and Decepticons in explosive co-op action. <p/> <b>The Story</b><br/> Set a few years after the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, <i>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</i> reveals that the threat from the Decepticons is in fact, far from ended. Since the time of the epic and apparently not so final battle between the two Transformer leaders, Decepticons have started popping up again all over Earth in alarming numbers. And now, a mysterious object from space seems destined to shift the balance of power and give the upper hand to the Decepticons. <p/> <b>Mission-centric Gameplay</b><br/> Unlike Activision\'s <i>Transformers: The Game</i>, released along side the original movie back in 2007, <i>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</i> relies less on open-world gameplay and more on structured, but varied mission play. The variety in these missions comes from the fact that players can align themselves with either the Autobots or Decepticons, and that the available missions both parallel the events of the movie, as well as events unique to the game. During these missions players will be able to play as a variety of different Transformers from either side of the conflict, and with success in mission play will be able to unlock additional Transformers and earn points used to upgrade your selected faction. Playable characters include on the Autobot side: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Breakaway, Bumblebee, and Ratchet; and from the Decepticon side: Starscream, Sideways (a new character), Grindor, Long Haul, and Megatron. The game features a simple control toggle that not only allows for quick switching between mech, vehicle and weapon forms, but also allows for a more easy learning curve of the acrobatic moves from the movie. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>The Choice is Yours</b> &ndash; Players can step into the shoes of their favorite Autobots and Decepticons such as Optimus Prime, Starscream, Bumblebee and Ironhide, along with new characters making their first appearance in a game. With two distinct campaigns that allow gamers to save or destroy the human race, gamers will unlock missions and be able to play them in any order they desire and with different characters for a whole new experience.</li> <li><b>Outmaneuver Your Opponents</b> &ndash; Instantaneously convert from a colossal robot to a dynamic land or air vehicle such as a diesel truck, sports car, military chopper or fighter jet. New, ultra-fluid transformations can be performed in-motion anytime and anywhere, allowing players to strategically propel through and decimate hordes of enemies with incredible agility.</li> <li><b>Battle with Friends in Co-op Play</b> &ndash; All new offline co-op gameplay lets you team up with a friend.</li> <li><b>Demolish Your Enemies</b> &ndash; Each Transformer can unleash a unique array of assaults on its enemies ranging from powerful missile attacks and rapid-fire chain guns to explosive energy blasts and visceral melee strikes, allowing players to pick from a variety of weapons and moves in their character\'s arsenal that deliver diverse gameplay in every brutal encounter.</li> <li><b>Intense, Heroic Missions</b> &ndash; Every second is precious as players drive, fly, fight and blast their way through gripping, pulse-pounding levels straight from the film and beyond to determine the ultimate fate of the world.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

It is an event which role players have been eagerly awaiting ever since the <i>Nordland Trilogy</i>. The story centers around Ferdok, an important trading city on the Great River. The feared female lancers of Ferdok and Ferdok\'s famous beer have given the city a reputation throughout the continent and the humans here live in harmony with the dwarves. But despite the cheerful and peaceful atmosphere, the peace is now being shaken by a mysterious series of murders. Sinister figures are pursuing their dark schemes, while the fear among the population grows with every new murder. And while the adventures are still pondering whether the crimes are connected to the proclamation made by the Church of Hesinde on the tenth anniversary of the Dragonquest, they themselves are dragged into the mysterious events by a very particular murder. <p/> <b>Character Creation</b><br /> <i>The Dark Eye: Drakensang</i> provides a choice of 10 archetypes for creating characters. These are pre-generated gaming figures that already have a background story and for which all basic properties, talents and abilities are predefined. This is particularly helpful to newcomers, who are not familiar with <i>Dark Eye</i> rules, giving them an easy entry into the game. Within these, areas of specialization (e.g. warrior magician - specialization: charlatan) open up a huge range of possibilities for choosing a personal gaming character and then entering the great adventure. In addition, there is an expert mode available to experienced players. In this area of character generation, all properties of your hero can be altered individually and adjusted even more precisely to fit your personal gaming style. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li>Rich story penned by the authors of the original franchise books and adventures and based in Germany`s #1 pen &amp; paper RPG system <i>The Dark Eye</i>.</li> <li>Huge, detailed medieval 3D world with authentic looks of historic European architecture.</li> <li>Versatile, round-based combat system that brings tactics back to combat.</li> <li>Talent-based dialogue system.</li> <li>Quest in groups of up to four adventurers.</li> <li>More than 40 spells, with over 30 talents and almost 40 special abilities allow a large range of possibilities for character creation.</li> <li>Individual party skill development.</li> <li>Numerous and varied enemies and monsters from the DSA universe, such as linnorms, ogres, undead mules, giant amoeba and many more.</li> <li>Rule-compliant implementation of the DSA license in the tradition of the <i>Nordland Trilogy</i>.</li> </ul> <h4>System Requirements:</h4><center><table border=1 cellpadding=""3"" width=50%><tr><td></td><td colspan=""2"" align=center><b>Recommended Specifications:</b></td><tr><td>OS:</td><td colspan=2 align=center>Windows Vista/Window XP with SP2</td></tr><tr><td>Processor:</td><td colspan=""2"" align=center>Intel Core 2 Duo E8200 with 2.6 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 5200+</td></tr><tr><td>RAM:</td><td colspan=""2"" align=center>2.5MB RAM for Vista, 2MB RAM for XP</td></tr><tr><td>Video:</td><td colspan=""2"" align=center>NVIDIA GeForce 8600 or ATI Radeon X 1900 with 512 MB RAM</td></tr><tr><td>Sound:</td><td colspan=""2"" align=center>DirectX 9.0c compatible</td></tr><tr><td>DVD-ROM:</td><td colspan=2 align=center>4x DVD-ROM drive or faster</td></tr><tr><td>Hard Drive Space:</td><td colspan=2 align=center>6GB of Free Space</td></tr><tr><td>Other:</td><td colspan=2 align=center>Internet connection required for online play</td></tr></table></center> <br /><br /><br /><br />']","by

Join Haken Browning: gunslinger, professional bounty hunter, and amateur ladies\' man, along with his motley crew of robots, were-beasts, secret agents, and busty princesses as they delve deep into the mysteries of how their worlds came to be and face a threat that imperils the multiverse.<p/> <b>Battle</b><br> While engaged in combat in <i>Endless Frontier</i> players utilize every character available, but only four characters will be acting as front-line fighters. Use the formation option to rearrange your party, where characters in the front will be the ones getting up-close and personal with enemies, and characters in the back will be available to provide support for attacks. During a battle each character will make use of HP, SP and COM. HP is the character\'s health. When it is down to zero the character is knocked out and can\'t be used in battle until revived. If all four characters in front are knocked out, you\'ve lost the battle and the game is over. SP is used for skills and spirit commands. These provide a variety of useful effects like healing or special attacks that deal status effects to enemies. COM is what allows you to perform attacks each turn. Each attack a character makes has an associated COM cost. More damaging attacks require more COM and if a character doesn\'t have enough COM to continue her/his attack sequence, the turn ends. Each character regains some COM every turn, and some items or spirit commands will refresh a character\'s COM as well. <p/> <b>Hit Count and Combos</b><br> Every time you strike an enemy, that enemy will be lifted off the ground slightly. As long as the enemy is in the air each successive hit will add to the hit count. The higher the hit count, the more damage you\'ll do in a series of attacks. In addition, your chance of getting critical hits increases in direct proportion to the current length of the combo. Critical hits deal a lot of damage. To keep your hit count high, use careful timing to chain your characters\' attacks together into an unstoppable tidal wave of pain. These tricks will keep you fighting at the top of your game. <p/> <b>Chain Attacks</b><br> While one of your characters is attacking, if the next characters to attack is another one of your characters, you can begin the second character\'s turn before the first has completely finished his attacks. This might seem wasteful, but it lets the second character jump right into combat and begin attacking while the enemy is still being juggled from the attacks of the first character, further increasing the hit count and dealing more damage through critical hits. You\'ll also get a boost to the frontier gauge, making it even easier to use overdrive attack more often. <p/> <b>Support Attacks</b><br/> Characters in the back row can still help you out, even if they\'re not part of the fighting force. Call upon those members of the party to use support attacks, during which they will quickly jump into battle, deal a few hits, then leap away again. This takes place while your party members are attacking, so you can continue attacking on your own. Let the assisting characters attack, or use this opportunity to chain in more characters to extend the combo even further. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Fighting style combat</b> - Combo attack your enemies and never let them hit the ground to deal the most damage. This unique &ldquo;juggling&rdquo; gameplay and timing-based attacks keep every encounter fresh and exciting, unlike most RPGs.</li> <li><b>Story intended for mature RPG gamers</b> - Intended for the more seasoned, older gamers, the story includes more nuanced, complex characters and manages to mix drama, romance, and humor to great effect..</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

These signature weapons are one way that <i>XXX Accent Core Plus</i> stands out from other games in the 2D fighter genre. Although players will see a bevy of familiar blunt and bladed weapons, they will notice that many characters wield off-the-wall items that have to be seen in action to be believed. Just a few examples of these are a pool cue, a talking life-sized key and an extendable pink teddy bear. <p/> <b>Special Attacks and Defenses</b><br/> Although true to the aggressive-oriented gameplay that has made the <i>Guilty Gear</i> series a player favorite for ten years, <i>XX Accent Core Plus</i> strikes a balance between offense and defense through ""force break"" attacks and ""slash backs."" Force break attacks are powered-up versions of characters\' special techniques used to enhance individual offense strikes as well as combination attacks. On the defensive end, players can turn defensive tactics offensive with the ""slash back,"" which with a little practice allows characters to consistently come out of a defensive animation quickly, giving you an opportunity to more safely counterattack from a defensive position. <p/> <b>Characters</b><br/> Just in time to take advantage of high resolution 480p graphics, <i>Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus</i> features the return of over 25 beloved characters from the <i>Guilty Gear</i> franchise, including Kliff, Justice and many more.

This brought about the creation of Roxas, Sora&rsquo;s ""Nobody."" Yet Roxas has no recollection of his previous life, which is unusual for a Nobody. He joins Organization XIII and slowly begins to discover the truth behind his existence and the Organization itself. As time passes he meets and befriends the fourteenth member of the Organization, who also has no recollection of her past. It is a strange coincidence. What will Roxas see during his time in the Organization? What is the connection between him, Sora, and the fourteenth member? And what becomes of them? Dive into the heart of the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> storyline&rsquo;s biggest secrets. <p/> <b>Panel System</b><br/> <i>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</i> contains a new gameplay mechanic referred to as the ""Panel System."" These panels serve as a means to equip and customize character\'s levels, items, magic, weapons, abilities, armor and accessories. But more than just a means of access, panels also facilitate progression through the game in that certain items, spells, etc. necessary for progression cannot be used, or at least used to their full potential, until their panels are equipped. Once done though, not only can these be used, in many cases through the use of ""Link Panels"", which can be used in conjunction with other panels, thus allowing for special item and ability creation. <p/> <b>Multiplayer</b><br/> Not only does <i>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</i> allow for team-based gameplay utilizing the franchises standard AI partners functionality, it also contains exciting cooperative and competitive multiplayer options. In both these options players can join together with additional players in DS multi-card play over a DS Wi-Fi connection. The cooperative mode is the real showcase option though, allowing players to team up with up to three friends and engage in mission play that is distinct from the story driven mode of the single player campaign. During these battles players choose from one of the fourteen members of Organization XIII, each wielding different weapons, skills, and stats. The multiplayer campaign also features hidden characters including favorite characters from the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> and Disney universe including Sora, Donald, Goofy, King Mickey and Riku. <p/> In addition, although dialog between characters and player in <i>Kingdom Hearts 358/2</i> is limited to text, within multiplayer modes players will have access to a chat system for communication which displays responses on a single screen, allowing for complete exchanges and conversations between players in context. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li>Familiar action-packed <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> gameplay that has captivated fans worldwide.</li> <li>The brand new ""Panel System"" that allows you to customize Roxas&rsquo; arsenal by placing abilities, items, and weapon parts into allotted slots.</li> <li>Learn about the origins of the ""Organization XIII"" name.</li> <li>A series-first multiplayer mode, allowing up to 4 players to control any Organization XIII member.</li> <li>Additional unlockable characters in multiplayer modes, including: Sora, Donald, Goofy, King Mickey and Riku.</li> <li>Get to know the members of Organization XIII, including the mysterious fourteenth member.</li> <li>Finally experience the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> storyline&rsquo;s missing chapter.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Working what seems to be a routine mission in Shanghai they find themselves surrounded by a force of competing private military contractors intent on running amok in the city.

All they have is each other to rely on. <br><br>As with the original Army of Two, and as the name of the series implies, game play in Army of Two: The 40th Day revolves around co-op combat tactics necessary to survive specific and general combat situations.

Unlike the original game, which in some instances limited the use of some tactics to certain situations, in The 40th Day, you have access to all tactics. Implementing these against opponents revolves around the game\'s ""Aggro"" system, tallied in the heads-up-display (HUD) and which measures the amount of attention a team member draws from opponents for certain tactics, leaving the other team member in various states of freedom to launch coordinated attacks as chosen. In addition to this change, you are also faced with moral dilemmas in the game, including choices presented to one of the players on a team that the other must bear the consequences of, as well as the decision as to deal with and/or defend civilian non-player characters (NPCs), who can be killed in the game.']","by

For example: have you ever wished that you could play poker while racing? Think you can toss a dart or roll a bowling ball while leaving the competition in the dust? <i>ExciteBots</i> provides you with your chance. Stars can be traded for a variety of goodies, like new vehicles, tracks, icons and statues. <p/> <b>Control Schemes</b><br/> The control scheme of <i>ExciteBots</i> is easy and fun. The game can be played with just a Wii Remote or via the combination of a Wii Remote and a Nintendo Wheel accessory/any third party wheel. The 2 Button on the Wii Remote controller is the gas. The + control pad gives drivers a speed boost. Players turn the Wii Wheel accessory left or right to steer, tilt the Wii Wheel in midair to glide or to adjust pitch for perfect landings, swing the Wii Wheel in circular motions around boost bars to build up speed and press the A Button to activate items or to cash in hands in Poker Mode. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li>The game takes the big-air thrills and simple pick-up-and-play controls of <i>ExciteTruck</i> and ramps up the fun with a constant barrage of funky challenges and mini-games performed at blinding speed. Players shoot goals, throw pies and even play poker in the middle of rowdy races around off-road tracks.</li> <li>Having your vehicles drive, walk or fly around the track quickly is one thing, but it\'s more important to go around in style. Players earn stars for huge jumps, cool tricks and daring feats at high speed.</li> <li>Six players can race online* via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection in both <i>Excite</i> Race and Poker Race modes. If friends can\'t join online, players can exchange ghost data via WiiConnect24 and challenge their friends to outdo their most daring tricks.</li> <li>2-player multiplayer versus mode featuring split screen display is also available for local play.</li> </ul> <b>Special Moves</b><br/> Just as in <i>ExciteTruck</i>, drivers can hit blocks that morph the terrain before their eyes and create ramps from which players can launch mega-jumps. Players can aim for and swing around boost bars or open presents that unleash a variety of wild items, such as bottle rocket boosts or clacker mouths that chomp on other racers to slow them down. <p/> <b>Mini-Games</b><br/> Now what about those mini-games. Do you know of any other game that features high-speed robotic racers combined with bowling, poker, clown faces and sandwich making? Didn\'t think so, but how do these game work? <ul> <li><b>Soccer</b>: Drive into the soccer ball and attempt to hit it into the goal.</li> <li><b>Bowling</b>: Drive through the pins and attempt to get a strike.</li> <li><b>Darts</b>: Line up your bot and let the dart fly. Try to hit bull\'s-eye in the distance.</li> <li><b>Clowns</b>: Hit the clown in the face with a pie by throwing it at just the right angle and speed.</li> <li><b>Sandwiches</b>: Drive through the ingredients in the proper order to make a delicious sandwich.</li> </ul> *Note that broadband access is required for online play. </td> </tr> </table>']","by

As these survivors\' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Although designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay in <i>Extraction</i> is also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also, <i>Extraction</i> is a \'rail shooter,\' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PC <i>Dead Space</i> release. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space, <i>Dead Space Extraction</i> utilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote\'s pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis. <p/> Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn\'t become too easy. In addition, <i>Extraction</i> also features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and more <i>Dead Space</i> for players on the Wii. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>An All-New Prequel Exclusively for the Wii</b></li> <ul> <li>Follow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.</li> <li>Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.</li> </ul> <li><b>Real Terror</b></li> <ul> <li>Stunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.</li> <li>Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.</li> </ul> <li><b>Intuitive Controls</b></li> <ul> <li>Strategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.</li> <li>Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.</li> </ul> <li><b>Co-Op Gameplay</b></li> <ul> <li>Team up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.</li> <li>Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.</li> </ul> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

As the game begins Batman is personally delivering his nemesis, The Joker, to the asylum at Arkham Island, but he is uneasy. Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker\'s intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker\'s intricate plot? <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br> In <i>Batman: Arkham Asylum</i> players strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don\'t expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman\'s skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker\'s underlying scheme is. <p/> In addition to the story-driven single player campaign <i>Arkham Asylum</i> also contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman\'s physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as \'Invisible Predator\' utilizes the Dark Knight\'s skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman.

This time around, those crazy Rabbids have what they consider an infallible plan: collect all the human stuff they can find, haul away, heap it onto a giant pile and literally climb home to the moon. Crazy? yes, but that\'s the Rabbid\'s story and they are sticking to it. But not so fast! The humans revolt, unleashing the Verminators, a bumbling group of shock troops whose only objective is to exterminate the Rabbids before they haul away everything that the humans have. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Unlike the action of previous <i>Rabbids</i> games which were made up of a compilation of mini-games, <i>Rabbids Go Home</i> is more of a driving adventure/platformer game. Set in both indoor and outdoor 3D environments, action is mission-based, 40+ in all, and built around the Rabbids desire to get to the moon. Keeping with the franchises irreverent, over-the-top humor, the Rabbid\'s chosen means of doing this is to simply steal enough stuff from humans, pile it up and ascend that pile all the way to the moon. Since the moon is a long way away, a lot of stuff is needed to get there and this is where the player comes in. <p/> Progressing through the open-world missions players control a team of two Rabbids, and their main tool used in collecting items, a shopping cart. Movement of all three are controlled via the Wii Remote/nunchuck controller configuration, with a speed boost available by hitting the ""A"" button. Items to be collected vary widely, ranging all the way from clothing literally scared off paranoid humans, to livestock, with collection areas occurring both horizontally and vertically throughout the gameplay area. Items that can be collected appear as circled in the gameplay environment, and the more mess and mayhem that your Rabbids create, the more items become available. Again, since the pile the Rabbids need to accumulate is hefty, the game features a checkpoint system where you can offload your stash and go back for more without taking the chance of losing what you have. When done collecting, items are flushed down a toilet, leading to a sewer pipe, that leads to the ever-growing pile. But gameplay is more than just a scavenger hunt. Eventually players have to deal with a mobilized resistance by humans to the Rabbids behavior made up of a combination of the anti-Rabbid Verminator corps, waves of surveillance robots and kennels full of attack dogs, all determined to exterminate the Rabbids. Players can also look forward to 2-player mission support and several online features. <p/> <b>Customization</b><br/> <i>Rabbids Go Home</i> also contains a Wii-specific customization mode, known as ""Ze Wiimote,"" which mimics what the inside of players\' Wii remotes would look like if a Rabbid was literally inside it. Here players can can customize the look of their Rabbids with spray paint and sticker effects, and save their favorite versions for use in-game and trading with friends. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>The Rabbids First Comedy-Adventure</b> - Control two Raving Rabbids and their shopping cart and cause mayhem in a world full of uptight humans with shopping on the brain. Collect varying sizes of human stuff to build the Rabbids sky-high pile of junk in their quest to reach the moon.</li> <li><b>Make a huge mess and provoke hilarious situations in over 15 striking game environments</b> - Scour through supermarkets, race across rooftops, jet past airports and boost through the Bayou, visiting the game&rsquo;s unique take on everyday places.</li> <li><b>Play over 40 missions</b> - Race, chase, boost and generally run amok while scaring the Humans right down to their undies - literally! Ridicule reams of relentless enemies and their nasty pooches in an increasingly paranoid world of Rabbid-haters.</li> <li><b>Unique Art Direction</b> - Encounter a cast of colorful, oddball characters and explore a remarkable parody of the modern world as if you were living inside an interactive cartoon.</li> <li><b>Variety of Gameplay</b> - Soup up your shopping cart with a Jet Ski, an airplane reactor, or a hospital Bubble Bed to wreak endless havoc everywhere you turn. Learn to pilot your cart while boosting, jumping, gliding, floating and flying.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

With the help of Alice Murray, their mission coordinator, they now run their own paramilitary business, known as TransWorld Operations (TWO). Working what seems to be a routine mission in Shanghai they find themselves surrounded by a force of competing private military contractors intent on running amok in the city. Will Rios and Salem survive? Will they be able to make a few bucks off a bad situation? All they have is each other to rely on. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> As with the original <i>Army of Two</i>, and as the name of the series implies, gameplay in <i>Army of Two: The 40th Day</i> revolves around co-op combat tactics necessary to survive specific and general combat situations. Players can team up with an AI companion in single player mode or a human friend in two-player co-op. Co-op tactics are made aware to the player in what is known as the co-op playbook. Unlike the original game, which in some instances limited the use of some tactics to certain situations, in <i>The 40th Day</i>, players have access to all tactics. Implementing these against opponents revolves around the game\'s ""Aggro"" system, tallied in the heads-up-display (HUD) and which measures the amount of attention a team member draws from opponents for certain tactics, leaving the other team member in various states of freedom to launch coordinated attacks as chosen. In addition to this change, players are also faced with moral dilemmas in the game, including choices presented to one of the players on a team that the other must bear the consequences of, as well as the decision as to deal with and/or defend civilian non-player characters (NPCs), who can be killed in the game. <p/> <b>Multiplayer Modes</b><br/> In addition to its single player campaign, <i>Army of Two: The 40th Day</i> offers a robust, region-free, multiplayer experience that provides an array of unique features for up to 12 players at a time. This experience consists of four modes, including, three brand-new modes that provide a variety of objectives for partners to battle over. The four modes are: <ul> <li><b>Co-op Deathmatch</b> - An intense battle of survival between up to six two-player partnerships. Only by mastering teamwork and partnership skills will players earn the most points and come out on top.</li> <li><b>Control</b> - Sets players partnerships as TWO or FDI rival faction members as they aim to capture strategic locations in the city. Work with your partner and faction to control the most points within the time limit.</li> <li><b>Warzone</b> - Is an all-out objective-based battle between TWO and FDI forces. Complete the most Destruction, Assassination, VIP, and Infiltration missions with your partner and faction to crush the opposition and win.</li> <li><b>Extraction</b> - Pits a team of four players against a series of unique enemy waves as they move from point to point in the ruined city. Players must strategize as a unified team to combat the different forces of the 40th Day Initiative while trying to get out alive. Extraction is a bonus mode that will be available for free one month after Army of Two: The 40th Day is released, or at launch for players who pre-ordered.</li> </ul> <b>Weapons Customization</b><br/> <i>Army of Two: The 40th Day</i> features the most advanced weapons customization ever seen in a video game.

The goal is to exact revenge upon conspirators who have framed and executed loved ones; the goal is to be accomplished through assassination. <BR> As players roam the crowded streets of Florence, Italy, they can creep through catacombs and corridors, undertake diverse side-missions, and tail-and-assassinate all manner of human targets-politicians, Templar soldiers, and conspirators. Players can also brawl with family rivals or engage in sword fights with Templar soldiers, but in most cases, they use stealth techniques to complete the mission; for example, players can sneak up on enemies from behind and kill them with hidden daggers, poisoned daggers, spring-activated blades, and swords.<BR> When blades connect, blood shoots out in a fountain-like manner as targets groan or scream. These stealth-kills are sometimes depicted close-up and are somewhat graphic: the camera follows the ""herky-jerky"" thrusts of the blade; the player hears a distinctly ""wet"" flesh-impact sound. The most graphic depictions of violence occur during cinematic cut-scenes. <BR> A short live-action movie (i.e., not animated) is included with the game. During a dramatic sword fight, an enemy\'s throat gets slashed-exposing a wide gash in his neck-as the body flails in front of the camera. The spurts and sprays of blood that accompany some of the stabbing attacks can be intense.<BR> The', 'The world of the assassin is one cloaked in shadow and steeped in danger.

Combining authentic rhythm/music gaming experience of <i>Rock Band</i> with the accessibility, customization and humor of LEGO games, <i>LEGO Rock Band</i> allows players to create their own unique rock star style and customize their own avatars, band members, roadies, and managers. <style type=""text/css""> .caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; } </style> <p/> <table align=left width=210 cellpadding=0 height=""44""> <tr> <td height=""44"" valign=""top""><img alt=""LEGO Rock Band game logo"" title=""LEGO Rock Band game logo"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/lego.rb.logo.200.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""200"" height=""44""> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Action in <i>LEGO Rock Band</i> for DS is true to the <i>Rock Band</i> standard of play found in other releases in the franchise, only with a LEGO twist. Your goal is to run through a succession of rock tinged, family friendly song tracks with your band. Bandmates are indicated by four separate avatars representing your guitar player, bass guitarist, drummer and vocalist. The game doesn\'t need a peripheral like other music games on the DS, instead the player indicates the appropriate rhythm for each bandmate in turn through a combination of the DS\' D-Pad, face buttons, mic and eventually its stylus. Players switch between parts using the shoulder buttons. The game also supports 2-4 person multiplayer over a DS multi-card Wi-Fi connection. One of the fun LEGO influences is in the tablature flowing across the screen that directs your play. This is in the form of LEGO blocks color coded for each controller. As with all <i>Rock Band</i> games, consistency gains the player multipliers which earns them more points. As players successfully complete songs and rock challenges, they can collect LEGO \'studs,\' with which they can customize their avatar and other in-game goodies in true LEGO Snap-On fashion. In addition, players can unlock additional content and collect amazing vehicles, which can be used to transport their band from local gigs at rock clubs to epic stadium shows and even fantasy settings on Earth and beyond. The game contains a variety of play modes including Quickplay and Challenge, which guarantees varied gameplay. <p/> <b>The Song List</b><br/> <i>LEGO Rock Band</i> for DS/BSI allows players to rock along to both current hits and classic favorites that the whole family will enjoy. These include: <ul> <li>All American Rejects - ""Swing, Swing""</li> <li>The Automatic - ""Monster""</li> <li>Blur - ""Song 2""</li> <li>Carl Douglas - ""Kung Fu Fighting""</li> <li>Counting Crows - ""Accidentally in Love""</li> <li>David Bowie - ""Let\'s Dance""</li> <li>Europe - ""The Final Countdown""</li> <li>Good Charlotte - ""Girls &amp;

The game provides players with a new story, more puzzles, a new mode of transportation--by train--and a new companion in combat, the Phantom. Together these offer up new possibilities for problem-solving, adventure and fun to both longtime and new fans of the franchise alike. <style type=""text/css""> .caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; } </style> <p/> <table align=left width=210 cellpadding=0> <tr> <td valign=""top""> <div align=""center""><img alt=""The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks game logo"" title=""The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks game logo"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.logo.200.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""200"" height=""107""></div> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Propulsion and Problem-solving</b><br/> One of the most prominent features of <i>The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</i> is the ability to travel by rail throughout the game. When Link conducts the train, players enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as they determine which track to take and how to best manipulate their speed. When on the train, Link must plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks. <p/> <table align=right width=360 cellpadding=0> <tr> <td height=""179"" valign=""top""> <div align=""center""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=810,height=583\'); return false;""><img alt=""The Phantom, Link and Link\'s locomotive from The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks"" title=""The Phantom, Link and Link\'s locomotive from The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.01.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""350"" height=""249""></a><br> <span class=""caption"">New adventure, a new means of transport, and a new companion.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=810,height=583\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </div> </td> </tr> </table> <b>The Phantom</b><br/> In <i>The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</i>, Link has a valuable new companion in combat and puzzle-solving, the Phantom. A faceless knight in a hulking suit of armor with immunities to dangerous elements like fire and magma, the Phantom responds to Link\'s directional commands. Players can simply tap the Phantom with their stylus to take command of him, then draw a line on the touch screen to direct him where to go. He will engage enemies automatically when he comes within range of them. The stout Phantom can also be used as a platform to carry Link above and over dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm or help finish off an enemy. <p/> <b>New In-game Items</b><br/> <i>Spirit Tracks</i> also introduces a variety of new items and weapons to <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> franchise. One of the most notable is the Whirlwind, which Link uses to move items and overturn enemies. Players activate this by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS or Nintendo DSi system. Other new items include a whip, useful both in combat and in platforming, as well as his train\'s cannon, which can shoot bombs into the distance. <p/> <b>Map Functionality</b><br/> As with <i>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</i>, in <i>Spirit Tracks</i> players can look forward to helpful interactive map functionality. The game map appears on the system\'s top screen, as opposed to the action on the bottom, and players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen. This allows players to quickly mark spots in the game world of note for later exploration, or to note them as already explored. </td> </tr> </table> <br/> <b>Screenshots</b>:<br/> <table cellspacing=""0"" align=""center""> <tr> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=414\'); return false;""><img alt=""In-game screen of Link\'s train and train controls in The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks"" title=""In-game screen of Link\'s train and train controls in The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.02.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">New train transport.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=414\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <td><div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.03.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=414\'); return false;""><img alt=""Stylus driven controls of the Phantom in combat in a dungeon crawl with Link in The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks"" title=""Stylus driven controls of the Phantom in combat in a dungeon crawl with Link in The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.03.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Phantom functionality.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.03.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=414\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=414\'); return false;""><img alt=""Link taking on a boss in The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks"" title=""Link taking on a boss in The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.04.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br/> <center> <span class=""caption"">Impressive boss battles.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=414\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> <td> <div align=""center""> <table align=center width=200 cellpadding=3> <tr> <td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.05.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=414\'); return false;""><img alt=""Map screenshot of Link and the Phantom in a lava filled dungeon in The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks"" title=""Map screenshot of Link and the Phantom in a lava filled dungeon in The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.05.sm.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""150""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Easy to use maps.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001TOQ8UW.05.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=276,height=414\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table></div> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> An space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay in <i>Mass Effect 2</i> revolves around the player\'s particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background. <p/> Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance in <i>Mass Effect 2</i>, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs. <p/> <b>Integration with the Original <i>Mass Effect</i></b><br/> <i>Mass Effect 2</i> allows players of the original <i>Mass Effect</i> game to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time in <i>Mass Effect 2</i> will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Futuristic Weapons</b> - Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.</li> <li><b>Elite Specialists</b> - Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy\'s most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission. Train and equip your team to survive insurmountable odds.</li> <li><b>Explore the Galaxy</b> - Scan planets to uncover unique secret missions in the <i>Mass Effect</i> universe.</li> <li><b>Integration with Original <i>Mass Effect</i></b> - Players of the first <i>Mass Effect</i> can import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. New players will find a thrilling stand-alone adventure awaits them, a polished and action packed journey that surpasses the first game in nearly every possible way.</li> <li><b>Intense Third-Person Combat</b> - Increased intensity with precision shooter controls to let you control the action and overcome insurmountable odds.</li> <li><b>New Damage System</b> - New location based damage system allows for targeting of key weak points, blasting off limbs, igniting enemies, or cripple and disable enemy troops.</li> <li><b>Character Customization</b> - Choose a player class, customize your appearance, and tailor your own abilities and strengths. As you progress, so do Shepard&rsquo;s abilities.</li> <li><b>Improved Dialogue Mechanic</b> - Improved NPC conversation system where Commander Shepard can take matters into your own hands &ndash; interrupting or using force to get the answer required.</li> </ul> <td> <tr> </table>']","by

Prepare yourself for uncertain leads, an illusive saboteur, the disappearance of an ancient mummy, a strange murder and perhaps more&hellip;the plot thickens. <p/> <b>Story</b><br/> Set in London in 1899, in <i>Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery of the Mummy</i> the famous detective comes to the aid of Elizabeth Montcalfe. In mourning, and unable to accept Scotland Yard\'s conclusion that her father, the famous British Archeologist Lord Montcalfe, committed suicide in a recent fire, she is convinced that there is much more to the situation than a suicide and that her father may even yet be alive. Determined to find the truth, whatever it may be, Holmes sets about exploring the expansive Montcalf mansion and its rooms packed full of the Egyptian artifacts and treasures that Lord Montcalfe collected over the years. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br> The first appearance of the popular <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> game franchise on the Nintendo DS platform, <i>The Mystery of the Mummy</i> is a single player port of game developer Frogwares\' PC game of the same name. On accepting the challenge of solving the mystery behind Lord Montcalfe\'s ""disappearance,"" players set about exploring his Victorian mansion and searching for clues within its many rooms, levels and amongst the Egyptian artifacts that are strewn about. Holmes sees things from a first-person perspective, both horizontally and vertically. This means that players can explore almost everywhere within the game\'s 3D rendered environment. This is easily done using the DS stylus by tapping and dragging the touchscreen to the spot that you want to go. The stylus also facilitates exploration just as easily through a tap and hold movement that will identify any interactive opportunities within range of the stylus. Once a sleuthing opportunity has been identified the onscreen pointer will change to a magnifying glass, which with an additional tap will allow for an enlarged view. <p/> Clues are automatically added to the onboard inventory panel, located on the DS\' top screen and accessed via the \'L\' and \'R\' buttons. Found items are also added to the inventory and can be used in specific situations and in some cases combined to create a new valuable item. There is space within the inventory panel for notepad functionality that allows players to compose theories and keep track of game events as they like. Finally the game also contains an ongoing series of point and click mathematical, visual and memorization based brainteasers. These serve both to drive the game forward and as side play opportunities away from the main mission. These puzzles vary in difficulty, but with the game\'s integrated help system players can be assured that they will never be stuck. <p/> <b>Key Features</b>: <ul> <li>Inspired by the writings of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his famous super sleuth Sherlock Holmes.</li> <li>A wonderfully appointed, atmospheric and graphically detailed mansion gameplay environment.</li> <li>Numerous interesting objects and clues to search for, collect and use during gameplay.</li> <li>Point and click mathematical, visual and memorization brainteasing puzzles.</li> <li>Integrated help system so players are never hopelessly stumped.</li> <li>Basic item creation functionality to facilitate interactive gameplay.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Just point and go with the Wii remote, and you\'ll be throwing game-winning touchdown passes and grinding out yardage on the ground, or if on defense covering your men downfield and blitzing past the line of scrimmage. <p/> <b>Skill Level Play Calling</b><br/> No matter what level of experience players have with the <i>Madden</i> franchise and/or football in general, <i>Madden NFL 10</i> for Wii makes calling the right play at the right time easy with three play call settings: All Play, Intermediate and Advanced. Within these options players have further flexibility with even more play calling options including: the ""Ask Madden"" help option, a play types overview and an list of reusable plays recently ran. <p/> <b>Call Your Shots</b><br/> Last year\'s favorite <i>Madden NFL</i> feature is now on defense. With offensive players in motion do you feel the need to switch gears and go for the blitz or drop a player or two back to add coverage in the secondary on the fly? No problem, simply select players and drag them to the spot on the field that you want them positioned. Just remember that your opponent is watching your moves as well, and in local play can see your on-screen pointer, meaning that he/she may counter your changes if you make your move too quickly. <p/> <b>Huddle Up Co-op Mode &amp; the Road to the Super Bowl</b><br> In the Huddle Up co-op mode, a less experienced player has an opportunity to impact individual plays in a big way. Help your teammate by using the pointer to throw an extra block or trip up a receiver. And in the Road to the Super Bowl, play with your friends as a team as you throw you join forces on the field to attain pro football\'s ultimate title. Players can jump in and out throughout the season as you work together to become the national champs.<p/> <b>Spotlight Moments</b><br/> What\'s a Wii game without a mini-game or two? With that in mind <i>Madden NFL 10</i> features Spotlight Moments, play-specific mini-games that occur a few times during a game. Often occurring at crucial points, for example as a receiver and defender jostle for position in the endzone, Spotlight Moments are built around zoomed in camera angles and allow players to experience the heightened drama of game-changing plays as action slows down and the outcome of a play and perhaps even the game falls to players\' skills at button mashing with the Wii remote. <p/> <b>Madden Showdown</b><br/> Madden Showdown is a 1-4 player tournament. Enjoy classic 11-on-11 football or experience the thrill of playing 5-on-5 in this quick, customizable competition, as you and your friends go head-to-head in an effort to become the next Showdown Champion. There are three major feature components to Madden Showdown: <ul> <li><u>Game Changers</u> - The rules of NFL football have remained largely the same for many years with little to no deviation. Game Changers allows you to change all of that with a click of the Wiimote. Users can mix and match between eight different options, each placing a unique spin on the game.</li> <li><u>Prediction System</u> - Winning on the field isn\'t everything. The prediction system gives you a chance to predict the outcome of three different categories per game. To top it off, you have the option to risk your points in order to get ahead.

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin\'s hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin\'s final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation\'s shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can\'t afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America\'s answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now. <p/> <b>Gameplay and Weapons</b><br/> Action in <i>Singularity</i> is a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are: <ol> <u>Reversion</u> - The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.<br/> <u>Aging</u> - The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.<br/> <u>Stasis</u> - The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.<br/> <u>Impulse</u> - The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.<br/> <u>Chronolite</u> - Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.<br/> </ol> Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD\'s combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12. <p/> <b>Multiplayer</b><br/> <i>Singularity</i> contains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li>An engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.</li> <li>An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.</li> <li>Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.</li> <li>Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.</li> <li>Multiplayer gameplay options.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin\'s hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin\'s final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation\'s shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can\'t afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America\'s answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now. <p/> <b>Gameplay and Weapons</b><br/> Action in <i>Singularity</i> is a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are: <ol> <u>Reversion</u> - The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.<br/> <u>Aging</u> - The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.<br/> <u>Stasis</u> - The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.<br/> <u>Impulse</u> - The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.<br/> <u>Chronolite</u> - Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.<br/> </ol> Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD\'s combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12. <p/> <b>Multiplayer</b><br/> <i>Singularity</i> contains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li>An engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.</li> <li>An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.</li> <li>Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.</li> <li>Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.</li> <li>Multiplayer gameplay options.</li> <li>Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin\'s hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin\'s final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation\'s shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can\'t afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America\'s answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now. <p/> <b>Gameplay and Weapons</b><br/> Action in <i>Singularity</i> is a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are: <ol> <u>Reversion</u> - The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.<br/> <u>Aging</u> - The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.<br/> <u>Stasis</u> - The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.<br/> <u>Impulse</u> - The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.<br/> <u>Chronolite</u> - Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.<br/> </ol> Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD\'s combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12. <p/> <b>Multiplayer</b><br/> <i>Singularity</i> contains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li>An engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.</li> <li>An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.</li> <li>Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.</li> <li>Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.</li> <li>Multiplayer gameplay options.</li> <li>PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

You and your team of Marvel super heroes help Nick Fury launch a secret pre-emptive strike against Latveria and Lucia Von Bardas only to have to thwart her retalitaory attack on New York City. <p/> Coupled with other super hero incidents, public sentiment turns against super heroes. The Superhuman Registration Act becomes law and super heroes must register as weapons of mass destruction, and become licensed government agents with the United States government. Lines are drawn as Iron Man leads the pro-registration faction, while Captain America spearheads the stand on anti-registration. You must pick a side and fight to determine the fate of the universe and humankind. So, whose side are you on. <p/> <b>Playable Characters</b><br/> <i>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2</i> will feature a wide array of playable heroes and villains, some of which are available from the beginning of the game, while others will need to be unlocked. Although the final list was not available at publishing time, some of the faces from the Marvel universe that players can count on seeing include: Daredevil, Green Goblin, Human Torch, Invisible Woman, Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man, Luke Cage, Mr. Fantastic, Deadpool, Juggernaut, Thing, Spider-Man, Storm, Songbird, Thor, Iron Fist, Wolverine, Venom and Gambit. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> As with the original <i>Marvel Ultimate Alliance</i>, the new version of the game is an action RPG in which players create their own fighting team made up of four super heroes/villains. The makeup of teams can be changed as the player chooses, and characters can be leveled up as they gain experience and the game progresses. In addition, the separate powers of super heroes can be combined, or ""fused,"" resulting in unique abilities that are devastating in combat. The game contains over 250 of these fused powers that only await the right combination in battle to be released. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Create and Customize Your Ultimate Team</b> - Assemble your dream team from the Marvel universe and select from over 24 playable heroes and villains, each with specialized powers.</li> <li><b>Cooperate with Your Ultimate Alliance</b> - Take full advantage of the Marvel universe by playing Cooperative Mode with up to four friends, both online and offline.</li> <li><b>Choose a Side in Marvel&rsquo;s Civil War</b> - Pick a side in the ultimate ideological rift that could yield irreparable consequences for the super hero community.

Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong. <p/> <table align=right width=250 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td height=""194""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.01.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""Commander Shepard ambushing a mech in Mass Effect 2"" title=""Commander Shepard ambushing a mech in Mass Effect 2"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.01.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""250"" height=""141""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">The return of Commander Shepard.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.01.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> <tr> <td height=""194""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""New characters from Mass Effect 2"" title=""New characters from Mass Effect 2"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.02.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""250"" height=""141""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">A new cast of characters.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.02.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> <tr> <td height=""194""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.03.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""The Turian Garrus Vakarian from Mass Effect 2"" title=""The Turian Garrus Vakarian from Mass Effect 2"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.03.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""250"" height=""141""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Along with familiar faces from the past.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.03.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> <tr> <td height=""194""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.04.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""Mass Effect 2\'s new damage system illustrated as an enemy continues to pursue Shepard even with its legs are blown off"" title=""Mass Effect 2\'s new damage system illustrated as an enemy continues to pursue Shepard even with its legs are blown off"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.04.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""250"" height=""141""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">New damage and dialogue systems.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.04.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> <tr> <td height=""194""><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.09.lg.jpg"" onClick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;""><img alt=""Taking aim at evil zombie thingie in Mass Effect 2"" title=""Taking aim at evil zombie thingie in Mass Effect 2"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.09.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""250"" height=""141""></a><br> <center> <span class=""caption"">Integration with original game.<br/> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mass.effect2.09.lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> An space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay in <i>Mass Effect 2</i> revolves around the player\'s particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background. <p/> Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance in <i>Mass Effect 2</i>, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs. <p/> <b>Integration with the Original <i>Mass Effect</i></b><br/> <i>Mass Effect 2</i> allows players of the original <i>Mass Effect</i> game to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return, as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time in <i>Mass Effect 2</i> will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Futuristic Weapons</b> - Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.</li> <li><b>Elite Specialists</b> - Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy\'s most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission. Train and equip your team to survive insurmountable odds.</li> <li><b>Explore the Galaxy</b> - Scan planets to uncover unique secret missions in the <i>Mass Effect</i> universe.</li> <li><b>Integration with Original <i>Mass Effect</i></b> - Players of the first <i>Mass Effect</i> can import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. New players will find a thrilling stand-alone adventure awaits them, a polished and action packed journey that surpasses the first game in nearly every possible way.</li> <li><b>Intense Third-Person Combat</b> - Increased intensity with precision shooter controls to let you control the action and overcome insurmountable odds.</li> <li><b>New Damage System</b> - New location based damage system allows for targeting of key weak points, blasting off limbs, igniting enemies, or crippling and disabling enemy troops.</li> <li><b>Character Customization</b> - Choose a player class, customize your appearance, and tailor your own abilities and strengths. As you progress, so do Shepard&rsquo;s abilities.</li> <li><b>Improved Dialogue Mechanic</b> - Improved NPC conversation system where Commander Shepard can take matters into your own hands &ndash; interrupting or using force to get the answer required.</li> </ul> <h4>System Requirements:</h4> <table border=1 cellpadding=""3""> <tr> <td width=""10%""></td> <td align=center width=""45%""> <b>Minimum Specifications:</b></td> <td align=center width=""45%""><b>Recommended Specifications:</b></td> <tr> <td width=""10%"">OS:</td> <td colspan=""2"" align=center>Windows XP or Vista.</td> </tr><tr valign=""top""> <td width=""10%"">Processor:</td> <td align=center width=""45%"">2.4+ GHz Intel or 2.0+ GHz AMD</td> <td align=center width=""45%"">2.6+ GHz Intel or 2.4+ GHZ AMD</td> </tr><tr> <td width=""10%"">RAM:</td> <td align=center width=""45%"">1GB+ (XP), 2GB+ (Vista)</td> <td align=center width=""45%"">2GB+</td> </tr><tr> <td width=""10%"">Disc Drive:</td> <td colspan=2 align=center>8x DVD-ROM drive or better</td> </tr><tr valign=""top""> <td width=""10%"">Hard Drive:</td> <td colspan=""2"" align=center>12GB or more</td> </tr> <tr valign=""top""> <td width=""10%"">Video Card:</td> <td align=center width=""45%"">NVIDIA GeForce 6 series (6800GT or better), ATI 1300XT or better (X1550, X1600 Pro and HD2400 are below minimum system requirements)</td> <td align=center width=""45%"">NVIDIA GeForce 7900 GTX or higher.

Once in the digital world, Geo can merge with the electronic life-form known as Omega-Xis to become Mega Man. And Mega Man\'s help is definitely needed.

Fortunately, Mega Man discovers that as dangerous as the noise is, he can also control it using the new Noise Change system to transform into his Red Joker form. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> As in the previous games, <i>Mega Man Star Force 3: Red Joker</i> is a unique blend of action and role-playing game (RPG), combining the high intensity combat that is the hallmark of <i>Mega Man</i> games with <i>Star Force</i>&rsquo;s strategic battle system.

The Noise Ratio increases in different situations. As the Noise Ratio increases there are different effects.</li> <li>Cyber battles feature an immersive third person view as players engage enemies in a 3x5 battle grid.</li> <li>Cards now stack and are scattered randomly. Only the top card can be used when stacked.

Color-coated and pulsating for both the batter and pitcher to see, balls struck well within this area are most likely to result in a hit, but there are no guarantees. Although it is a dangerous place for pitchers to throw, the Wheelhouse is also a tempting spot for pitchers to challenge hitters since not only do strikes result in the shrinking of a player\'s wheelhouse, but strikes and strikeouts centered there will earn the defensive team turbo points that can be used elsewhere in the game. <p/> <b>Legendary Rated Players</b><br/> <i>The Bigs 2</i> features a special Legendary Rating system for players as they develop. On defense a high rating means a player will be able to get to balls other players can\'t, which will make them very valuable against high-powered offensive team. In addition, players with high status are capable of spectacular plays, like jumping into the stands to rob a batter of a home-run, pulling down come-backers off the bat of opponents, etc. When these plays are made players will gain access to play specific mini-games as a reward, that are designed to be fun and further hone their skills in these specific areas. Along with the two mentioned above, players can also expect to see mini-games available to legendary rated players such as handling line drives up the middle, diving plays in both the infield and outfield and foul balls pulled from the hands of fans.', 'Legendary status is not limited to defensive fielding positions though. Pitchers can possess a legendary skill rating that allows them the possibility of domination on the mound. Batter\'s legendary ranking can also be utilized both by the power and skill they bring as they step up to the plate, as well as in some cases an ability to increase the potency of their teammates skill in the batters box. An example of this is an enlarged wheelhouse for the batter that follows a player with a high legendary ranking or even the entire lineup. In these cases the value and strategy of having legendary players available for insertion into the roster is obvious. <p/> <b>The Big Slam</b><br/> Similar to functionality in the first game in the series that allowed players who had accumulated enough turbo points a strikeout or home run when they wanted/needed it, <i>The Bigs 2</i> brings the \'Big Slam\' to the field. In this case offensive players who have enough turbo points can opt to take on a series of pitches in an attempt at a simplified grand slam.

Instead of the one-off ploys and minor misdirections enacted at players\' discretion seen in other games, <em>R.U.S.E.</em> Raises deception to the level of an integral battlefield tactic. Deceptive tactics, known as ""Ruses,"" allow players to do things like bluff enemies in order to lead your nation\'s army to victory, camouflage your troops, lure your opponent with decoy units, sabotage his logistics and more. Ruses are built into the game\'s mechanics in the form of ""cards"" that can be played at particular times.

Each have specific units, strengths, tendencies and tactical deceptive leanings.

In fact, multiplayer is the dominant mode available in <em>R.U.S.E.</em> And players will be able to set up games with their own preferences thanks to several parameters (number of available ruses, conditions of victory, game time, 1939, 1942 or 1945 mode, etc.).', '<strong>Key Game Features</strong>', '<b><i>Steam</i></b> and <b><i>Uplay</i></b> accounts required for game activation and installation']","by
