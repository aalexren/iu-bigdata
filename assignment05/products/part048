Point Blank 2,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""If you went bananas over the original Point Blank you'll go APE over the sequel! Point Blank 2 is everything you loved about the original but this time it's even better. Loaded with over 70 all-new wild-and-crazy shooting scenarios Point Blank 2 is so much fun you won't be able to put your gun down!"", 'The Japanese version of Namco\'s Point Blank 2, GunBarl, came out overseas about nine months ago - just months after the US release of the original game, Point Blank (or Gun Bullet, as it was called in arcades and in Japan). Now Point Blank 2, the shoot-\'em-up puzzle sequel has arrived in the States. The game, like its Japanese counterpart, is not an arcade port, but rather a console-specific game geared expressly to the home audience. How does it fare? Very well indeed. Point Blank 2 is a toughened up a step beyond the Japanese version, yet it includes the same modes, such as a theme-park mode in place of the RPG-like storyline of the first game. There\'s also a party mode with a two-to-four-player tournament, a team battle, a really fun turf war, and the Point Blank Castle, which includes versus and endurance modes. Theoretically, in single-player and multiplayer modes, you have the same sort of timed ""target"" challenges that the first game offered. These challenges test your ability to shoot straight and often in rapid succession, with limited time, ammo, or both. In single player, you can start off with a training mode that recommends the next stage you should try - depending on how well you do, of course. The practice levels are painfully easy and often suggest you go to an advanced round next, but then the advanced levels will beat you soundly and suggest you go back to beginner. As in the Japanese game, the practice level has four rounds, and the beginner and advanced levels each have 16. And as an added bonus, a new ""insane"" level has been thrown in to up the ante. Once you complete a stage, you receive stats that track your progress, from accuracy to speed of firing. The trick is to make it through all of the courses, finishing each successfully. Also in single player, the theme park mode is much more enjoyable than Point Blank Island was in the first game. As the hero (a young kid with a big gun) in theme-park mode, you must search the park for the king\'s daughter and clear all the stages before you can complete the level. As in the first game, the puzzles in this mode are similar to puzzles in the multiplayer and single-player modes, but with a bit more diversity in their delivery.  Overall, the stages in Point Blank 2 exhibit a greater degree of depth than the original game did. For example, instead of just clearing the bad guys and saving the good guys, you now have bottles sprinkled throughout the level to grab for extra points. Also, the bad guys don\'t just dress the sidewalks, porches, and hallways; now they actually ride by you in buses and truck beds. You get to shoot out the glass of the vehicles before capping the bandit! Clever new puzzles such as one in which you shoot the cork off a champagne bottle and defuse a time bomb make you wonder if the developers had concocted these puzzles by sitting on lawn chairs on their back porches with their BB guns. The vandal levels have expanded as well. Now you shoot out neon signs in Tokyo and destroy a house and tractor with rapid fire. You\'ll even shear sheep with a gun. Pretty slick. But the list of new stages goes on and on (between the original version and the Japanese version of the sequel as well), and they\'re all just as fun, if not more fun, than the original. One thing to note - besides having a greater degree of depth, Point Blank 2 is also considerably more difficult than Point Blank. As expected, the multiplayer mode is even better. This time, you can challenge other players in real-time one-on-one battles. You\'ll have races to destroy the targets or shear the same herd of sheep. Another multiplayer stage finds you knocking off vultures so your character can beat your opponent\'s character to the mountaintop.  The tournament mode is essentially a larger, more focused head-to-head mode, but the team play is quite fun. However, the best new mode has to be the turf war. Up to four players battle for blocks on a layout of a couple dozen squares. The player with the most squares in the end wins. You earn squares by selecting an opponent\'s square and challenging that person to a match. The puzzles you play here are the same puzzles you play throughout the various modes in the game. Graphically, Point Blank 2 is a bit better than Point Blank, and the music is slightly improved as well, offering less of a Casio keyboard sound and more of what could be more aptly referred to as ""penguin techno,"" although it seems that some of the same tunes have returned, and they haven\'t evolved in the least.  The Point Blank 2 challenges have greater depth, they are more difficult, and, in part, they are more sophisticated - you\'ll rely less on your reflexes and more on hard-core hand-eye coordination and your brain - at one point you\'ll have to complete math problems and shoot the correct answers. This game is just as addictive as Point Blank, yet it has greater difficulty and strategy elements, along with the new modes, making the experience one step beyond mesmerizing and quite an authentic challenge. Fans of Point Blank will certainly not be disappointed, and those who thought Point Blank was a bit too remedial will probably feel right at home.<i>--Lauren Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

This was a tough mission to accomplish, but it did so by focusing compelling squad-based tactical gameplay against the backstory of a fictional squad within the US Army\'s 101st Airborne Division as they battle through a historically correct re-creation of the events of the Allied invasion of Europe during WWII. This type of realism is more or less unheard of in the video game world and can only be provided by someone who really knows their stuff. Enter Colonel John Antal, US Army (Ret.).', ""Vice President of Knowledge Operations and Military and Historical Director at Gearbox Software, developers of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series, Colonel Antal is an Airborne-Ranger officer, and a published author of scores of magazine articles, as well as several fiction and nonfiction books on military topics. Most importantly for the subject at hand though, he is also a major force behind the development of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series. Recently I was able to catch up with him and ask some questions regarding the newest title in that line, <em>Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway</em>."", '', '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I just returned from a ten day visit with US and NATO troops in Afghanistan, and I can report to you that when Soldiers are not fighting, they are training for the next fight. The more time Soldiers spend training in realistic simulated battles, the less blood spilled in battle. During my thirty years in the US Army, I trained thousands of Soldiers using constructive, virtual and live military simulations. Once I retired, it was an easy leap for me to switch my experience with military simulations into value-added content for video games.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I know you've probably been asked this question a thousand times, but let's make it a thousand and one. Operation Market Garden, the WWII allied offensive that <em>Hell's Highway</em> is based on culminated in a German victory. Why make a video game based on a defeat?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Market Garden was not a complete success, but war is fought at many levels. At the squad level, war is about fighting for the next hill, hamlet or road junction. Victory and defeat is very clear in a squad - when the battle is over you either have won and lived, or have lost and most of your comrades are dead or wounded. In <em>Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway</em>, we created a historical fiction that is true to the real history of the battle in ways no other game has approached. The true story of the battle for Hells Highway is dramatic and a worthy story. If we told only stories of victories, we wouldn't be telling true historical fiction. War is about victory AND defeat, gain and loss. Telling both is part of being true to the actual history."", '<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: As a follow-up to this, because this game is based on a very real and in many senses, tragic event for the forces involved and the civilian population, was there more pressure to stick to the facts in this game in order to get things right? And if so how did your team ensure this?', ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Yes. We have done our best to make the game the most authentic WWII experience ever. Our goal is to put you in the boots of a true-to-life squad leader in the 101st Airborne during the fight for Hell's Highway. This game addresses the true history of the Battle for Hell's Highway, uses realistic tactics and requires you to lead a rifle squad in ways that no other game has ever done."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: The game's story is centered around the events of an American squad, but since Operation Market Garden was an allied offensive, will players get to control, or even better, play as other allied forces? And will there be any playable German characters?"", '<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/""><img align=""right"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/biahh.novel.jpg"" /></a><strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will play as an American, Staff Sergeant Matt Baker. If you want to learn more about the British, the Dutch Resistance and the Germans, read my companion novel to the game, ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/"">Brothers in Arms, Hell\'s Highway</a>"", published by Ballantine Books, Random House. There will also be a history book out in January 2009 that explains the battle for Hell\'s Highway in day-to-day detail with maps, historical photos, screenshots from the game and much more. Shop for the Colonel\'s companion novel, ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/"">Brothers in Arms, Hell\'s Highway</a>.""', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I've read that <em>Hell's Highway</em> will contain a whole new multiplayer experience. Can you shed some light on how this experience is different from what previous games in the series offered?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Multiplayer is really exciting. Our multiplayer design is different from other games because it brings squad game play on-line. We created a team based game, where the team-based aspect is about squad organization. The game will select (or players will vote on) a commander on each team. There can be up to 20 people in the game, 10 per team. The teams will go after objectives in each map that will be resolved in rounds.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: A common criticism in squad-based games is that AI enemies engaged in singleplayer modes are too easily outwitted, which is obviously something that should not happen on a real battlefield. Was dealing with this a consideration in the development of <em>Hell's Highway</em>?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Yes, the team did a good job at creating a robust enemy AI that is clearly a tough opponent. Players will be excited about this feature.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> will feature a wide variety of weapons, not only used by US forces, but also those of allied troops and the Germans. Are all of these usable by any character and if so does each have specific ammo?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: All the small arms -- pistols and rifles -- will be useable, as well as most of the crew served weapons (like machine guns). Players can choose from semi-automatic rifles such as the M1-Carbine and M1-Garand, to machine guns such as the M1A1, bazookas such as the M9A1 and pistols. To check out all the weapons you can use and see them in action, check out the website (www.brothersinarmsgame.com in 'the game' section)."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> is the first <em>Brother in Arms</em> title to come to Next-Gen platforms. How much has the visual clarity made possible on these platforms helped in the series' ongoing quest for authenticity?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The visual clarity is stunning in this game. It makes use of the Unreal 3 Engine technology to deliver incredibly realistic, authentic and cutting-edge 3D environments. The game also has unprecedented character design - with lifelike characters who look, talk, move and think with incredible realism.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> is the third game in the series featuring Sgt. Matt Baker, and now Sgt. Joe Hartsock. These two have differing views on the acceptable costs of war and have traded off command duties in the last two games. In <em>Hell's Highway</em> both lead separate squads, but Sgt. Baker appears to be front and center. Will the game feature the ability to play as either sergeant? And regardless, is this dichotomy of outlook regarding command as much an attempt at realism in the field as anything else in the game?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will play the role of Baker. The story of Baker and Hartsock, and their different approaches to leadership is a vital part of the story that I many of our fans will find intriguing.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I don't recall tanks playing too much of a role in earlier <em>Brothers in Arms</em> games, but one of the nicer videos I've seen indicated that they might be prominent in <em>Hell's Highway</em>. This seems a nice touch considering that Operation Market Garden's objective was to secure a path for armored units crossing into Germany. What exactly will players be able to do with tanks and what other new units and/or changes to the control scheme can players expect to see?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will be able to fight as part of a Sherman Firefly crew and will be able to battle German Panzers head to head.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: When last I saw <em>Hell's Highway</em> demoed, one of the things that stood out in my mind was the destructibility of environments and cover. Considering that the game in filled with weapons of varying destructive power, I thought this was a fantastic and natural addition. Can you give a few details on this for our readers?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Destructible cover allows the player greater tactical flexibility. Now you can create a flank by blowing away flimsy cover that would normally block your maneuver. The destructible cover system was modeled using real physical properties and behaviors, so weapons will actually damage, dent, scorch and destroy the world around you. It's a great addition to the game that gives players a truly authentic experience."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Having grown up myself watching movies like <em>A Bridge Too Far</em>, <em>The Guns of Navarone</em>/<em>Force 10 From Navarone</em>, <em>Where Eagles Dare</em>, <em>The Dirty Dozen</em>, <em>Kelly's Heroes</em>, <em>The Longest Day</em>, etc. I've often wondered why the events of WWII have not been more heavily mined for game subject matter. With the continued success of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> franchise and others, as well as the power of Next-Gen technology, do you see this changing?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I strongly believe that powerful, dramatic human stories provide an exciting medium for video games. WWII was a vast WORLD WAR with countless powerful, dramatic, human stories. Anyone who is bored with WWII hasn't studied the war in depth. The stories from WWII have importance relevance to us today and are archetypical examples of the moral dilemma of war. No sane person wants war, but if you value life and liberty, sometimes you are forced to fight. I expect that we will be telling these stories and incorporating them into our games for many years to come."", '<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Since the framework of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series is the allied invasion of German-occupied Europe and the battles that would eventually make up the march towards Berlin/the race to beat the Red Army there, can players expect to see more from Sgt. Baker and his squad in the future, perhaps at the Battle of the Bulge and beyond?', '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: As long as I have anything to do with it, the answer is YES.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Finally, because it's interesting to pick the brains of people behind the games, do you mind telling our readers what games you are playing and/or what you are reading these days? Also, I know that you have authored several fiction and nonfiction books as well as articles. Are you working on anything new that you might want to tell us about?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I'm an Airborne-Ranger and have been a combat officer all my adult life. I pretty much like to play anything with WAR in the title!"", '', '--<em>Tom Milnes, Freelance Contributor</em>']","by

This was a tough mission to accomplish, but it did so by focusing compelling squad-based tactical gameplay against the backstory of a fictional squad within the US Army\'s 101st Airborne Division as they battle through a historically correct re-creation of the events of the Allied invasion of Europe during WWII. This type of realism is more or less unheard of in the video game world and can only be provided by someone who really knows their stuff. Enter Colonel John Antal, US Army (Ret.).', ""Vice President of Knowledge Operations and Military and Historical Director at Gearbox Software, developers of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series, Colonel Antal is an Airborne-Ranger officer, and a published author of scores of magazine articles, as well as several fiction and nonfiction books on military topics. Most importantly for the subject at hand though, he is also a major force behind the development of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series. Recently I was able to catch up with him and ask some questions regarding the newest title in that line, <em>Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway</em>."", '', '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I just returned from a ten day visit with US and NATO troops in Afghanistan, and I can report to you that when Soldiers are not fighting, they are training for the next fight.  The more time Soldiers spend training in realistic simulated battles, the less blood spilled in battle. During my thirty years in the US Army, I trained thousands of Soldiers using constructive, virtual and live military simulations. Once I retired, it was an easy leap for me to switch my experience with military simulations into value-added content for video games.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I know you've probably been asked this question a thousand times, but let's make it a thousand and one. Operation Market Garden, the WWII allied offensive that <em>Hell's Highway</em> is based on culminated in a German victory. Why make a video game based on a defeat?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Market Garden was not a complete success, but war is fought at many levels. At the squad level, war is about fighting for the next hill, hamlet or road junction. Victory and defeat is very clear in a squad - when the battle is over you either have won and lived, or have lost and most of your comrades are dead or wounded. In <em>Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway</em>, we created a historical fiction that is true to the real history of the battle in ways no other game has approached. The true story of the battle for Hells Highway is dramatic and a worthy story.  If we told only stories of victories, we wouldn't be telling true historical fiction. War is about victory AND defeat, gain and loss. Telling both is part of being true to the actual history."", '<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: As a follow-up to this, because this game is based on a very real and in many senses, tragic event for the forces involved and the civilian population, was there more pressure to stick to the facts in this game in order to get things right? And if so how did your team ensure this?', ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Yes. We have done our best to make the game the most authentic WWII experience ever. Our goal is to put you in the boots of a true-to-life squad leader in the 101st Airborne during the fight for Hell's Highway. This game addresses the true history of the Battle for Hell's Highway, uses realistic tactics and requires you to lead a rifle squad in ways that no other game has ever done."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: The game's story is centered around the events of an American squad, but since Operation Market Garden was an allied offensive, will players get to control, or even better, play as other allied forces? And will there be any playable German characters?"", '<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/""><img align=""right"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/biahh.novel.jpg"" /></a><strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will play as an American, Staff Sergeant Matt Baker. If you want to learn more about the British, the Dutch Resistance and the Germans, read my companion novel to the game, ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/"">Brothers in Arms, Hell\'s Highway</a>"", published by Ballantine Books, Random House. There will also be a history book out in January 2009 that explains the battle for Hell\'s Highway in day-to-day detail with maps, historical photos, screenshots from the game and much more. Shop for the Colonel\'s companion novel, ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/"">Brothers in Arms, Hell\'s Highway</a>.""', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I've read that <em>Hell's Highway</em> will contain a whole new multiplayer experience. Can you shed some light on how this experience is different from what previous games in the series offered?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Multiplayer is really exciting. Our multiplayer design is different from other games because it brings squad game play on-line. We created a team based game, where the team-based aspect is about squad organization. The game will select (or players will vote on) a commander on each team. There can be up to 20 people in the game, 10 per team. The teams will go after objectives in each map that will be resolved in rounds.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: A common criticism in squad-based games is that    AI enemies engaged in singleplayer modes are too easily outwitted, which is    obviously something that should not happen on a real battlefield. Was dealing    with this a consideration in the development of <em>Hell's Highway</em>?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Yes, the team did a good job at creating a robust enemy AI that is clearly a tough opponent. Players will be excited about this feature.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> will feature a wide variety of weapons, not only used by US forces, but also those of allied troops and the Germans. Are all of these usable by any character and if so does each have specific ammo?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: All the small arms -- pistols and rifles -- will be useable, as well as most of the crew served weapons (like machine guns). Players can choose from semi-automatic rifles such as the M1-Carbine and M1-Garand, to machine guns such as the M1A1, bazookas such as the M9A1 and pistols. To check out all the weapons you can use and see them in action, check out the website (www.brothersinarmsgame.com in 'the game' section)."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> is the first <em>Brother in Arms</em> title to come to Next-Gen platforms. How much has the visual clarity made possible on these platforms helped in the series' ongoing quest for authenticity?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The visual clarity is stunning in this game. It makes use of the Unreal 3 Engine technology to deliver incredibly realistic, authentic and cutting-edge 3D environments. The game also has unprecedented character design - with lifelike characters who look, talk, move and think with incredible realism.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> is the third game in the series featuring Sgt. Matt Baker, and now Sgt. Joe Hartsock. These two have differing views on the acceptable costs of war and have traded off command duties in the last two games. In <em>Hell's Highway</em> both lead separate squads, but Sgt. Baker appears to be front and center. Will the game feature the ability to play as either sergeant? And regardless, is this dichotomy of outlook regarding command as much an attempt at realism in the field as anything else in the game?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will play the role of Baker. The story of Baker and Hartsock, and their different approaches to leadership is a vital part of the story that I many of our fans will find intriguing.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I don't recall tanks playing too much of a role in earlier <em>Brothers in Arms</em> games, but one of the nicer videos I've seen indicated that they might be prominent in <em>Hell's Highway</em>. This seems a nice touch considering that Operation Market Garden's objective was to secure a path for armored units crossing into Germany. What exactly will players be able to do with tanks and what other new units and/or changes to the control scheme can players expect to see?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will be able to fight as part of a Sherman Firefly crew and will be able to battle German Panzers head to head.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: When last I saw <em>Hell's Highway</em> demoed, one of the things that stood out in my mind was the destructibility of environments and cover. Considering that the game in filled with weapons of varying destructive power, I thought this was a fantastic and natural addition. Can you give a few details on this for our readers?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Destructible cover allows the player greater tactical    flexibility. Now you can create a flank by blowing away flimsy cover that would    normally block your maneuver. The destructible cover system was modeled using    real physical properties and behaviors, so weapons will actually damage, dent,    scorch and destroy the world around you. It's a great addition to the game that    gives players a truly authentic experience."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Having grown up myself watching movies like <em>A Bridge Too Far</em>, <em>The Guns of Navarone</em>/<em>Force 10 From Navarone</em>, <em>Where Eagles Dare</em>, <em>The Dirty Dozen</em>, <em>Kelly's Heroes</em>, <em>The Longest Day</em>, etc. I've often wondered why the events of WWII have not been more heavily mined for game subject matter. With the continued success of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> franchise and others, as well as the power of Next-Gen technology, do you see this changing?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I strongly believe that powerful, dramatic human stories provide an exciting medium for video games. WWII was a vast WORLD WAR with countless powerful, dramatic, human stories. Anyone who is bored with WWII hasn't studied the war in depth. The stories from WWII have importance relevance to us today and are archetypical examples of the moral dilemma of war. No sane person wants war, but if you value life and liberty, sometimes you are forced to fight. I expect that we will be telling these stories and incorporating them into our games for many years to come."", '<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Since the framework of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series is the allied invasion of German-occupied Europe and the battles that would eventually make up the march towards Berlin/the race to beat the Red Army there, can players expect to see more from Sgt. Baker and his squad in the future, perhaps at the Battle of the Bulge and beyond?', '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: As long as I have anything to do with it, the answer is YES.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Finally, because it's interesting to pick the brains    of people behind the games, do you mind telling our readers what games you are    playing and/or what you are reading these days? Also, I know that you have authored    several fiction and nonfiction books as well as articles. Are you working on    anything new that you might want to tell us about?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I'm an Airborne-Ranger and have been a combat officer all my adult life. I pretty much like to play anything with WAR in the title!"", '', '--<em>Tom Milnes, Freelance Contributor</em>']","by

Also, not only will players be able to play as and against their favorite classic characters, such as Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Guile, Zangief, Blanka, Sagat, etc., they will also be able to take on new characters.

The first of these are Focus Attacks. These moves allow players to absorb the energy from an attack and quickly counter with their own. Used properly, Focus Attacks allow for tremendous flexibility during combat and are the end result of efforts by the game\'s development team to evolve combat away from the rigid memorization of set combination patterns, giving players the freedom to be creative against opponents. The other new combat feature are new powered up moves called Ultra Combos. Like standard combos their purpose is to unleash maximum damage on an opponent, but unlike the combos of old, when performed correctly these long strings of punches, kicks and moves result in changes to the in-game camera angle and quick cinematics which illustrate the strength of your skills like never before.

Use your SpyGlass to explore clues that will help you figure out who stole an artifact from the museum and where it is hidden. Multiple outcomes and five arcade-style games will keep players entertained for hours.', 'In this Junior version of Clue, kids must figure out who\'s been stealing from the town museum by collecting two ""who"" clues and two ""where"" clues using the process of elimination. They get their clues by searching the five museum wings and talking to staff. Sometimes kids are asked to swap objects for a clue, say a calendar for a bottle of window cleaner. Five simple games are also found scattered throughout the museum with arcade- and concentration-like themes. In one game, for instance, kids zap bugs to help an ape. In another, children match as many fossil pairs as possible within a certain amount of time. The games, which are mediocre in terms of depth and breadth, aren\'t always related to the museum and seem simply thrown into the mix.<P>The program\'s biggest problem, however, is its slow response time between children\'s clicks and the action, making kids wonder sometimes if the program froze up. Also, our testers didn\'t have much luck with the SpyGlass attachment that supposedly can replace the mouse. Children never knew what they would get when they used the SpyGlass to make their selections. In fact, all of our testers ultimately gave up on the gadget and went back to the mouse. On the upside, the graphics are good, looking for clues is lots of fun, and the theme has plenty of kid-appeal. Testers were divided when asked if they\'d buy the program-many said they\'d rather wait for a new version.<br><b>Teaches: </b>game play, logic, memory <br><b>Age Range: </b>5-8 Copyright &#169; 2000 Children\'s Software Revue -- <i><a href=https://secure.tradenet.net/childrenssoftware/csroffer.html>From Children\'s Software Revue&#174; -- ""Subscribe Now!""</a></i>']",CD-ROM Playset,"['>#76,211 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#8,932 in Video Games > PC Games > PC Games']",,Video Games,B000029723

Details of his succession are sketchy, but many feel that his sister Johanna was the heir apparent. Since her untimely death, civil unrest has grown into open rebellion. Karl Sonntag, a staunch loyalist to the Dresari family, turned his back on the fledgling sovereign and was recently arrested for sedition when he publicly condemned the new regime. His fate - as well as those of other political prisoners - is uncertain, but we do know that his leadership could prove invaluable if a resistance is to be mounted against Ian Dresari. After years of faithful service as a Davion lance commander, you found yourself facing a disciplinary review board following a heated dispute with a superior officer.

Casting the line is initiated by flicking the analog stick or - for less patient players - by inputting specific commands to attract fish. Once a fish starts biting, the fight begins. Following the on-screen visual cues, you must carefully balance reeling in the fish while keeping an eye on the line\'s tension so it doesn\'t break. Button combinations can also be used to weaken the fish\'s resolve, allowing for an easier catch. As you progress, additional rods, lures, and live bait become available to improve the odds of landing the ""big one."" Other play options include an Open Fishing mode and a Quick Challenge.

The game was developed by Novalogic and published by Electronic Arts.\n\nGameplay consists of deploying a group of robots to an area and engaging enemy forces. Both sides will typically have a number of robots and a base to protect. Damaged robots can return to the base for repairs. As robots take damage they will become harder to control and use as various systems fail.\n\nThe user can take direct control of one of the robots in field at will, or leave them autonomous in field and provide only strategic goal-driven control from the base.\n\n\n[edit] Robots\nThere are three types of robots available in the game.\n\nHumanoid is the main fighting robot. It is the strongest robot available and can deliver and take the most damage. \nScorpion is the infrastructure maintenance robot. It is slow, fragile, and weak in close combat, but it carries a single-shot missile (its scorpion stinging tail) that is the heaviest weapon in the game. Only Scorpions can lay down or dismantle the power grid. \nScout is the fast agile robot used for recon. It is lightly armed but has the longest range when running on batteries, and is capable of laying mines. \n\n[edit] Power grid\nA unique feature of Ultrabots is the power grid consisting of microwave relays that extend power away from the base dome. Robots straying too far from the base dome or relays have to rely on their batteries only, which don't last long and don't offer enough range to reach the enemy base. Much of strategy in the game relies on the power infrastructure, with Scorpions extending lines of relays toward the enemy that Scouts discover far from grid, under protection of Humanoids, to prepare a full attack on the enemy base.""]","by

The game uses live actors and sets as you control Sherlock Holmes and his longtime partner Dr. Watson, trying to solve three separate crimes by visiting various locations, listening to the dialogue, reading the included mock London newspapers, and, when one gets enough evidence, answering the judge\'s questions.\n Cases At the beginning of each case a full motion video clip depicts Holmes and Watson meeting a client and learning a few background clues about the case. Then the player must visit a particular location or person, read the London newspapers for clues or ask one of the young Baker Street Irregulars to investigate.

The unique features of the Nintendo DS improve upon the original with touch-screen controls, dual-screen layout, and wireless versus play with up to four players. The gameplay is fresh for returning players as multiple gods each with their own unique miracles have been added. All new play modes and areas appear, along with favorite classic maps from previous editions of Populous. In the beginning, there was nothing but a void, and from the void five gods created the world, each exercising their great power to shape the world with five different but brilliant colors. Earth created the basis for all things; Water soothed it; Fire imbrued it with vitality; Wind breathed into it freedom; Harvest provided it with nourishment. Fish, beasts, and finally beings called man came into existence. The power of the gods brought harmony among all living things and the world gave way to an age of glory. However, prosperity created darkness in the hearts of man, and from that darkness demons were birthed. The demons controlled the same five elements as the gods and rose against them. A chaotic battle for the world had begun. Thus opened the gates of an age of darkness, where man trembles in fear, helpless as the awesome powers rage around them. It marked the beginning of a long-lasting age that would test their faith between the gods and the demons.']","by

It's a total party atmosphere with thousands of uproarious questions, multiple fast-paced game variations, and an irreverent sense of humor. And with an Internet link, there's always an Outburst party for you to burst into. (Ages 17 and older)"", 'There have been few attempts to turn party word games into PC games, and probably for good reason. The games that currently exist such as Scrabble and Boggle do fine because there is a material component (a board or dice with letters) that acts as a visual cue to the gameplay. But when you try to dress up a word game like Outburst, which only uses cards with witty comments and a ""quirky"" host, you\'re bound to run into some stumbling blocks. <P>Outburst is a verbal party game where players divide into teams and try to guess phrases/words for a particular topic. For example, if the subject is ""Robert Redford films,"" answers like The Sting and The Natural are valid. However, the answers are preselected so that points are only gained for guessing the answers chosen by the game\'s creators. The game progresses through the various subjects, and each team tries to get more right answers than the other. <P>The trick to making computer versions of board games or party games work is the additional effort you put into the product. With Outburst, Hasbro added some extra flash to the game, but it\'s such a rip-off of the great You Don\'t Know Jack series that half the time you\'ll be thinking the game was made by Berkeley Systems. The announcer has that quirky tone. There are fake commercials between categories that offer outlandish and sometimes disgusting products and even animated icons (goofy exclamation points) to represent each team. <P>As for the questions, they\'re straight from the game. However, guessing answers is a legitimate strategy because the game only requires the first three letters for an entire answer to be correct. The topics range from the basic ""Animals of the Cat Family"" to the quirky ""Movies Featuring Airplanes"" or the moronic ""Foods That Create Intestinal Gas."" The variations in topics are numerous, but often you\'ll find yourself a little bored with the repetitive play that this game offers. <P>It\'s not a bad game, but it\'s not a good game either. This is a case of an interesting party game losing its magic when there\'s no party around. Unless you\'re desperate for a version of Outburst! you can play by yourself, you\'re better off sticking with other trivia and word puzzle games. <I>--Tahsin Shamma </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Along with 31 NBA teams and players from the 2001-2002 season, the game offers four modes of play: Quick Play, Arcade Play, NBA Season Play, and Skills Mode. Over 2,000 motion-captured moves have been included for realism. Quick Play is equivalent to an exhibition match, a single game pitting two teams against each other, while NBA Season Play involves guiding a team through an adjustable schedule of 13/14, 28, 56, or 82 games. An optional Fantasy Draft allows players to pick the athletes they want on their team(s) from the complete pool of NBA talent. Arcade Play takes a page from NBA Jam, as two teams play an exaggerated game of three-on-three hoops from a rooftop court. Hot Spots randomly appear for a chance to score extra points if the shot is made while standing on them. Skills Mode consists of two events: a standard 3-point contest and a practice mode to brush up on moves. Unique to NBA Courtside 2002 is an Adrenaline Meter used to boost a player&apos;s speed, perform special dribbles or dunks, and improve his chances of blocking a shot or stealing the ball. Different moves are available by pressing the button in different increments, so lightly tapping Adrenaline could result in a quick juke instead of a strong charge. A Create-Player option is also present, allowing players to disperse 260 points among such areas as stamina and 3-point shooting. Additional points are earned after playing games. Management options include trades, signing free agents, and modifying starting lineups. Three levels of difficulty are available, and complete stats and season progress can be saved to memory card.']",Left Field Productions,"['>#37,007 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#786 in Video Games > More Systems > GameCube']",$23.44,Video Games,B00008KTWM

Boss Rally - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Despite the title, this arcade racer from SouthPeak Interactive doesn't feature the very cool Boss Mustang in its lineup of cars. In fact, you won't find any authentic vehicles at all, and the six courses on which you race are fictitious, too. But it isn't a lack of realism that steers Boss Rally into the mediocrity zone; that's taken care of by shallow gameplay, touchy controls, nonexistent AI routines for computer drivers, and the absence of support for Internet play. <P> The frustration begins when you decide to run a few Quick Races to get used to the courses and cars - only to discover you're limited to a rather miserly two cars and two courses until you earn enough points after two races in championship mode. With only six courses in all (twelve if you count the reverse versions of each), Boss Rally developer Boss Game Studios and SouthPeak probably felt the only way to keep things interesting for a while was to parcel the courses out. My opinion? If you've got so little to offer in the way of courses, you might as well cough 'em up at the start instead of making them so elusive that some players will get bored or frustrated before they finally gain access to them. <P> OK, so you just go out and place high enough in those two events and gain access to more tracks and cars, right? Well, it's not quite that simple, thanks to some extremely touchy controls. Now I know that there's a lot of powersliding and fishtailing going on in real-life rallies. But I've played a whole lot of racing sims over the past couple of years (including 1997's underrated Rally Championship), and I've never had this much trouble making a car go where I wanted it to. For games like Sports Car GT, Grand Prix Legends, and Viper Racing, my Microsoft Force Feedback Wheel is an invaluable asset that adds greatly to the overall ambience of the experience; using that same wheel in Boss Rally, I found it a major struggle just to keep steady on a straightaway. <P> I had a lot more success with my Microsoft SideWinder Pro, especially since I found myself racing on the same two courses day after day. But by the time I'd gotten good enough to have a realistic shot at moving on to some new courses I was pretty much sick of playing. Part of the reason was clearly out-and-out frustration. Even though I went from 20th to 4th place in those two races (in just three laps), that's apparently not good enough to let me see the few other tidbits this game has to offer (and there's no way to change the difficulty settings, either). But another reason for my growing apathy is that you don't really race against 19 computer-controlled opponents, but against the clock. Sure, you always race against the clock in rallies, but the opponents in Boss Rally are basically nothing more than slot cars set to a timer: Not only do you pass vehicles like they're standing still, but you also do it in precisely the same spots on the course over and over again. Being a dedicated reviewer, I did hunt down a cheat to let me check out the game's full lineup of tracks and cars (thanks Paradigm!). But all it did was convince me that I'd stand even less of a chance in faster cars on tougher courses with snow, rain, or fog adding to the difficulty factor. <P> A good multiplayer game would alleviate a lot of those issues because you'd at least know you'd finished faster than other drivers rather than just beating some mysterious time benchmark - but the lack of Internet play means you'll either have to play on a LAN or find another Boss Rally owner for a dial-up or serial connection. What makes the absence of Internet play kind of odd is that cars in rallies leave the start line in one-minute intervals, and results are determined by total time, which means the hurdles of latency and packet loss should be pretty minimal. <P> There are definitely some things to like about Boss Rally. Just slinging the cars around the courses is fun for a while, and I got a kick out of being able to paint the cars (although your modifications show up on other cars as well as your own). But even with a budget sticker price, Boss Rally just doesn't have what it takes to satisfy over the long haul.<i>--Stephen Poole</i> <BR>--<I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

This portable game allows players to work their way through a world that they could normally only daydream about. This role playing game allows players to participate in the management and maintenance of a pet resort that caters to cats, dogs, rabbits, and horses. As the player moves through this system, they will learn to take care of each individual animal. For example, players will need to discover how to properly groom and exercise their horses as well as play with the cats and dogs. As the player advances through the game, they will need to take the profits they make through their business and reinvest them to make the resort more enjoyable for the animal guests and to bring further developments to the property. Like most role playing games, PAWS &amp; CLAWS PET RESORT requires some investment on the part of the player to insure that their gaming experience leads to a well-developed and enjoyable world that they will want to return to again and again. So, for those players who always wanted to work with animals but couldn't afford to, PAWS &amp; CLAWS PET RESORT will take them into that world, immerse them in it, and give them a break from the everyday reality that so many crave.""]",THQ,"['>#80,978 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#915 in Video Games &gt; More Systems &gt; Game Boy Advance &gt; Games']",$8.00,Video Games,B000ELQSTW
