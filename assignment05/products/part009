Features such as video chat, internet access, digital photo viewing, and digital audio and video will likely make it the central component of your media set-up. Still, it is first and foremost a game console--a powerful one at that.', '<b>Under the Hood</b><br> The PS3 features IBM\'s ""Cell"" processor and a co-developed Nvidia graphics processor that makes the system able to perform two trillion calculations per second. That\'s approximately 320 times more calculations per second than the PS2. Along with the traditional AV and composite connections, it also boasts an HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) port, which delivers uncompressed, unconverted digital picture and sound to compatible high-definition TV and projectors. The system is capable of 128-bit pixel precision and 1080p resolution for a full HD experience.', ""<b>Blu-Ray Is the New Way</b><br> Sony's PlayStation 3 games are encoded onto the Blu-Ray disc media format, which can hold six times as much data as traditional DVDs. This increase in capacity, combined with the awesome power of its processor and graphics card, promises mind-blowing games once developers have learned how to fully harness the new console's power. The PS3 will also support CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD+R formats."", ""<b>Sensational Controller</b><br> New gamers intuitively move the controller while playing, even though that movement has traditionally had no relation to what's going on in the game. Sony has picked up on this tendency and is using it to bring a new level of control to the PS3. Inside the controller is a high-precision six-axis sensing system that accurately detects fine movements in pitch, roll, and yaw, as well as three dimensions of movement. This means that future PS3 games will be controlled by the movements of your hands rather than just your thumbs. For example, you might be able to steer a car by holding the controller like a steering wheel."", ""While the PS3 controller looks much like its Dual Shock predecessors, it will lack the force-feedback vibration since that would only interfere with the sensing system. It uses Bluetooth 2.0 wireless technology and can support up to seven wireless controllers at a time. It's a hot-swappable system, so if your controller is running low on power, just pause your game and connect a USB 2.0 cable. You can continue playing while your controller recharges automatically."", ""<b>Backwards Compatible</b><br> The PlayStation 3 will be backward compatible with most PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games, which means you'll be able to play your favorite games without keeping all the old systems. The console will have slots for Memory Stick Duo, an SD slot and a Compact Flash memory slot. It comes with a pre-installed hard disc drive, which allows you to save games as well as download content from the internet."", '<b>A Slew of New Games</b><br> A whole host of game publishers are already backing the PS3 and several have even confirmed games for the console. At the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), more than 30 titles were displayed for the system, including <i>Gran Turismo HD</i>, <i>Resistance: Fall of Man</i>, and <i>Final Fantasy XIII</i>. Previously announced titles include <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i>, <i>Devil May Cry 4</i> and <i>Tekken 6</i>.', '<b>Online</b><br>Sony has stated that the PS3 will have similar online connectivity and services as the next generation of Xbox Live. Calling it ""an always on, always connected device,"" SCEI\'s chief technical officer Masa Chatani said the PS3 would be constantly in touch with a ""PlayStation World"" network ""fundamentally based on community, communication commerce, and content.""

To enhance the experience of driving the open race cars we have developed a helmet camera as never seen before. Not only does it accurately resemble the view from inside a helmet, it also has all the visor dynamics the real fan could wish for. The visor gets dirty and can be cleaned by pulling off a protective layer of plastic, the so called Tear-off. This all contributes to a unique experience. <li><b>True to life damage</b><br> A new damage system have been created for RACE 07, this is done to also support the formula class and Radical cars, the new damage model features detachable wheels, nose sections, engine covers, even wings are independently detachable upon impact. <li><b>32 Different tracks and variations from all over the world, including city tracks</b><br> RACE 07 features 32 tracks from all over the world, closely modeled after their real-live examples. Next to the famous real life racetracks RACE 07 also feature several city tracks for even more intense action. Several tracks are exclusively represented in RACE 07 and are not featured in any other motorsports games. <li><b>Enhanced track dynamics</b><br> With RACE 07 all tracks comes with a strengthened attention to details. Focus has been on trying to recreate the atmosphere surrounding real life racing and race tracks. 3D audience and more than double the amount of track side objects are just a few of the steps taken to improve the immersion of actually being on one of the real life race tracks included in the game. <li><b>Car filter</b><br> RACE 07 features a car filter that allows you to mix cars and classes as you please. Use the car filter to create single make racing or mix formula cars, sports cars and touring cars. <li><b>Human-like AI opponents that will force you into an error.</b><br> The AI in RACE 07 is better than ever. They behave as natural, trying to force you into an error, putting the pressure on by making moves and stressing you by flashing their headlights. You\'ll have a hard time defending from these fanatics; the strength/aggression of the opponents can also be adjusted in the game! <li><b>Online artificial intelligence</b><br> RACE 07 includes online AI which means that you can fill up the field of cars on a server with computer generated opponents. This feature assures a challenging online experience, even if you are just a few people logged into the server. <li><b>Enhanced community appeal; community drivers, customized skins and league-support</b><br> RACE 07 has everything racing-communities could wish for. Not only are the loyal fans of SimBin racing games already represented in the game through their names on various cars, they will also be able to host leagues and use their own car skins in the game, creating the ultimate individual championships. <li><b>The two-race-format</b><br> RACE 07 truthfully recreates the WTCC all the way to the two-race format of the real WTCC races. The top eight finishers in the first race will switch places on the grid for the second race and the winner of the race session is the player who gathers the most combined points in the both races. <li><b>Bugs and dirt on window</b><br> A new version of the bug on window and dynamic weather effects system used in RACE is being introduced for RACE 07, this will also work on the helmet visor and will greatly enhance the immersion factor while playing the game. Functioning window wipers allow you to sweep away both rain and insects. <li><b>Dynamic weather effects</b><br> Dynamic water drops on helmet visor and windows are simulated in real-time to simulate the sensation of racing in wet or intermediate weather conditions, the liquids are also being affected by the wind speed. <li><b>Performance monitor</b><br> The performance monitor included with RACE 07 is designed to help the player find the best compromise between visual appearance and game performance, the player can set a target frame rate, once set the game will suggest the best suitable graphical settings after having monitored the games performance during a race session. <li><b>New controller interface</b><br> With the new controller interface much more attention is paid to the players wanting to drive the cars using a joy-pad, keyboard or utilize the mouse steering option. Added controller logics have been applied to make control of the cars with a joy-pad just as involving and satisfying as with a wheel.

Fisher is now a renegade operative digging into the events of the past and he doesn\'t like what he has found. His personal investigation into his daughter\'s death reveals that he\'s been betrayed by his former agency, the Third Echelon. The agency responds by pursuing him, but as he works to elude them he becomes aware of a deadly terrorist plot that threatens millions. He is uniquely positioned and prepared to act against this, but success is doubtful without the help of former friends from the Third Echelon team, resulting in a series of life and death situations for himself and the country where trust can by no means be assumed. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Tom Clancy\'s Splinter Cell: Conviction</i>, as with all games in the <i>Splinter Cell</i> series, is a tactical stealth-action game. In single player modes players take on the role of Sam Fisher and engage in a series of missions utilizing high-tech weaponry, gadgets, lethal hand-to-hand combat and interrogation skills. Overall objectives and the necessary steps to achieve them are challenging, yet always clear via dual verbal and visual expression that seamlessly alerts players as they progress through missions. In addition, <i>Conviction</i> enhances the world of stealth combat that has made the <i>Splinter Cell</i> franchise a runaway hit for years through a series of revolutionary new gameplay features. These include: <ul> <li><u>Mark and Execute</u> - A gameplay mechanism for eliminating several enemies at once, Mark and Execute allows players to ""Mark"" multiple enemies, or points in the surrounding environment for termination in batches. Once this is done, a close-combat kill is required, after which the player can activate the ""Execute"" portion of the mechanism to dispose of all enemies in a cinematic manner. A limited amount of Mark functionality is attached to players\' weapons, so this ability must be used wisely.</li> <li><u>Last Known Position</u> - Last Known Position is a visual representation of where the game\'s AI assumes you are, based on where you were last sighted. This provides players with a wide array of options, including setting traps for enemies, flanking maneuvers or simply disappearing while you are thought to be elsewhere.</li> <li><u>Experience System</u> - Successful completion of objectives via the Persistent Elite Creation System earns players rewards in the form of experience points.

In his thirst for revenge, the vile tyrant of an ancient race of foul insect-like monsters called Cragmites has festered an age-old grudge and is bent on wiping the last-known Lombax off the universe. As Tachyons forces ambush Ratchet and Clank in their home galaxy, our heroes realize they need to escape quickly to prevent its destruction. In a move of desperate irony, Ratchet and Clank steal Tachyons imperial warship and embark upon an adventure bigger than any theyve experienced- one that will not only unravel the mystery of the Lombaxes, but also test the very limits of their friendship. Insomniac Games has overhauled its proprietary PS3 engine technology to create the most visceral Ratchet & Clank universe yet, overflowing with exotic creatures and flying vehicles. Experience many more objects on screen and in more intricate detail than what was possible on PlayStation 2 Ratchet & Clank games. The PS3 systems superior power enables Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction to bring vivid worlds to life with increased draw distances, enhanced lighting and shadowing, and more fluid and exaggerated animations. Discover an all-new galaxy spanning vast worlds such as a majestic cloud city and a space-age amusement park. Encounter an entirely new cast of expressive characters (and some old favorites) as well as the introduction of a variety of new alien races and life forms. Experience a more emotive Ratchet with nearly as many animation joints in his face (90) as PS2 Ratchet had in his entire body (112). This joint density applies to many of the characters featured in Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, enabling more detailed, personable and expressive characters. Clank returns as a playable character, and Ratchet will have new enhanced abilities. Fire a fully stocked arsenal of all-new weapons such as the Plasma Beasts and Tornado Launcher, which uses the SIXAXIS[ controller to direct tornadoes that suck up enemies and whip them around with debris. Use the SIXAXIS controller to maneuver, destroy enemies and solve puzzles. Upgrade and customize weapons with a new system that provides greater power and flexibility. Players also will have the ability to upgrade Ratchets armor. Utilize Ratchets new supply of consumable on-demand combat devices, such as the Groovitron, which causes enemies to dance uncontrollably to 70s disco hits. Gadgets gameplay returns as Ratchet and Clank will have more gadgets at their disposal to help them bounce, fly, evade and defy gravity. Pilot Ratchets ship through asteroid fields while trying to destroy enemy fleets in a complete redesign of classic Ratchet & Clank space combat gameplay.']","by

But time is limited, so don\'t be late for the weigh-in!<p/><i>Cabela\'s Monster Bass</i> lets you test your skills on six of America\'s greatest fishing lakes, including Lake Wylie, Clear Lake, Lake of the Ozarks, Lake Amistad, Logan Martin Lake, and Lake Okeechobee. You\'ll fish for nine species of monster bass, such as large mouth, small mouth, spotted, striped and more. There are also 14 other trophy species, such as trout, salmon, northern pike, catfish and walleye. <p/>Casting the line is initiated by flicking the analog stick or -- for less patient players -- by inputting specific commands to attract fish. Once a fish starts biting, the fight begins. Following the on-screen visual cues, players must carefully balance reeling in the fish while keeping an eye on the line\'s tension so it doesn\'t break. Button combinations can also be used to weaken the fish\'s resolve, allowing for an easier catch. As players progress, additional rods, lures, and live bait become available to improve the odds of landing the ""big one."" Other play options include an Open Fishing mode and a Quick Challenge. The former has players fishing on their choice of lakes, while the latter involves racking up high scores in timed events.']","by

Surrounded by enemies and hostile nations, Conan&#146;s rule hangs by a thread and in the end, it&#146;s up to players, either singly or backed by their guilds to turn the tide for or against the embattled king.<p/><b>Massively Multiplayer Gaming for the Adult Player</b><br/> One of the most highly anticipated MMORPGs in recent years due to the strength and familiarity of the <i>Conan</i> franchise across a variety of major media, <i>Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures</i> is the first of several releases planned for the franchise, all of which are aimed at an adult audience. Firmly rooted in the savage, bloody, violent and sexy Hyborian universe, players can expect a graphically beautiful game blended with gritty gameplay that is true to both the barbarian hero from Howard&#146;s writings and the Schwarzenegger influenced version from books, movies and comics.<p/><b>Available Cultures and Classes</b><br/>Although <i>Age of Conan </i> contains a wide range of peoples, its playable cultures are currently limited to Aquilonians, Cimmerians, and Stygians. Within each of these players can choose from a selection of archetypal character classes, although available classes and subsequent subclasses are not necessarily the same within each culture. For example, archetypal classes for Aquilonians and Cimmerians are Rogue, Priest and Soldier, while Stygians are represented by Rogue, Priest and Mage. Further differences exist within subclasses for each. See the basic breakdown of all three cultures below:<p/><u>Aquilonians</u>: Internally divided, but united against their barbarian neighbors, the Aquilonians live lives on the edge. Their kingdom, with its prosperous cities, enlightened culture and religious freedom, is known as the ""Flower of the West."" Yet for all this and despite the power of King, Conan I, it is a land where culture clashes and unrest are always a threat.<p/><u>Cimmerians</u>: As the Hyborian Age comes to an end the northern barbarian clans of the Cimmerians know that the end of their time is drawing near too. King Conan I of Aquilonia is himself a Cimmerian, though not typical of his people. Although his life has been filled with wanderlust, his Kin care nothing for what occurs outside their clan territories.<p/><u>Stygians</u>: Masters of the magical arts and ruled by their consuming worship of the serpent-god Set, the Stygians excel at occult and diabolic lore. They learned long ago that true power lies in knowledge and in pacts with dark powers. This single-mindedness has allowed them become the only culture to harness the secrets of the Mage class and power that comes with it.<p/><b>Modes Singleplayer as well as Multiplayer</b><br/>Unlike most MMORPGs, <i>Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures</i> includes a significant singleplayer experience as well as deep overarching multiplayer gameplay. This is an atypical MMORPG feature, but one that has a purpose. Players enter the game as a lowly galley slave with no memory of his/her past, and over the first five to 20 levels of singleplayer action build the skills necessary to survive in the game\'s multiplayer levels. During this time you will traverse a variety of rich environments including jungles, deserts, mountains, valleys, dungeons and cities packed with NPCs, beasts and monsters, before eventually leveling up and moving back to your chosen culture&#146;s homeland. Because the only character-related choices that players have to make at the game&#146;s opening are their looks, clothing and culture, this singleplayer mode is important in deciding what class and subclass to pursue and thus the level of impact your character will have in greater multiplayer portions of the game.<p/>In-game levels 20 and above are strictly multiplayer. 20-40 introduce players to guilds. 40-60 deal with large scale combat. 60-80 have the player interacting with King Conan and levels 80 and up represent end-game play. Here gameplay changes as social aspects of MMORPG gameplay take over on a large scale.<p/><b>Real-time Combat That Takes Queues from the FPS</b><br/>Traditionally MMORPGs have utilized a mix of auto and turn-based functionality in their combat systems, but <i>Age of Conan</i> dispenses with that, instead drawing inspiration from FPS/action games. Firmly rooted in the brutality of the <i>Hyborian</i> universe, game developer Funcom has devised an action-based system that not only provides the sense of actually being in the fight, but also requires the player to participate in it. That means no simple targeted attacks. Players can attack and defend from nearly any position in real-time, whether on the ground or atop a mount, while standing still or on the move. It&#146;s a recipe for carnage and one that fits right into the world of Conan.<p/>The combat system in <i>Age of Conan</i> comes in three forms: drunken brawling, mini games like CTF and massive Player vs. Player battles, which lets you engage in siege combat to defend or attack a city. All are easy to learn, but difficult to master, providing hours worth of play and replay value and are the core of this new cutting edge MMORPG.<p/><b>Additional items included in the Collector\'s Edition </b><li><ul><li>Hand-finished, metal-embossed oversized collector\'s box with inlay page and individually numbered holographic sticker<li>Leather map of Hyboria (faux) 14"" x 20""<li>The Ring of Acheronia (exclusive in-game item)<li>Unique Bonus DVD featuring trailers, behind the scenes, developer diaries, and rich artwork<li>Official <i>Age of Conan</i> soundtrack CD<li>Art Book (128 pages)<li>Five free guest passes giving friends online access to the game for a limited time<li>The Drinking Cape (bonus in-game item)</ul><h4>System Requirements:</h4><center><table border=1 cellpadding=""3"" width=50%><tr><td></td><td align=center><b>Minimum Specifications:</b></td><td align=center><b>Recommended Specifications:</b></td><tr><td>OS:</td><td colspan=2 align=center>Windows XP Service Pack 2 or Windows Vista</td></tr><tr><td>Processor:</td><td align=center>Intel Pentium 4 3Ghz or equivalent</td><td align=center>Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz or equivalent</td></tr><tr><td>RAM:</td><td align=center>1GB</td><td align=center>2048MB Dual Channel DDR2</td></tr><tr><td>Video Card:</td><td align=center>NVIDIA GeForce 6600 or better</td><td align=center>NVIDIA GeForce 7900 GTX or equivalent</td></tr><tr><td>Video Memory:</td><td align=center>128MB</td><td align=center>512MB</td></tr><tr><td>DVD-ROM:</td><td colspan=2 align=center>Quad-speed (4x) DVD-ROM drive</td></tr><tr><td>Hard Drive Space:</td><td colspan=2 align=center>30GB of Free Space</td></tr><tr><td>Other:</td><td colspan=2 align=center>Broadband connection required for online gameplay</td></tr></table></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>']","by

Your center of balance, the point between your left and right sides when you stand upright, has a lot to do with your health. Those without an even center of balance will be unnaturally compensating for this imbalance, which causes their posture to become misaligned, increasing the possibility of putting unnecessary strain on their bodies. This is where the Wii Balance Board comes in.<p/>Similar in appearance to a step aerobics board, the Wii Balance Board is much, much more. Easily capable of supporting weights up to a maximum of 300 pounds, it is sturdy and precise, able to measure weight and register pressure accurately when placed on a variety of flat surfaces. This advanced level of sensitivity allows for both the wide range of activities found in the <i>Wii Fit</i> software as well as the board\'s amazing ability recognize individual players by their weight alone.<p/><b>Getting Started: Create a Profile</b><br/>Before you jump into doing exercises and activities, you&#146;ll start by creating a profile. This is done easily and intuitively by simply choosing a Mii, entering your height and age information, and doing a few quick tests that will serve as a baseline for your new Wii fitness regimen. These tests are:<ul><li><u>BMI Check</u>: BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that is the standard used by agencies such as the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Health. To check your BMI, you&#146;ll enter your height then stand on the Wii Balance Board and let it read your weight.<li><u>Wii Fit Age</u>: After you&#146;ve checked your BMI, you&#146;ll do a basic balance test and find out your current <i>Wii Fit</i> Age. This basic balance test measures how well you can control your left and right balance. Based on the results, you&#146;ll be assigned a Wii Fit Age.</ul><p/><b>Four Categories of Fun</b><br/>Once you have created your profile it\'s time to have some fun. <i>Wii Fit</i> features four main categories of exercises to choose from: Strength Training, Aerobics, Yoga and Balance Games. <i>Wii Fit</i> will guide you through the first three with the help of your own virtual personal trainer, while the balance games offer variety and fun to help keep you engaged and excited about your fitness goals. In addition, as you spend time exercising, you&#146;ll earn <i>Fit</i> Credits that unlock additional exercises and activities within your favorite categories that will allow you to continue to push yourself. See more detail on the four categories below: <ul><li><u>Strength Training</u>: Put your strength to the test with muscle-toning exercises like Single Leg Extension, Sideways Leg Lift, Arm and Leg Lift, Single-Arm Stand, Torso Twists, Rowing Squat, Single Leg Twist, Lunge, Push-Up and Side Plank, Jackknife, Plank and Tricep Extension. Challenges include Push-Up Challenge, Plank Challenge and Jackknife Challenge.<li><u>Aerobics</u>: Get your heart pumping with fun, interactive Aerobic exercises like Hula Hoop, Basic Step, Basic Run, Super Hula Hoop, Advanced Step, 2-P Run, Rhythm Boxing, Free Step and Free Run.<li><u>Yoga</u>: Work on your balance and flexibility with Yoga poses and activities like Deep Breathing, Half-Moon, Dance, Cobra, Bridge, Spinal Twist, Shoulder Stand, Warrior, Tree, Sun Salutation, Standing Knee, Palm Tree, Chair, Triangle and Downward-Facing Dog.<li><u>Balance Games</u>: Get into the action with fun, balanced-based games like Soccer Heading, Ski Slalom, Ski Jump, Table Tilt, Tightrope Walk, Balance Bubble, Penguin Slide, Snowboard Slalom and Lotus Focus.</ul><p/><b>Keep Track of Your Progress</b><br/>Because keeping fit is an ongoing process, <i>Wii Fit</i> also tracks the activities you do the most and puts them into your Favorites category. With this information players can note exercises and activities that they are strong in, as well as others that may need to improve at. Some of the ways players can use this information for are to: <ul><li>Keep tabs on your daily progress with easy-to-understand graphs and charts. Using your personal profile, you can set goals, view a graph of your BMI results over time, see how many Fit Credits you&#146;ve earned, check your <i>Wii Fit</i> Age and even enter exercise time you&#146;ve done outside of <i>Wii Fit</i>. It&#146;s all about coming back and exercising a little every day, and the personal profile makes tracking your daily progress simple and easy.<li>Quickly check your <i>Wii Fit Age</i> and BMI without even putting the game in the console by going directly to the <i>Wii Fit</i> Channel.<li>Allow up to eight family members can create their own profiles in <i>Wii Fit</i>. On the profile-selection screen, everyone in the family can see each other&#146;s recent BMI progress and Fit Credit total. This will allow families to have a friendly competition to exercise and get fit.</ul>Variety, fun and progress tracking; <i>Wii Fit</i> has it all. So, Wii owners if you ready to reclaim your balance and get fit all you need is <i>Wii Fit</i>, a few minutes a day to play and the urge to have fun. Get on board today.']","by

Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.', 'Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.', 'The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.', ""High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King."", ""<strong>A Multitude of Monsters</strong><br /> Strange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world."", ""Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations. Cobbled together from the pieces of giant body parts, the Flesh Giants employ tremendous strength to carry out the Lich King's wishes."", ""The World of Warcraft: Wrath of King Lich expansion pack allows you to engage in epic siege warfare. The pack presents the first Hero class and allows you to transform your Death Knight's look with character customization that even include hairstyles and dances.

By utilizing the most powerful PS/2 buffer-system ever created for a gaming keyboard, SteelSeries 7G redefines ""anti-ghosting"" by supporting as many simultaneous key presses as there are keys on the keyboard. The keyboard features both PS/2 and USB connectors. The use of PS/2 combined with a gold-plated USB connector and 18K gold-plated mechanical switches, means that SteelSeries 7G improves your ability to obtain more Actions Per Minute than any other keyboard in the world. It features gaming grade response times and more than six times the durability of a traditional keyboard.', '<div class=""aplus"" >', 'SteelSeries 7G sets new industry standards for gaming keyboards by allowing users to perform the most detailed and advanced key combinations to date. By utilizing the most powerful PS/2 buffer-system ever created for a gaming keyboard, SteelSeries 7G redefines ""anti-ghosting"" by supporting as many simultaneous key presses as there are keys on the keyboard. The keyboard features both PS/2 and USB connectors.', 'The use of PS/2 combined with a gold-plated USB connector and 18K gold-plated mechanical switches, means that SteelSeries 7G improves your ability to obtain more Actions Per Minute than any other keyboard in the world. It features gaming grade response times and more than 6 times the durability of a traditional keyboard.', 'To put it simply: If you need the fastest reaction time, highest reliability, and the ability to perform very complex keyboard combinations, then the SteelSeries 7G is your choice.', 'Ever tried pressing a few keys on your keyboard and getting a beep sound? It either happens when you press too many keys at the same time, or when you press too many keys within the same cluster at the same time (like the keys around WASD which often used for movements in games). If your keyboard exhibits this behavior it will hinder your ability to perform certain actions, movement in FPS games being one example. The industry calls this anti-ghosting. When using USB, you can use up to 6 keys plus modifiers at the same time, which is the highest spec limit a USB connection can accommodate.', 'It gets even better. With the 7G you don&#8217;t have to press the keys all the way down for them to register. The mechanical switches will register key presses quickly with a travel distance roughly 50% shorter than a conventional keyboard. You will type faster, with a consistent tactile feeling. Your Actions Per Minute (APM) can reach new heights with the 7G thanks to this feature.', 'But the 7G offers more than just a long lifecycle. The rubber domes on a conventional keyboard will, over time, lose their tactile feeling due to rubber flexing. The keys you use the most will start to feel different. The physical construction of the mechanical switches used in the 7G, and the strict tolerance levels in which the switches are manufactured, is what allows the key presses on this keyboard to always feel consistent.', 'SteelSeries 7G is equipped with audio ports for headphone-in and microphone-out and features two USB 1.1 ports, making it easier than ever to connect speakers or a headset to your setup. Headphone/speaker-out and microphone-in is built directly into the keyboard. This gives you easy access to your audio outlet, instead of having to move to the back of your computer, when changing or plugging in audio devices. Not to mention plugging in your mouse or recharging your MP3-player or cell phone is closer and easier.', 'It may take a while to get used to a mechanical keyboard. Most gamers or typists acclimate in approximately 1 to 2 weeks. Once you are properly acclimated you will appreciate better tactile feedback, superior response times and ultimately greater control. Simply put: You will become a better typist.', 'It\'s not just called ""heavyweight"" because it packs the best performance in the industry. The 7G is also physically heavy. All keys are mounted on a metal plate within the keyboard to ensure durability. The plastic material used to create the keyboard has metal elements, also to help to improve durability.', 'The PS/2 connector will give you total freedom with no limit to the amount of simultaneous key presses. And, equally as important, using the PS/2 may just improve your overall gaming experience. The reason is that when you use a USB keyboard your computer is actually using CPU time polling your keyboard. The higher the polling rate the more CPU time is used to perform the polling. And because of the built-in debounce rate found on any quality keyboard, any polling rate above 200Hz is simply a waste of CPU time and really just a result of pointless marketing hype. Unlike USB keyboards, a PS/2 keyboard isn&#8217;t polled at all. The keyboard simply sends a signal to the computer as key presses are made, which causes a hardware interrupt, forcing the CPU to register the signal.', 'The 7G is built with a USB as standard, but also included is a USB to PS/2 adapter in the box. The choice is yours.', ""The Windows key is useful for certain things and in certain situations. But not in the middle of a gaming session. Replacing it on the 7G is a SteelSeries Key that won&#8217;t wreak havoc during a gaming session by minimizing your game or by opening a menu. The SteelSeries Key serves a different purpose: it's a function key for the Media Controls found on the 7G. You can press the SteelSeries key and access the Media Controls via the first six F-keys on the keyboard."", 'The SteelSeries 7G Mechanical Keyboard, handrest, USB connector, USB to PS/2 adapter.', '<i>""...the build quality of the 7G is nothing short of exceptional.

Broken down into five distinct open-world gameplay areas, linked on the game map, cumulatively these areas comprise a massive area, much larger than anything ever seen in previous <i>Midnight Club</i> releases and possibly larger than any existing racer to date. Within these areas, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Mulholland Drive and Downtown LA, players are free to engage in mission play driving them to attain and customize a wide range of authentic world-class street racing vehicles, or to simply explore the city, taking on all comers in a variety of race types as they wish. Regardless, along the way they will experience not only the visual realism of the iconic boulevards, freeways, and landmarks made famous in TV and movies, but also the realism of the living breathing LA urban experience. Here traffic backs up then clears as people go to and leave work for the day, weather systems come and go and day turns to night, then back again. All the while the race goes on. It\'s all part of the living, breathing LA. It\'s all part of the <i>Midnight Club</i>. <p/> <b>The Cars</b><br/> <i>Midnight Club: Los Angeles</i> will feature an astounding selection of vehicles in the Muscle Car, Exotics, Tuners, Motorcycle and Luxury car categories. At the time of publishing only a fraction of the total list has been announced, but a good sampling of what players can expect at launch can be seen below.

The hottest licensed cars and bikes in the world are at your disposal - kit them out, supe them up, and personalize them down to the last detail to make them all your own. Visit <i>the Club\'s</i> in-game garages located in Hollywood and Santa Monica and let your imagination run wild - tweaking and fine tuning through the following three different types of vehicle modifications: <p/><u>Performance &amp; Handling</u> - To become a street legend, you\'re going to have to tune your vehicle for maximum performance. The garage offers three levels of upgrades for virtually every component on your vehicle, but it\'s up to you to craft the winning combination that will give you the edge on the competition.<p/><u>Exterior</u> - For the Midnight Club, stunting is a habit and its clandestine Los Angeles garages have all the toys needed to ensure heads turn in this jaded town. From making sure your car is dripping in candy paint, to adding unique body kits and jaw dropping extras, the garage offers practically limitless possibilities to personalize your vehicle with aftermarket accessories and customizable options. <p/><u>Interior</u> - Don\'t embarrass yourself by pulling up with an outrageously kitted-up car that has a \'me-too\' factory interior. Not a good look! You\'re going to be spending a lot of time behind the wheel, so renovate and make yourself feel comfortable. <p/> <b>Beware or Befriend the Local Competition</b><br/> The street racing scene of <i>Midnight Club</i> is tough, but tight, meaning that everyone that you meet in expansive <i>Los Angeles</i> could just as easily be an ally as an enemy. One thing is for certain though, they are all willing to throw down at the drop of a hat. Just a few of the faces you\'ll encounter out on the streets are:<br/> <TABLE border=""0"" cellpadding=""5""> <TD width=""79""><img valign=""top"" alt=""NPC Karol from \'Midnight Club: Los Angeles\'"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mcla.karol.75.jpg"" width=""75"" height=""75"" align=""top"" hspace=""0"" vspace=""0""> </TD> <TD width=""850"" valign=""top""><u>Karol, Age 45</u> - A veteran of Moscow\'s underground street racing circuit, Karol moved to LA in the 1990\'s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. If you\'re looking for cars, he\'s your man. He owns two successful garages and claims to be able to get hold of any vehicle, no questions asked. He also sees himself as a philosopher and will bend your ear if you left him. He mostly races around Hollywood and the Beaches and his rides include a 1975 Datsun 280Z, 1969 Boss Mustang 302, 2006 Dodge Challenger and a 1971 Lamborghini Miura SV. </TD> <TR> <TD width=""79""><img valign=""top"" alt=""NPC Annie from \'Midnight Club: Los Angeles\'"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mcla.annie.75.jpg"" width=""75"" height=""75"" vspace=""5"" hspace=""0"" align=""texttop""> </TD> <TD width=""850"" valign=""top""><u>Annie, Age 31</u> - Annie has a rep as one of the fiercest drivers in the city. She detests posers and wannabes, is intelligent and sharp-tongued and pulls no punches when it comes to cutting the competition down to size. She has been spotted in everything from a 1983 VW Golf GTI, 2006 Pontiac Solstice, 2008 Chrysler 300C SRT-8, 2008 Audi RS4 and a 2004 Ford Shelby Cobra Concept and can usually be found hanging out near Pink\'s Hotdog Stand in Hollywood along with her crew.</TD> </TR> </table> <b>Rockstar Games Social Club: Join the Community</b><br/> Being a Rockstar game <i>Midnight Club: Los Angeles</i> comes with a huge commitment to the gaming community.

Broken down into five distinct open-world gameplay areas, linked on the game map, cumulatively these areas comprise a massive area, much larger than anything ever seen in previous <i>Midnight Club</i> releases and possibly larger than any existing racer to date. Within these areas, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Mulholland Drive and Downtown LA, players are free to engage in mission play driving them to attain and customize a wide range of authentic world-class street racing vehicles, or to simply explore the city, taking on all comers in a variety of race types as they wish. Regardless, along the way they will experience not only the visual realism of the iconic boulevards, freeways, and landmarks made famous in TV and movies, but also the realism of the living breathing LA urban experience. Here traffic backs up then clears as people go to and leave work for the day, weather systems come and go and day turns to night, then back again. All the while the race goes on. It\'s all part of the living, breathing LA. It\'s all part of the <i>Midnight Club</i>. <p/> <b>The Cars</b><br/> <i>Midnight Club: Los Angeles</i> will feature an astounding selection of vehicles in the Muscle Car, Exotics, Tuners, Motorcycle and Luxury car categories.

The hottest licensed cars and bikes in the world are at your disposal - kit them out, supe them up, and personalize them down to the last detail to make them all your own. Visit <i>the Club\'s</i> in-game garages located in Hollywood and Santa Monica and let your imagination run wild - tweaking and fine tuning through the following three different types of vehicle modifications: <p/><u>Performance &amp; Handling</u> - To become a street legend, you\'re going to have to tune your vehicle for maximum performance. The garage offers three levels of upgrades for virtually every component on your vehicle, but it\'s up to you to craft the winning combination that will give you the edge on the competition.<p/><u>Exterior</u> - For the Midnight Club, stunting is a habit and its clandestine Los Angeles garages have all the toys needed to ensure heads turn in this jaded town. From making sure your car is dripping in candy paint, to adding unique body kits and jaw dropping extras, the garage offers practically limitless possibilities to personalize your vehicle with aftermarket accessories and customizable options. <p/><u>Interior</u> - Don\'t embarrass yourself by pulling up with an outrageously kitted-up car that has a \'me-too\' factory interior. Not a good look! You\'re going to be spending a lot of time behind the wheel, so renovate and make yourself feel comfortable. <p/> <b>Beware or Befriend the Local Competition</b><br/> The street racing scene of <i>Midnight Club</i> is tough, but tight, meaning that everyone that you meet in expansive <i>Los Angeles</i> could just as easily be an ally as an enemy. One thing is for certain though, they are all willing to throw down at the drop of a hat.

With the massive economic boom it receives, Russia quickly re-establishes itself as a superpower and restores her military might. In response most of Western Europe unifies to create the European Federation, a new nation destined to be a formidable 21st-century superpower. But things are also changing across the pond. In 2020, the United States is on the verge of finishing construction on the Freedom Star, a controversial orbital military platform that will upset the balance of world power.

While it had a solid offering of its own games, the 7800 featured a prime system feature: full, built-in compatibility with the Atari 2600. While consoles of the past could play Atari 2600 games through the use of an optional adapter, the 7800 accepted these cartridges right in the main slot and played them without any extra add-ons.  The Atari 7800 was originally designed to succeed the Atari 5200 in 1984, but the system\'s launch was shelved when Atari was sold to new owners who wanted to focus on the computer market instead. The console was, instead, officially launched two years later in response to Nintendo and SEGA entering the US home console market with the Nintendo Entertainment System and Master System respectively. Many of the console\'s planned features, such as a high score saving cartridge, were never released.  With the 7800 launch, Atari put a focus on ""budget"" gaming, with many games selling for less than $19.99. Because the system was all ready to go back in 1984, most of the launch titles were arcade titles from several years prior. The system was very capable in visuals as seen in games like the bundled Pole Position II. But its sound system lacked: the system designers created a cheap sound chip that could be included in cartridges, but to keep costs low, Atari limited the sound chip in very few titles. With Nintendo locking up third-parties with its two-year exclusivity agreement, Atari also had a hard time convincing third-party companies to produce games for its console  as a result, the company went after the rights to popular games that were available only for computers.  Its delayed release, its cancelled peripherals, and a lack of financial backing from the company\'s new owners all combined to ensure that Atari 7800 would never see any success beyond being a sexier way of playing Atari 2600 titles.']","by

The two superpowers are now locked in a costly and controversial military space race. This rivalry builds to a crescendo when the U.S. prepares to launch the Freedom Star, a huge military space station that Europe suspects could be used to neutralize its missile shield satellites. An evolution of today\'s Marine Expeditionary Units, the Joint Strike Force is known for their integration of air and ground combat capabilities. Epitomizing the saying, \'high speed, low drag,\' these elite soldiers excel in precision firepower and can rapidly deploy anywhere in the world. Moreover, their stealth technology and the accuracy of their weapons are second-to-none.<p/><table width=""75"" cellpadding=""5"" align=""left""><tr><td align=""center""><img alt=""The Russian Spetsnaz Guard Brigade insignia from \'Tom Clancy\'s EndWar\'"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/EW.rsgb.75.jpg"" border=""0""></td></tr></table><b>The Russian Spetsnaz Guard Brigades</b><br/>The world\'s number one supplier of oil and natural gas since the 2016 nuclear war in the Middle East, Russia has experienced an economic boom of epic proportions. It has used its newfound riches to build up its military to levels beyond the Cold War and is once again a true superpower in the world arena. Soldier for soldier, no force on the planet can match the Spetsnaz Guard Brigades in terms of raw, brute force. Hardened veterans of Russia\'s many regional conflicts, these troopers are a highly effective, determined, and deadly force. The Spetsnaz tend to focus on heavy weapons and heavy armor, and often ingeniously modify standard-issue equipment to suit their needs, resulting in vehicles bristling with bolted-on weaponry the original designer never dreamed of including.<p/><b>Key Game Features</b>:<ul><li>Experience a chillingly realistic vision of World War III in the fashion of the best techno-thrillers.</li><li>Explore 40 stunningly realistic real-world battlefields set in Europe and the United States, including Washington D.C., Paris, and Moscow.</li><li>Deeply customizable armies featuring unit ranks and hundreds of upgrades add up to endless replay value.</li><li>Go to war online in a persistent multiplayer campaign with fully-customizable battalions and units.</li><li>Watch the destruction unfold in spectacular detail in massive battles featuring hundreds of units and fully destructible environments.</li></ul><b>Join in a Battle Armed for the Future</b><br/>Instead of the traditional top-down view, <i>EndWar</i> uses a unique third-person camera that puts you in the heart of the battle. This means that you get a bird&#146;s-eye view of the devastation that unfold as hundreds of units engage the enemy on fully destructible battlefields. Also, true to the Tom Clancy legacy, <i>EndWar</i> deals with fictional, but strikingly true to life situations and scenarios and features a wide range of vehicles, weapons, and equipment based on real-world military research. The result is a frighteningly realistic and relevant war-game experience that provides players with unprecedented access to the cutting-edge technology of tomorrow&#146;s wars and the combatants that may faceoff in them.<p/>']","by

Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It&rsquo;s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off. <p/> <b>Action Combat</b><br/> <i>Br&uuml;tal Legend</i>&rsquo;s core gameplay is classic action slasher, but with a twist: ranged combat comes from your demon-slaying, electricity-creating guitar. Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual. <p/> <b>A Streaming Open World</b><br/> <i>Br&uuml;tal Legend</i> gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of <i>Br&uuml;tal Legend</i> looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting. <p/> <b>Packed with Cameos and Voice Talent</b><br/> <i>Br&uuml;tal Legend</i> is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970&rsquo;s classic metal to 1980&rsquo;s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990&rsquo;s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity. <p/> <b>Multiplayer Mayhem</b><br/> 4v4 ""skirmish"" multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. <i>Br&uuml;tal Legend</i>&rsquo;s multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online via Xbox LIVE (broadband connection required for online play). <p/> <b>Soundtrack</b><br/> The soundtrack of <i>Br&uuml;tal Legend</i> is truly massive. Made up of 108 of the most rocking tracks from 75 different bands representing every sub-genre of metal, it is something to experience in and of itself. The complete track list includes: <p/> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""2""> <tr> <td valign=""top""> <ul> <li>""A Serpentine Crave"" - Bishop of Hexen</li> <li>""Ad Notics"" - Rotting Christ</li> <li>""Am I Evil?"" - Diamond Head</li> <li>""Angel Witch"" - Angel Witch</li> <li>""Angels Don\'t Kill"" - Children of Bodom</li> <li>""Assault Attack"" - Michael Schenker Group</li> <li>""Back at the Funny Farm"" - Mot&ouml;rhead</li> <li>""Battle Angels"" - Sanctuary</li> <li>""Battle Hymn"" - Judas Priest</li> <li>""Believer"" - Ozzy Osbourne</li> <li>""Betrayal"" - Lita Ford</li> <li>""Birth of the Hero"" - Tvangeste</li> <li>""Blackout"" - Scorpions</li> <li>""Blitzkrieg"" - Deathstars</li> <li>""Bomber"" - Girlschool</li> <li>""Breadfan"" - Budgie</li> <li>""Cathode Ray Sunshine"" - Dark Tranquillity</li> <li>""Children of the Grave"" - Black Sabbath</li> <li>""Crack the Skye"" - Mastodon</li> <li>""Cremation"" - King Diamond</li> <li>""Cry of the Banshee"" - Brocas Helm</li> <li>""Dawn of Battle"" - Manowar</li> <li>""Deadly Sinners"" - 3 Inches of Blood</li> <li>""Destroy the Orcs"" - 3 Inches of Blood</li> <li>""Diary of a Madman"" - Ozzy Osbourne</li> <li>""Die For Metal"" - Manowar</li> <li>""Dr. Feelgood"" - M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e</li> <li>""Drink the Blood of the Priest"" - Brocas Helm</li> <li>""Fast as a Shark"" - Accept</li> <li>""For the Glory Of"" - Testament</li> <li>""Free Your Hate"" - KMFDM</li> <li>""Frost"" - Enslaved</li> <li>""Girlfriend"" - Kabbage Boy</li> <li>""God of Thunder"" - Kiss</li> <li>""Goliaths Disarm Their Davids"" - In Flames</li> <li>""Hall of the Mountain King"" - Savatage</li> </ul> </td> <td valign=""top""> <ul> <li>""Her Ghost in the Fog"" - Cradle of Filth</li> <li>""High Speed Dirt"" - Megadeth</li> <li>""Holiday"" - Scorpions</li> <li>""Ignisis Dance"" - Wrath of Killenstein</li> <li>""In the Black"" - Mot&ouml;rhead</li> <li>""Insomnia"" - Dark Fortress</li> <li>""Kickstart My Heart"" - M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e</li> <li>""Lay It Down"" - Ratt</li> <li>""Leather Rebel"" - Judas Priest</li> <li>""Live Wire"" - M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e</li> <li>""Loke"" - Enslaved</li> <li>""Love Dump"" - Static-X</li> <li>""Machine Gunn Eddie"" - Nitro</li> <li>""March of the Crabs"" - Anvil</li> <li>""Marching Off to War"" - Mot&ouml;rhead</li> <li>""Master Exploder"" - Tenacious D</li> <li>""Murmaider"" - Dethklok</li> <li>""Metal Church"" - Metal Church</li> <li>""Metal Storm/Face the Slayer"" - Slayer</li> <li>""Metal Thrashing Mad"" - Anthrax</li> <li>""More Than Meets the Eye"" - Testament</li> <li>""Mr. Crowley"" - Ozzy Osbourne</li> <li>""Mr. Scary"" - Dokken</li> <li>""Narita"" - Riot</li> <li>""Never Say Die"" - Black Sabbath</li> <li>""Nightstalker"" - Cloven Hoof</li> <li>""No Love Lost"" - Carcass</li> <li>""Oblivion Instrumental"" - Mastodon</li> <li>""One Shot at Glory"" - Judas Priest</li> <li>""Overnight Sensation"" - FireHouse</li> <li>""Painkiller"" - Judas Priest</li> <li>""Progenies of the Great Apocalypse"" - Dimmu Borgir</li> <li>""Pure Evil"" - Iced Earth</li> <li>""Queen of Desire"" - Ostrogoth</li> <li>""Queen of the Masquerade"" - Crimson Glory</li> <li>""Riding the Storm"" - Running Wild</li> </ul> </td> <td valign=""top""> <ul> <li>""Rip the System"" - KMFDM</li> <li>""Road Racin"" - Riot</li> <li>""Rock Bottom"" - UFO</li> <li>""Rock of Ages"" - Def Leppard</li> <li>""Skeleton on your Shoulder"" - Coroner</li> <li>""Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your Neck"" - Prong</li> <li>""So Frail"" - Mirrorthrone</li> <li>""Soul Thrashing Black Sorcery"" - Skeletonwitch</li> <li>""Stigmata"" - Ministry</li> <li>""Still of the Night"" - Whitesnake</li> <li>""Sulphur Injection"" - Apostasy</li> <li>""Superbeast"" - Rob Zombie</li> <li>""Swords and Tequila"" - Riot</li> <li>""Symptom of the Universe"" - Black Sabbath</li> <li>""Tag Team"" - Anvil</li> <li>""Technical Difficulties"" - Racer X</li> <li>""The Axeman"" - Omen</li> <li>""The Beautiful People"" - Marilyn Manson</li> <li>""The Hellion/Electric Eye"" - Judas Priest</li> <li>""The Metal"" - Tenacious D</li> <li>""The Somber Grounds of Truth"" - Bishop of Hexen</li> <li>""The Wild and the Young"" - Quiet Riot</li> <li>""Thieves"" - Ministry</li> <li>""Through the Fire and Flames"" - DragonForce</li> <li>""Thus Spake the Nightspirit"" - Emperor</li> <li>""Tornado of Souls"" - Megadeth</li> <li>""Warriors Dawn"" - Slough Feg</li> <li>""(We Are) the Road Crew"" - Mot&ouml;rhead</li> <li>""Welcome Home"" - King Diamond</li> <li>""Wheels of Steel"" - Saxon</li> <li>""When the Night Falls"" - Iced Earth</li> <li>""Witches"" - Candlemass</li> <li>""World of Hurt"" - Overkill</li> <li>""Y.R.O."" - Racer X</li> <li>""Youth Gone Wild"" - Skid Row</li> <li>""Zoom Club"" - Budgie</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

You are heavy metal roadie Eddie Riggs, hurled back in time to the mythical Age of Metal when the world was formed and ruled by the power of Rock! Armed with a broadaxe, a guitar, and a big block V8 you set off on an epic quest to assemble an army of headbangers, hotrods, barbarians, demonic dominatrix and the undead. With the wings of a demon and the power of a Rock God, you must lead humanity in an epic war against its barbaric overlords, and carve your name forever into the <i>Brutal Legend</i>.<p/>In <i>Brutal Legend</i>, you'll roam through a massive open-world born from the hell fires of heavy metal. In this world you can rev up any vehicle, rock its weapons, and crush the enemies of metal. You'll also learn to devastate with your guitar, playing face-melting solos that actually melt the faces of your enemies, command savage armies, bang skulls in hand-to-hand combat, and rise like a bat out of hell to command blood-drenched action from above. As if that wasn't enough, you can slay your friends and foes online, then play guitar licks on their graves! Of course, <i>Brutal Legend</i> is only complete with the most ultimate heavy metal soundtrack ever assembled in a game.<p/><b>Features</b>:<ul><li>Slay your friends and foes online.

Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it&rsquo;s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it\'s a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike. <style type=""text/css""> .caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif;

Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It&rsquo;s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off. <p/> <b>Action Combat</b><br/> <i>Br&uuml;tal Legend</i>&rsquo;s core gameplay is classic action slasher, but with a twist: ranged combat comes from your demon-slaying, electricity-creating guitar. Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual. <p/> <b>A Streaming Open World</b><br/> <i>Br&uuml;tal Legend</i> gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of <i>Br&uuml;tal Legend</i> looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting. <p/> <b>Packed with Cameos and Voice Talent</b><br/> <i>Br&uuml;tal Legend</i> is full of cameos from gods of Metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970&rsquo;s classic metal to 1980&rsquo;s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990&rsquo;s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity. <p/> <b>Multiplayer Mayhem</b><br/> 4v4 &ldquo;skirmish&rdquo; multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. <i>Br&uuml;tal Legend</i>&rsquo;s multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online via PlayStation Network (broadband connection required for online play). <p/> <b>Soundtrack</b><br/> The soundtrack of <i>Br&uuml;tal Legend</i> is truly massive. Made up of 108 of the most rocking tracks from 75 different bands representing every sub-genre of metal, it is something to experience in and of itself.

The first three games in the series are centered on the sword play and gun slinging of demon hunter and long-time hero, Dante, but in the most recent release, <i>Devil May Cry 4</i>, players are thrown a changeup, as doubt is cast on the once unquestionable motives and actions of Dante by a new, yet somehow familiar hero, Nero.<p/><table align=left width=200 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img alt=""Devil May Cry 4"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dmc4_logo_white.jpg"" border=0 align=top><br><br><small><center><b><i>Supernatural action with style</i></b></center></small></td></tr></table><table align=right width=250 cellpadding=10><tr><td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dmc4-7-lg.jpg""><img alt=""Nero is the new kid in town"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dmc4-7-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><center><b><i>Nero has all the Demon fighting tools. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dmc4-7-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</i></b></center></small></td></tr><tr><td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dmc4-5-lg.jpg""><img alt=""Demons fear the reach of Nero\'s ""Devil Bringer"" arm"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dmc4-5-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><center><b><i>Demons rightly fear his ""Devil Bringer"" arm. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dmc4-5-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</i></b></center></small></td></tr><tr><td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dmc4-1-lg.jpg""><img alt=""Nero and Dante have a score to settle"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dmc4-1-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><center><b><i>There\'s bad blood between Nero and Dante. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dmc4-1-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</i></center></b></small></td></tr><tr><td><a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dmc4-3-lg.jpg""><img alt=""Dante going to style points with the Lucifer weapon"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dmc4-3-sm.jpg"" border=1 align=top></a><br><br><small><center><b><i>Dante\'s artful skill with the new Lucifer Weapon. <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/dmc4-3-lg.jpg"">View larger</a>.</i></b></center></small></td></tr></table><b>Meet the New Kid in Town - Nero</b><br>Nero resembles Dante and Dante&#146;s estranged twin brother Virgil, familiar to players from earlier games in the series. This might be more than a just a coincidence--you&#146;ll have to play through the game to find out for sure--but what is certain is that like Virgil, Nero has a serious problem with Dante; one that can only end badly for one of them.<p/>As <i>DMC4</i> opens players not only witness, but participate in Nero&#146;s trial by fire as he is unexpectedly forced to go head-to-head with Dante. The youngest, but most promising new member of the land of Fortuna&#146;s ""Holy Knights,"" the military arm of the ""Order of Maken,"" an organization pledged to destroy all demons as well as defend the memory and worship of Sparda, the historical Dark Knight who rebelled against the Dark Emperor to champion the fate of humanity, the Holy Knights highly respect Dante, who is a direct descendent of Sparda. This makes what Nero and players of the game must do all the more difficult, but no less necessary. A tutorial for learning and developing Nero&#146;s skills as well as serving as the game&#146;s first boss battle, playing as Nero, players must hold their own against the legendary demon hunter before they can proceed further into the game. But be prepared for Dante to return later in the game.<p/><b>The World of <i>Devil May Cry 4</i></b><br/>Just as in previous installments in the <i>DMC</i> series, the world players explore in <i>Devil May Cry 4</i> is lavishly gothic, feeling both ancient and modern simultaneously and is peopled by demons and demon hunters. In this dangerous world player&#146;s weapons are sometimes all they can count on. Although you begin your journey playing in the role of newcomer Nero, players will also have the opportunity to play as Dante, Both character&#146;s arsenals of weapons and abilities are impressive, but not too difficult to master. See the partial list of both character&#146;s weapons and abilities below:<p/>Nero<ul><li><u>""Devil Bringer"" Arm</u>: Integrated into Nero&#146;s right arm, it is a mystery even to Nero, but quickly reveals itself as a very effective weapon against demons, especially the largest among them.<li><u>Red Queen</u>: Effective at when swung at high speeds, this sword has a motorcycle handle base that sprays flammable liquid on enemies when squeezed.<li><u>Blue Rose</u>: Used for long range attacks, this pistol has two barrels which can be fired at once with armor piercing force.<li><u>The Exceed System</u>: Allows Nero to charge up his sword with a throttle effect, revving up to three levels with powerful attack options.</ul>Dante<ul><li><u>Force Edge</u>: Sharp and indestructible, this sword is a memento from his father Sparda, and was used to defeat the ancient enemy Mundus and seal the gateway to the underworld.<li><u>Ebony &amp; Ivory</u>: Dante&#146;s twin .45 caliber companion pistols. They are Dante&#146;s trusty companions as he battles supernatural evils.<li><u>Beowulf</u>: Double gauntlets and greaves hold a flashing power to strike down enemies at close distances.<li><u>Active Style Change System</u>: These allow Dante to switch between fighting styles and weapons on the fly, producing crazy combo possibilities that players will need to master.</ul>Leveling up of both characters is done through <i>DMC</i>&#146;s traditional orb collection system which can happen at any point in the game, while weapons and abilities are upgradable at the completion of levels through the new ""Proud Souls"" system. In addition the game&#146;s deep combo system rewards players for &#145;stylishly&#146; dispatching enemies by mixing and matching the weapons that they use in attacks, so it pays for players to get to know the arsenals.<p/><b> New Characters and Environments</b><br/> Joining Nero and Dante as they battle demons and each other throughout the game&#146;s next-generation enhanced environments are a wide array of non-player characters both old and new to the <i>Devil May Cry</i> series. Familiar faces from the past like Trish and Lady will be there as well as new characters like Kyrie to illustrate Nero&#146;s side of the story in the demon-filled landscapes of Fortuna and continue the legacy of fast paced, rich action players have come to expect from the <i>Devil May Cry</i> universe.<p/><b>Additional Collector\'s Edition Content:</b><ul><li>Heavy-duty metal game case with protective sleeve<li>The <i>Devil May Cry</i> Animated Series<ul><li>Volume 1 (4 full length episodes)<li>More than 2 hours of content<li>Learn more about the world of <i>Devil May Cry</i></ul><li>Bonus DVD<ul><li>Art gallery<li>Game soundtrack<li>""Making of"" video<li>Downloadable PC content</ul></ul>']","by
