You are not in this alone though. Additional AI members of your guild are at your command, and can be summoned to your aid if need be. In addition to this, for the first time in the <i>Assassin\'s Creed</i> franchise players can compete with other would-be assassins in multiplayer action. In multiplayer modes players choose from a range of Assassin characters, each with their own backstory, unique weapons and assassination techniques. Choose your assassin character, utilize the virtual reality capabilities of Abstergo Industries\' Animus technology and match your skills against other assassins from around the world. There\'s no time like now to join the Brotherhood. <p/> <b>Deadly Weapons Arsenal</b><br/> <i>Assassin\'s Creed: Brotherhood</i> features a wide variety of weapons, depending on the mode of play. In single player players primarily utilize Ezio\'s weapons of choice, the hidden blade and crossbow, while in multiplayer modes players gain access to a wide variety of weapon, depending on the character they choose to play as. Examples of this include: the Axe, wielded by the Executioner; the Fan, used by the Courtesan; the Syringe, the tool by the Doctor; the Dagger, used by the Priest; the Switchblade, carried by the Prowler; and the Claw, used by the Nobleman. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>As Ezio, a legendary Master Assassin, experience over 15 hours of single player gameplay set in the living, breathing, unpredictable city of Rome.</li> <li>Recruit and train promising young Assassins.

As a guest of the Royal Palms Resort, the player's stay was supposed to be a dream holiday; a luxurious getaway to the beautiful beaches of a tropical paradise. But faced with the reality of a zombie apocalypse, there is only one thing left to do: Survive. This is Dead Island a paradise to die for. The Island of Banoi: If you've been dreaming about paradise, we know a place where you can make those dreams come true. The Island of Banoi. Just off the coast of Papua New Guinea, located South of the Equator and just north of Australia. Until very recently much of the island was wild and primitive and totally untouched by the modern world. Even though the capital, Moresby, was founded by Australian settlers in 1895, many places deep in the interior still have never been seen by western eyes. Banoi's lush tropical beauty offers many natural wonders: from verdant rain forests to mountain highlands to virginal white sand beaches. Take a diving tour and experience the wonder of coral reefs teaming with life. Hike the mountain highlands or explore Banoi's extensive network of mysterious caves. Along the way you will encounter all manner of rare birds, butterflies, fish, reptiles, and mammals, including the great apes of the Banoi highlands. It's a sportsman's paradise with world-class rock climbing, fishing, hunting, sailing, and kayaking. Or if that sounds too taxing, find yourself a private beach, splash in the waves and soak up the sun. Meet the friendly people of Banoi. They are proud of their rich cultural heritage. The indigenous art is world renowned and unbelievably varied, reflecting the many local tribes with their own myths, legends and language. Come see what Heaven on Earth looks like. Come to beautiful Banoi. The pearl in the necklace of the Oceania Archipelago."", 'The island of Banoi is a lush, tropical paradise in the South Pacific where its flagship Royal Palms Resort serves as the ultimate getaway for vacationers with money to burn. However, all good things must soon come to an end - and the picturesque resort falls into madness, carnage and chaos after a mysterious and contagious zombie outbreak claims its once peaceful atmosphere. Cut off from the rest of the world, only four individuals who strangely find themselves immune to zombification have the power to protect the remaining survivors from the horrors of the island, to discover what\'s really going on and find a way to escape before their own fatal ends. <table align=right width=480 cellpadding=1> <tr> <td align=""center"">&nbsp;<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI7.jpg"" align=""center"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' game logo"" width=""285"" height=""200""></td> </tr> <tr> <td height=""129""> &nbsp;<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI1.jpg"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' screenshot 1"" border=""0"" align=""top"" width=""230""/> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI2.jpg"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' screenshot 2"" border=""0"" align=""top"" width=""230""/> </td> </tr> <tr> <td height=""129""> &nbsp;<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI3.jpg"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' screenshot 3"" border=""0"" align=""top"" width=""230""/> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI4.jpg"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' screenshot 4"" border=""0"" align=""top"" width=""230""/> </td> </tr> <tr> <td height=""129""> &nbsp;<img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI5.jpg"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' screenshot 5"" border=""0"" align=""top"" width=""230""/> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/760592011DI6.jpg"" alt=""\'Dead Island\' screenshot 6"" border=""0"" align=""top"" width=""230""/> </td> </tr> </table>', '<b>Gameplay Highlights</b>']","by

The Sims Medieval [Download],,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<div class=""aplus"">', '<em>The Sims Medieval</em> is a brand-new direction for the popular single player Simulation game franchise, as the familiar gameplay mechanics of <em>The Sims</em> are blended with light Role-Playing (RPG) elements in a Medieval European setting. In this new incarnation PC and Mac players must both assure the happiness of their Sims on a day-to-day level, as well as support the aims of the kingdom they build and engage in all manner of quests which Sims can take on singularly and in groups up to three. New features include: a wide range of available Sims hero types associated with buildings constructed, each with a fatal flaw to overcome; a leveling system for characters based in replayable quests; and an overall player-chosen goal for kingdoms.', '<em>The Sims Medieval</em> takes <em>The Sims</em> franchise into the Middle Ages with all new features, new graphics and new ways to play. For the first time, players can create heroes, venture on quests, and build up a kingdom all their own. In an ancient land of adventure, drama and romance, players will be able to get medieval like nobody could ever have imagined.', 'As with all <em>The Sims</em> games, <em>The Sims Medieval</em> is primarily a Simulation game where the player is responsible for all aspects of their sims\' lives. But <em>The Sims Medieval</em> expands on the classic <em>The Sims</em> gameplay formula by affecting the focus of players and their Sims via a change of environment and game mechanics. The game adopts a ""what if"" scenario, placing your sims in a Medieval setting, complete with castles, monarchs, knights, peasants, intrigue between kingdoms, etc. Thus the question is: What if a <em>The Sims</em> game was set in a Medieval European time period? The answer to this is that although the player must still be very concerned about the day to day happiness, or unhappiness, of their Sims, there are also other concerns appropriate to the time period, or at least the game\'s interpretation of the time period. This equates to the three-tiered approach to gameplay centered around: kingdom, heroes and quests.', ""Life in the kingdoms of <em>The Sims Medieval</em> revolve around castles and the other buildings and facilities that are added to a kingdom. As a kingdom is established players codify the overall ambition of their kingdom. These ambitions can reflect a variety of concerns, including political, military, economic, etc. and will serve as a sort of mission statement for everything that transpires among the Sims that populate a kingdom. In the end this initial decision affects both Sim happiness and the overall fate of your kingdom. With each building that is added during the game players gain access to specific hero character types associated with them. These range from lofty roles like rulers, knights and wizards, all the way to the more humble physicians, craftsmen, etc. These different types of Sims can be customized in ways familiar to players of earlier games, including apparel and temperament, as well as the new fatal flaw customization, which must be worked out if players choose to work towards their sims prospering. The cumulative experience of this customization makes up the building blocks of a Sim's day-to-day experience, actions in the kingdom and happiness. Once the player's Sims are established, the game opens up into an additional crucial gameplay area, quests."", 'Quests in <em>The Sims Medieval</em> contains a certain level of role-playing game mechanics, which is new to <em>The Sims</em> franchise, and which offers players the opportunity to earn skill points, experience points and kingdom points. Following standard RPG game mechanics, points allow for leveling up of Sims characters and kingdoms. Thus, quests are also a crucial element of the game that drives the story of the game forward, depending on their success or failure, the temperaments of the participating Sims and the goals of the kingdom. Simple quests can be taken on by a single Sim while more complex endeavors can require up to three Sim heroes. All quests contain multiple paths towards completion, which are further varied by the fact of the differing strengths and weakness of your chosen heroes. This type of flexibility in quests allows for maximum replay value of the game, as the outcome of quests can vary widely depending on the Sim heroes utilized.', '', '<small>INTERNET CONNECTION, ONLINE AUTHENTICATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT REQUIRED TO PLAY.

The perils of the dark ages were barely passing. It was the best of times and the worst of times. The Middle Ages spanned 1066 to 1485AD and spawned legends of King Arthur, Robin Hood, and many others. The life of all the classes was dominated by the feudal system. Romanticism, greed, magic, dominance and gut survival blended amidst feudal battles from one castle to another. The Feudal System was introduced to England following the invasion and conquest of the country by William The Conqueror. The Normans from the time they first settled there around 900AD had used the system in France. It was a simple, but effective system, where all land was owned by the King. The largest portion was kept by the King as his personal property, some was given to the church and the rest was leased out under strict controls. The King allowed those he could trust to lease land. These became Barons. They were wealthy, powerful and had complete control of the land they leased. You're a Baron.The Stronghold Collection brings together five games from the critically acclaimed real-time strategy (RTS) series that allows players to conquer the Middle Ages. The Stronghold series has become one of the most popular dynamic castle building sim games in the world, combining the finest aspects from the city builder and RTS genres.

Focused on historically based, intense, small-scale WWII combat rather than the mega battles set in sci-fi or fantasy game worlds that are common to most RTS games, this allows players to experience both the fruits and follies of their battlefield decisions on an intimate level as they truly become part of the story. This approach to storytelling is taken even further in three separate single player campaigns built into <em>Tales of Valor</em>. Set during the historical battles following the Allied invasion of Europe on D-Day, these three -- Tiger Ace, Causeway and Falaise Pocket -- illustrate the struggles of both individual German and Allied squads from both the perspective of tank commanders and crew and field soldiers. Each campaign contains three missions, allowing players to immerse themselves in the gameplay and get to know their squadmates.', ""<strong>New Multiplayer Vehicles and Modes</strong><br /> In addition to its single player campaigns, <em>Company of Heroes</em> also features significant new multiplayer functionality. The first example of this are the variety of vehicles that players will have access to in multiplayer modes. These include, but are not limited to, the 'Schwimmwagon' an German amphibious vehicle used for reconnaissance missions and enemy troop harassment; the Hellcat, a sturdy Allied plane valuable in battling tanks from above; and the Kangaroo, a heavily armored, British troop carrier. The game also contains three new multiplayer modes which utilize both Allied and Axis forces. 'Stonewall' mode is a co-op mode where players work together to fend off invasion as they struggle to keep a town from falling under enemy control. 'Assault' mode challenges players to push the limits of the front line as they choose a unit, battle opposing enemy units and attempt to destroy the opposition's headquarters. And finally, 'Panzerkrieg' is an all out arcade style tank battle where every unit is out for itself."", ""<strong>Direct Fire Control</strong><br /> As an extension of <em>Company of Heroes'</em> focus on small-scale, but intense combat, <em>Tales of Valor</em> features a new optional targeting system known as 'Direct Fire.' Through this players can target exact spots on tanks or other vehicles, specific areas of the battlefield or even individual soldiers within a unit. This ultra specific targeting system allows players to get even closer to the action than in previous games, yet is toggle based, making it is easy for players to return to standard firing as you choose. 'Direct Fire' is available in all single player campaigns, as well as the 'Panzerkrieg' multiplayer mode."", '<strong>Key Game Features</strong>:', '']","by

You are a Grey Warden, one of the last of an ancient order of guardians who have defended the lands on the continent of Thedas throughout the centuries. Betrayed by a trusted general in a critical battle, you must hunt down the traitor and bring him to justice. As you fight your way towards the final confrontation with an evil nemesis, you will face monstrous foes and engage in epic quests to unite the disparate peoples of a world at war. A romance with a seductive shapeshifter may hold the key to victory, or she may be a dangerous diversion from the heart of your mission. To be a leader, you must make ruthless decisions and be willing to sacrifice your friends and loved ones for the greater good.', '<strong>Gameplay</strong><br /> <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> is a 3D oriented RPG based in a dark, heroic, fantasy realm where moral choices have a lasting impression on the people you meet, the members of your own party and the world around you. The inclusion of subtitle ""Origins"" in the game\'s title refers to the six unique origin stories available to new heroes as a new game begins. Each of these has an impact on the player\'s motivations and his or her experience, and renders a unique prelude, path, and possible ending(s) to the game. There are many different endings to the game based on the origin story of the character and the choices you make as you play through the game. The game features three character classes--warrior, mage, and rogue--and three races of being--Human, Elf or Dwarf--that can assume these classes. Although most game elements, such as weapons, magic, etc., are available to any character, each class and race has different strengths, abilities and affinities which lend themselves to better utilizing different elements.', '<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> is a single player game based on party-based gameplay and combat where the player can join, control and quest with up to three non-player characters (NPCs). Players can also quest alone if they so choose, but with the chance of survival are slim. Convincing NPCs to join you, and treating them well may be necessary depending on the varying sentiments between the player and the NPC, or between the NPC\'s in the party based on the chosen history written into the origin story accepted at the beginning of the game. This uncertainty allows for a variety of possible dynamics within the party ranging from open hostility, all the way to romance. The game progresses in real-time via a pause-and-play tactical combat system that allows the player to check inventory levels, equip a character, etc. in a slight vacuum. Additional features found in the game include: a combination of a standard loot system and a currency system based on gold silver and copper; advanced character customization functionality; the use of poison, traps and herbalism; dual-wielding skills; and ""spell combos,"" which allow players to chain together different spells to create a unique effects.', '<strong>Key Game Features</strong>', 'EA account, registration with enclosed serial code, internet connection and acceptance of end user license agreement required to play and to access online features and/or services.

The Sims Medieval [Mac Download],,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<div class=""aplus"">', '<i>The Sims Medieval</i> is a brand-new direction for the popular single player Simulation game franchise, as the familiar gameplay mechanics of <i>The Sims</i> are blended with light Role-Playing (RPG) elements in a Medieval European setting. In this new incarnation PC and Mac players must both assure the happiness of their Sims on a day-to-day level, as well as support the aims of the kingdom they build and engage in all manner of quests which Sims can take on singularly and in groups up to three. New features include: a wide range of available Sims hero types associated with buildings constructed, each with a fatal flaw to overcome; a leveling system for characters based in replayable quests; and an overall player-chosen goal for kingdoms.', '<i>The Sims Medieval</i> takes <i>The Sims</i> franchise into the Middle Ages with all new features, new graphics and new ways to play. For the first time, players can create heroes, venture on quests, and build up a kingdom all their own. In an ancient land of adventure, drama and romance, players will be able to get medieval like nobody could ever have imagined.', 'As with all <i>The Sims</i> games, <i>The Sims Medieval</i> is primarily a Simulation game where the player is responsible for all aspects of their sims\' lives. But <i>The Sims Medieval</i> expands on the classic <i>The Sims</i> gameplay formula by affecting the focus of players and their Sims via a change of environment and game mechanics. The game adopts a ""what if"" scenario, placing your sims in a Medieval setting, complete with castles, monarchs, knights, peasants, intrigue between kingdoms, etc. Thus the question is: What if a <i>The Sims</i> game was set in a Medieval European time period? The answer to this is that although the player must still be very concerned about the day to day happiness, or unhappiness, of their Sims, there are also other concerns appropriate to the time period, or at least the game\'s interpretation of the time period. This equates to the three-tiered approach to gameplay centered around: kingdom, heroes and quests.', ""Life in the kingdoms of <i>The Sims Medieval</i> revolve around castles and the other buildings and facilities that are added to a kingdom. As a kingdom is established players codify the overall ambition of their kingdom. These ambitions can reflect a variety of concerns, including political, military, economic, etc. and will serve as a sort of mission statement for everything that transpires among the Sims that populate a kingdom. In the end this initial decision affects both Sim happiness and the overall fate of your kingdom. With each building that is added during the game players gain access to specific hero character types associated with them. These range from lofty roles like rulers, knights and wizards, all the way to the more humble physicians, craftsmen, etc. These different types of Sims can be customized in ways familiar to players of earlier games, including apparel and temperament, as well as the new fatal flaw customization, which must be worked out if players choose to work towards their sims prospering. The cumulative experience of this customization makes up the building blocks of a Sim's day-to-day experience, actions in the kingdom and happiness. Once the player's Sims are established, the game opens up into an additional crucial gameplay area, quests."", 'Quests in <i>The Sims Medieval</i> contains a certain level of role-playing game mechanics, which is new to <i>The Sims</i> franchise, and which offers players the opportunity to earn skill points, experience points and kingdom points. Following standard RPG game mechanics, points allow for leveling up of Sims characters and kingdoms. Thus, quests are also a crucial element of the game that drives the story of the game forward, depending on their success or failure, the temperaments of the participating Sims and the goals of the kingdom. Simple quests can be taken on by a single Sim while more complex endeavors can require up to three Sim heroes. All quests contain multiple paths towards completion, which are further varied by the fact of the differing strengths and weakness of your chosen heroes. This type of flexibility in quests allows for maximum replay value of the game, as the outcome of quests can vary widely depending on the Sim heroes utilized.', '<small>INTERNET CONNECTION, ONLINE AUTHENTICATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT REQUIRED TO PLAY.

In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.<br /><br /> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""98%""> <tbody> <tr> <td align=""left"" valign=""top""> <table align=""right"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""474"" height=""691""> <tbody> <tr> <td align=""right"" valign=""top"" width=""474""> <img alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshots (click to enlarge)"" border=""0"" height=""671"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_promo.jpg"" style=""border: 0;"" usemap=""#screenshots"" width=""454"" /><br /> <small>DEVELOPER: CD Projekt RED</small> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong>Brief Story Description</strong><br /><br /> After helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...<br /><br /> <strong>Key Features</strong><br /><br /> <ul> <li>A truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.</li> <li>A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.</li> <li>Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.</li> <li>New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.</li> <li>Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.</li> <li>Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.</li> <li>Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.</li> <li>Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!</li> <li>Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.</li> <li>Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options. Geralt will surmount barriers, jump over fences, scale walls and ascend rock formations.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><br /> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""98%""> <tbody> <tr> <td align=""left"" valign=""top""> <table align=""right"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""563""> <tbody></tbody> </table></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <map name=""screenshots""> <area alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshot 1"" coords=""216,429,318,488"" href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_screenshot01.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"" shape=""rect""></area> <area alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshot 2"" coords=""326,429,428,488"" href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_screenshot02.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"" shape=""rect""></area> <area alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshot 3"" coords=""216,496,318,555"" href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_screenshot03.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"" shape=""rect""></area> <area alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshot 4"" coords=""326,496,428,555"" href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_screenshot04.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"" shape=""rect""></area> <area alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshot 5"" coords=""216,564,318,623"" href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_screenshot05.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"" shape=""rect""></area> <area alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshot 6"" coords=""326,564,428,623"" href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_screenshot06.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"" shape=""rect""></area> </map><div class=""aplus""><table> <tr><td width=""70%""> <P> </P> <br/> <div class=""break""> </div> <h5>System Requirements</h5> <table style=""width: 100%"" border=1 cellpadding=""3""> <tr><td width=""18%"">&nbsp;</td><td width=""70%""><b>Minimum Specifications:</b></td></tr> <tr><td width=""18%"">OS:</td><td width=""70%"">Win 7, Vista and XP</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Processor:</td><td width=""70%"">2.2 GHz Dual Core</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">RAM:</td><td width=""70%"">1 GB (Windows XP), 2 GB (Windows Vista / Windows 7)</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Hard Drive:</td><td width=""70%"">13 GB</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Video Card:</td><td width=""70%"">nVidia GeForce 8800 / 512 MB</td></tr> <tr valign=""top""><td width=""18%"">Additional Info:</td><td width=""70%"">None</td></tr> </td></tr></table></div>']","by

To do this she must follow the lead of a mysterious being in the form of a black cat, and master an amazing and growing array of gravity-altering powers.', ""The gravity-manipulating powers at the center of the <i>Gravity              Rush</i> gameplay experience are tailor-made with the PlayStation              Vita in mind, and as such to ensure ease of play for all players.              Gravity abilities are easily initiated with the PS Vita's shoulder              buttons - pressing one to initiate levitation, and the other to initiate              a release from it. Between these two inputs, the PS Vita's gyro motion              sensor allows for the aiming of Kat to specific spots in the environment              by physically moving the console to reposition the onscreen cursor.              It's at the center of this cursor that Kat is dropped.""]","by

Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The ""Metal Gear Solid (MGS)"" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan\'s master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series\' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.', '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""> <html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""> <head> <meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" /> <title>Untitled Document</title> <script type=""text/javascript""> function MM_openBrWindow(theURL,winName,features) { //v2.0 window.open(theURL,winName,features); } </script> </head> <body> <table width=""100%"" border=""0""> <tr> <td width=""465"" valign=""top""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/mgsfullimage.jpg"" alt=""METAL GEAR SOLID HD COLLECTION"" width=""450"" height=""700"" border=""0"" usemap=""#Map"" /></td> <td valign=""top""><h4>Product Overview</h4> <p style=""font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size:12px;""> From the critically acclaimed director, Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection offers a handful of the most popular Metal Gear Solid titles from the past in true HD for the first time ever.

Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The ""Metal Gear Solid (MGS)"" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan\'s master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series\' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay.

Both technologies create the illusion of depth by slightly altering what users' eyes are exposed to. Passive 3D glasses block different kinds of emitted light from reaching each eye. The result is a 3D effect, but one in which certain light data has been omitted. In some cases this can equate to up to half of the available lines of resolution, meaning that this type of 3D effect can not reach the level of true 1080p HD. Active 3D on the other hand does not omit light sources from the spectrum, instead producing its 3D effect through a subtle dimming process of the individual lenses. PlayStation 3D glasses manage this effect seamlessly through their infrared connectivity. The result is a superior 3D effect, at full HD quality. Infrared connections between glasses and other components, as well as other 3D processes are kept constant through the glasses 30-hour rechargeable battery life."", 'Fans of co-op and competitive gaming modes are intimately familiar with local split-screen multiplayer functionality, which literally splits the visible display area of a single TV used in offline play to show the differing actions of individual players participating in the same game, at the same physical location. As advantageous as this is for group play, the quality of even the sharpest of HD television displays is compromised by the halving of the viewable area. SimulView Technology does away with this issue by enabling two players in a supported game to see their actions in-game displayed as full-screen. projections.<i>***</i> (The full requirement for the effect are: a PlayStation 3D Display, 2 pairs of PlayStation 3D Glasses, a PS3 system, a PS3 game that supports SimulView, and two players) Built on the Active 3D glasses technology and specially enhanced for gaming, SimulView technology brings players deeper in the game than ever before while still sharing the experience with a friend.

In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.<br /><br />  <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""98%""> <tbody> <tr> <td align=""left"" valign=""top""> <table align=""right"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""height: 691px;"" width=""474""> <tbody> <tr> <td align=""right"" valign=""top"" width=""474""><img alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshots (click to enlarge)"" border=""0"" height=""671"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_promo.jpg"" style=""border: 0;"" usemap=""#screenshots"" width=""454"" /><br /> <small>DEVELOPER: CD Projekt RED</small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong>Brief Story Description</strong><br /><br /> After helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...<br /><br /> <strong>Key Features</strong><br /><br />  <ul> <li>A truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.</li> <li>A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.</li> <li>Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.</li> <li>New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.</li> <li>Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.</li> <li>Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.</li> <li>Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.</li> <li>Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!</li> <li>Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.</li> <li>Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options. Geralt will surmount barriers, jump over fences, scale walls and ascend rock formations.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br />  <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""98%""> <tbody> <tr> <td align=""left"" valign=""top""> <table align=""right"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""563""> <tbody> <tr> <td align=""right"" valign=""top"" width=""563""><br /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong>Premium Edition Contents</strong><br /><br /> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">DIGITAL GAME</span><br /> The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings digital game.<br /><br /> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">MAKING-OF DIGITAL DVD</span><br /> All the cinematic materials related to game - trailers, dev diaries, gameplay footage, interviews and making-of exclusive video.<br /><br /><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">DIGITAL SOUNDTRACK </span><br /> in-game music.<br /><br /><br /> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">DIGITAL WORLD MAP</span><br /> A map of the game\'s world.<br /><br /> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">DIGITAL GAME GUIDE</span><br /> The Witcher 2 strategy guide for both novice and experienced role-playing fans.<br /><br /> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">DIGITAL GAME MANUAL</span><br /> A rulebook and interface explanation to help you get started.<br /><br /> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">DIGITAL PAMPHLET</span><br /> A Digital representation of one of the in-game items.<br /><br /> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">DIGITAL PAPERCRAFTS</span><br /> Two papercraft dolls - Geralt and one random character for collectors.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <strong>System Requirements</strong><br /><br /> Minimal Requirements:<br /> CPU: Dual-Core, 2,2 GHz.<br /> RAM: 1 GB (Windows XP), 2 GB (Windows Vista / Windows 7)<br /> GPU: nVidia GeForce 8800 / 512 MB <br /> OS: Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7<br /><br /> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_esrb.png"" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <map name=""screenshots""> <area alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshot 1"" coords=""216,429,318,488"" href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_screenshot01.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"" shape=""rect""></area> <area alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshot 2"" coords=""326,429,428,488"" href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_screenshot02.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"" shape=""rect""></area> <area alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshot 3"" coords=""216,496,318,555"" href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_screenshot03.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"" shape=""rect""></area> <area alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshot 4"" coords=""326,496,428,555"" href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_screenshot04.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"" shape=""rect""></area> <area alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshot 5"" coords=""216,564,318,623"" href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_screenshot05.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"" shape=""rect""></area> <area alt=""Witcher 2 Screenshot 6"" coords=""326,564,428,623"" href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/witcher2_screenshot06.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=820,height=470\'); return false;"" shape=""rect""></area>  </map>']","by
