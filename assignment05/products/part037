Chameleon Twist II - Nintendo 64,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Cartridge only with minor wear.', 'The original Chameleon Twist was a first-generation 3D N64 platform game that had its share of problems but also possessed some inventive boss enemies and a certain degree of charm. It wasn\'t amazing by far, but it wasn\'t offensive either, and it ended up being called by many a ""good kid\'s game."" <P>In the first game, you played as a chameleon that used his long-stretching tongue to propel his way around a 3D Mario-esque world. When enemies attacked, you\'d either gobble them up outright or snarf up items to spit at them, just like Mario\'s pal Yoshi. All these things remain true in CT2; however, you\'ve gained a new move (a parachute glide) and lost something vitally important: control of the 3D camera. <P>The innovative boss showdowns still exist in the sequel, and that spark of originality can be seen much more readily in the stages that precede them; for example, having to knock birds off a balloon to end up at the same altitude as a power-up or gobble up and spit enemies at upright platforms to knock them down so you can hop on them. Unfortunately, the perspective problems lead to enough cheap deaths as to write off the game almost completely. This fatal flaw makes one think that developers didn\'t pay attention to the lessons learned not only from the first Chameleon Twist, but also from every other 3D platform game up to this point. It\'s a shame because otherwise the game would\'ve turned out as middle-of-the-road charming as before. If you really enjoyed the last CT, then rent this one, knowing full well what you\'re getting into. Otherwise, avoid it. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

In your quest to become the ultimate streaker, you must master a dozen roller coaster-like courses, filled with SingleTrac's signature half-pipes, head-on suicide sections, and canyon-sized jumps."", 'Just as Rogue Trip was an unofficial sequel to Twisted Metal 2 (Sony retained ownership of the series after SingleTrac was purchased by GT Interactive), Streak is the spiritual successor to the Jet Moto series; apart from piloting a hoverboard instead of a rocket cycle, the two games look and play almost identically.

Choose from any of the 16 playable characters including warriors, mages, elves, and other classes to lead the fight. With over 250 moves and combos, there is plenty ADVANCED DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS action.', 'One would think a game bearing the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons license would at least be mildly entertaining. Instead, gamers get just a fighting game - and a bad one at that. If one word had to be used to sum up Iron and Blood, ""laughable"" would fit just fine. Playing Iron and Blood is as painful as being hit over the head repeatedly with a blunt object. Character control is slow and unresponsive: Think of the type of game where it\'s hard to tell if the move you made was a special move or not (occasionally the announcer shouts ""Combination!"" to let you know you probably did something right). Campaign mode adds a team aspect, where you pick a series of characters and do battle with opposing forces. This is where artifacts come into play, which can enhance a character by making him stronger or faster, or bringing fallen compatriots back to life. Onscreen, Iron and Blood looks like a real clunker. While still photos make it out to be a pretty sharp-dressed game, the motion is jerky and the camera angles are horrible. The game seems to be very fond of the behind-the-back view, which makes accurate player control a far-off dream. The back of the box boasts ""Death strikes at 225,000 polygons per second,"" but fails to mention that the ""death"" is the player dying of sheer frustration. The only point in favor of this game is character variety. You can pick from several different characters, including a headsman, complete with his head-chopper, an elf with his bow, a goblin with two short swords, or even Torgo, the one-armed dwarf who beats his opponents into submission with his giant hammer. Too bad they look better on the select screen menu than they do in the actual game. This game could have been good. With some gameplay tweaks, a better sense of camera angling, and smoother motion, it would have been a hell of a fighter. Instead it is a bleak reminder that all polygon games aren\'t as smooth as Tekken 2. If someone attempts to pawn this game off on you, do yourself a favor and just say no.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Ten Pin Alley,,"['1-6 Players', 'Multi Tap Adaptable']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['PlayStation ~ Ten Pin Alley', ""Bowling video games have always had a fundamental flaw: The hardware wasn't powerful enough to handle the near-infinite number of ways pins can break. The huge number of possibilities was therefore simplified to a few dozen potential results. The result was that most average players could learn to bowl a 300 game after a few lines. But that all changed when Tin Pin Alley struck the Playstation. <P>Ten Pin Alley is anything BUT simplified - the programmers relied on technical assistance from a major university to come up with physics algorithms. And it shows. The pins in this game break with uncanny realism - it couldn't look any better if they'd motion-captured strikes and spares. The power meter is also very well-designed, and requires a surprising amount of timing to get it right. In this regard, Ten Pin Alley the look and feel of a top-of-the-line golf game. Bowling 300 in Ten Pen Alley is as difficult as in real life, which is to say, all but impossible. Strangely enough, this feature is one of the game's most appealing aspects: It requires players to make tiny technique adjustments and constantly work to find the perfect delivery. <P>Ten Pin Alley's brilliant gameplay is balanced with humorous graphics that capture the lighter side of the sport. The texture mapped, polygon rendered characters (which range from Fred Flintstone clones to adorable kids) react to success and failure in cartoon-like fashion: Strikes are punctuated with celebratory air-punching, while gutter balls cause the characters to groan, scream, and cry like babies. <P>Ten Pin Alley's one weakness isn't even present in the game; rather it's the too-thin instruction manual. The manual assumes the player has an intermediate knowledge of bowling, which might not always be the case. For example, why would a player want to choose a heavier ball, or one made of urethane instead of resin? The manual doesn't say. Perhaps an in-game tutorial would have been a wise addition. <P>Plain and simple: Ten Pin Alley is loaded with addictive action that's equally fun played alone or with friends. This game isn't as fun as real bowling - it's more fun than real bowling. The editors at VideoGameSpot cringe when reviewers use hyperbole, but this time it's warranted: Ten Pin Alley is unquestionably the best bowling game yet created. --Peter Criscuola <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

And the ability to set up your own Cups and Leagues make FIFA '99 the soccer game to beat this year!"", ""When the soccer-on-the-brain Brits at GameSpot UK gave the PC version of FIFA 99 a score of 11 - out of 10 - it surely caused many gamers to set high expectations for the console ports of EA Sports' venerable franchise. While it can't match the PC in terms of graphics, the PlayStation version of FIFA 99 stands out as a soccer game that plays fast and looks good doing it."", ""The FIFA series on the PlayStation has made continuous strides to improve frame rate and game speed; FIFA 99 seems to have made the greatest leaps in this category. The default speed is very easy on the eyes, and when the gameplay speed is cranked to fastest, it still runs smoothly. Bottom line: no choppy animation, no sluggish player control... no complaints. It's a far cry from the PlayStation's FIFA days of (relative) old."", 'Visually, the game has its slight drawbacks. Up close, players look somewhat blocky and reveal the occasional polygon flicker. In some far-away camera views, the field textures show cracks. Fortunately, these cosmetic blemishes are hardly noticeable, thanks to the very realistic and eye-pleasing player animations such as when goals are missed or scored.', ""Like earlier FIFA titles, this game comes fully loaded with options. It boasts all the key international soccer leagues, teams, and players, along with the ability to customize anything from cup tournaments to the colors on a player's sock. This game's in-depth team strategies remain intact for players keen on coaching as well as playing. FIFA 99 also introduces two smart playing modes that will surely appeal to soccer fans. The first is a European dream league mode that pits the best teams from the various leagues against each other. The second is a golden goal mode that sets a goal limit between two teams. The latter option is a surprisingly great multiplayer mode since it kills the clock - it's odd no one thought of this before."", 'Once again, EA Sports tapped into the alt-rock realm to spruce up a soccer game, this time recruiting Fatboy Slim\'s ""Rockafeller Skank"" as the game\'s theme song. The various song tracks, along with accurately timed two-person play-by-play commentary, make FIFA 99 an enjoyable listening experience.', 'FIFA 99\'s main shortcomings are, for the most part, fixable, thanks to the game\'s wealth of options. The most glaring hole (at least for US gamers) will likely be the ""fake"" US league play with non-Major League Soccer teams and players. Granted, EA Sports doesn\'t own the rights to MLS, but it seems awfully cheesy when generic US teams have to duke it out in Istanbul or Paris. Fortunately, there\'s a partial fix for die-hard MLS fans: Use the team and player edit modes to rename the teams and players, and change their uniform colors. Another small blemish is the default difficulty, which seems a shade too easy, even for beginners. You should set the difficulty to professional to get the most realistic feel in terms of AI. Another AI gripe is that computer teammates usually play conservatively to a fault. Don\'t expect them to chase after loose balls or foul hard on their own, even after setting aggressive offense/defense team strategies.', ""It'll be a couple years until the next World Cup, but FIFA 99 surely packs enough punch to keep soccer fans satisfied in the meantime. While not completely perfect, it's deep on options, packed with real teams and players, and presented with a slick interface. This makes it arguably the best soccer game to date for the PlayStation. --Nelson Taruc <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Iron Man / X-O Manowar: In Heavy Metal - PS1,,['Action'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation']",{},"[""A futuristic personal combat game. Metal titans Iron Man and X-O Manowar come together for the first time ever to tackle one heavy duty cosmic crisis. It's an apocalyptic meltdown of furious fighting action with the ultimate in superhero power and realism. Some features: bi-directional and z-axis firepower chest beam blasts multi-hit combos asteroid destruction."", 'Ironman/X-O Manowar: Heavy Metal combines side-scrolling action, heavy metal music, and the mediocrity for which Acclaim is infamous. The result is a 32-bit game that seems somewhat thrown together. Comic fans may get a kick out of this title, but the game drops squarely into ""average"" territory, offering nothing new to a genre that peaked on the 8-bit Nintendo. <P>The look of the characters in Iron Man/X-O Manowar are acceptable for a 32-bit game - they\'re 3-D, pre-rendered smoothly animated sprites. For a comic book game these graphics work. Even so, they give the game a rough quality - one on par with games that were released at tail end of the Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis\'s heyday. Both Iron Man and X-O Manowar have a decent amount of moves, but neither comes off as the stereotypical badass players demand in a game like this. In fact, neither character can even remotely compete with the side scrolling characters of the past; Hagar, Guy, Axel, or Gambit - they even fall short of Chip and Dale (of Rescue Rangers fame), in terms of two character punch and kick duos. The best that can be said for these two metal-suited heroes is that their hover feature rocks, and their requisite ""nuke everything"" special attacks are cool. Sound is the game\'s highest point - the fast-paced heavy metal soundtrack truly supplements the frequent explosions and excellent-sounding action of the game. <P>The gameplay in this title is very standard. Each level challenges players to move forward while destroying a series of enemies that culminates with a showdown against a somewhat-tough boss character. This is standard fare for this game genre. Each level has a detailed pre-action briefings, including pictures of the enemies ahead, in addition to level and mission objectives. Nonetheless, players who ignore this briefing will still know what to do. The numerous obstacles on each of the many fast-paced levels will put any player\'s reflexes and maneuvering abilities to the test; and each level should provide enough challenge to hold even an average-ability gamer\'s interest. The control may seem a little strange at first, but can be mastered pretty easily. Even so, it takes some getting used to pull off the four or so available moves (a combination of punches, grabs, and kicks). <P>For those players who associate punch and kick fests with gaming of past (and want something a bit more cutting edge), a title like Tobal No.1 is a far better choice. But players who really miss the days of Contra and Final Fight, or who love Iron Man or X-O Manowar, have reason enough to check out this game. --Matt Rubenstein <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

It is a truly magnificent accomplishment - much more stunning than the baseball game that brandishes the same name.', ""For what it's worth, Triple Play '98 is the slickest-looking baseball game on the market. After you boot it up, the game greets you with an outstanding full motion video sequence that fades away to reveal snazzy, intuitive menus that are chock-full of options. After you choose the teams and a stadium to play in, the CD loads - and it's barely noticeable because a mini-trivia game appears instead of a boring load screen. Once the quick trivia (and the load) is finished, another excellent FMV sequence (a breathtaking aerial flyby of the stadium) introduces you to the baseball field."", ""On the field, Triple Play's new 3-D graphics look absolutely stunning. The use of motion capture has really paid off, as the players move realistically, right down to their nervous bat twitches at home plate. But while there is plenty of aesthetically impressive improvement, many of the problems in last year's game still plague the '98 edition. The slow frame rate is the biggest annoyance, affecting many important facets of gameplay. For example, the swing of the bat isn't as fluid as it should be, making it harder to time the hitting of pitches. Also, the screen struggles to scroll when it follows hard hit balls into the outfield."", 'Unlike the graphics, the audio has very few flaws. Triple Play has what EA proudly introduces as the ""first ever two-man broadcast booth."" Basically, this consists of the banter of play-by-play man Jim Hughson and color commentator Buck Martinez.

This game, however, has raised the bar by providing the most thoroughly complete console baseball game ever. All of the MLB licenses add authenticity to Triple Play, but things like the expansion draft (for the two teams that enter the league next year) and a detailed player creation feature make this game stand out.

NBA Hangtime - PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Midway took a lot of heat when its arcade basketball game hit the Nintendo 64, despite delivering a near-perfect arcade experience. Unfortunately for PlayStation owners, this version of NBA Hangtime falls very short of expectations and definitely deserves all the stinging criticism it\'s going to get. <P>NBA Hangtime is the unofficial sequel to NBA Jam, and it plays very similarly. The same tried and true gameplay formula applies: Two-on-two basketball that has few rules, no fouls, and plenty of spectacular dunks. Defense consists of knocking down guys on the other team and swatting away balls. Offensively, it\'s just as satisfying to embarrass the opposition by performing gravity-defying slam dunks as it is to score. If you score three times in a row, you get the special bonus of being ""on fire."" That is, you can drain shots from virtually anywhere on your half of the court. <P>Hangtime becomes more fun with every human player who\'s added to mix. Get up to four playing simultaneously, and the stage is set for some fun and fierce competition. Finding decent players shouldn\'t be much of a problem, as Hangtime\'s simplicity makes it easy for novice players to pick up. To further spice up the matches, custom players can be created to resemble anything from a clown to a seven-foot chicken. These created players win extra attribute points (allowing them to improve their scoring, speed, etc.) by answering trivia questions correctly at the end of each match. After answering a lot of questions correctly, your created player will be nearly unstoppable. There are also the requisite hidden characters that can be accessed through the password menu. <P>Fast-paced gameplay is what Hangtime is supposed to be built on, and the lack of it is what really cripples the PlayStation version. There\'s entirely too much loading time - especially for a game that only lasts a few minutes. It loads to start the game, then again between quarters, and also for substitutions. Although this is somewhat forgivable because of the storage medium, the slowdown during gameplay is not. Inbounding the ball and having four players on the screen at once seems to give the game fits. It makes the play sluggish for just enough time (and regularity) that the game becomes annoying to play. While the game\'s graphics do justice to the arcade, they are by no means cutting edge. The PlayStation isn\'t a great machine when it comes to 2-D graphics, but it isn\'t as weak as Hangtime\'s questionable performance implies. The only portion of the game that surpasses the N64 version is the music, which isn\'t much of a feat considering the space that CD-based games have available to them. <P>Hangtime\'s technical problems undermine the very elements that make this franchise so compelling. Unless you\'re a die-hard fan of the arcade game (and only own a PlayStation), stay far away from the PlayStation translation of NBA Hangtime - it makes the N64 version appear a delectable treat. --Darren Lerhman <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

A turn-based strategy game Master of Monsters delivers everything imaginable. Take command of the land by creating your own monsters to fight against enemies. Have your creations gain levels and experience by defeating enemy monsters. A plethora of different landscapes will add lasting value to this title as well as the endless fun of taking over the world in campaign mode.', ""Ascii's Master of Monsters for the Sony PlayStation falls into the category of strategy RPG, in as far as playing it is like a match of... RPG chess. You control one of six commanders who summon up monster troops to fight the forces of an enemy commander or commanders. Each type of monster has its plusses and minuses. For instance, a unicorn can cover a lot of ground but is generally pretty weak, while a serpent is very powerful but doesn't move all too fast. You can combine creatures in special shrines as well, giving the game a small degree of Monster Rancher flavor. If the melding goes well, you might get something cool like an ass-kicking Golem, but if the match is poor, you'll probably end up with a little puddle of woe that is the Slime. Once everything is set and on the field, it's all turn-based, one-on-one combat, with the different types of terrain and other similar factors weighing in to affect each fight's outcome. <P>It's a decent enough recipe for a game, but it's got problems in its implementation. Master of Monsters' interface is very clunky, the storyline is cheesy, the music is a dull repetitive loop, and the graphics aren't too much beyond what you'd expect from the original MOM for the Sega Genesis. Altogether, save for the infrequent bit of voice-over, it seems it could've been done for the 16-bit systems. But none of these factors means much to a strategy game if the strategy is advanced enough, right?  <P>That's the rub. Master of Monsters has really basic AI, which is tuned so that your opponents go straight after your commander with little or no consideration as to the taking or retaking of towers - one of the main strategic focuses of the game. As such, each round consists of sending out Rocs, Pegasi, and other fast-moving creatures to claim neutral or enemy towers. Doing this increases the number of monsters you call or summon, and, in the latter case, lessens the number that the enemy is capable of bringing in. From there, it's just a matter of picking off your opponent's dwindling ranks and then your opposition himself. Repeat and serve. Sound simple? Too much so. It only approaches being a challenge when you're facing more than one opponent at the same time.  <P>Still, MOM has its addictive qualities, and its multiplayer mode offers you the option to square off against three other human opponents with the best monster as the pot (multiplayer with a prize, not bad). There are a few nice minor touches too, such as being able to turn off the time-wasting battle animations (bet you would've liked to have done this to the spell displays in over a dozen RPGs) and a button command to show which monsters you haven't used yet. But when it all comes down to it, let's face it, games are expensive, and you'd be better off saving your money for stronger strategy RPGs such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Dragon Force, or Tactics Ogre. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Fighters Destiny,,['n64'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['Unique features and innovative design make this fighting game stand out from the rest of this incredibly popular action-game genre. Victory conditions are much more complex than just knocking out your foe and you can fully customize the points awards as well as all other match parameters.', 'The N64 has yet to have a really good fighting game. A few have been passable, but everything to date has been flawed in some fundamental way. Enter Fighters Destiny, a surprisingly original-feeling game, considering how much of it has been ""borrowed"" from other fighting games. It isn\'t perfect, but it still blows away the competition by a long shot. <P>Scoring in Fighters Destiny is done very differently than in other games. Instead of the typical two-out-of-three system, FD uses a point-based system, with each type of takedown giving a different number of points. The first fighter to seven points wins the fight and continues onward. Since points are awarded for takedowns, throws are a higher priority than in most other games. Throws are very easy to break, so don\'t expect to win all of your fights with a quick hip-toss. <P>The characters in the game vary from Ryuji, the game\'s token Ryu-alike, to a happy-go-lucky clown. Most of the standard fighting game types are represented, including a ninja character, a wrestler, and more. The design isn\'t original by any means, but it works very well. <P>The game has a few unique modes to it. Besides the standard ""beat everybody else up real bad"" mode, there is a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a rodeo mode, which pits your character against a fighting cow, and your chore is to remain in the ring for as long as possible. Since tossing the cow out of the ring also stops the fight, you have to keep the cow at bay but can\'t beat it so badly that it loses. It\'s quite a challenge. The master challenge mode allows you to earn extra moves by fighting the master to gain skills. But if you pick a joker\'s card, you must beat the joker or lose all of your built-up skills. These pumped-up characters can be taken into the other modes and saved to a controller pack. <P>Graphically, Fighters Destiny comes across pretty well, although the entire game has a strangely blurry look to it. The sound is tolerable, but the speech is sampled at a very low quality, resulting in muffled, hard-to-understand effects. <P>The unique scoring system and variety of modes make Fighters Destiny a winner. It may not have the best characters or the best graphics, but it\'s a well-rounded game, which is more than I can say about any other N64 fighting game. Until someone finally gets it right, Fighters Destiny stands alone as the best N64 fighter on the market. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Dark Reign 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<I>Dark Reign 2</I> introduces gamers to the first true 3-D RTS game this fall. Set against the backdrop of the war between the powerful Jovian Detention Authority and the upstart Sprawlers, <I>Dark Reign 2</I> is the prequel to the conflict between the Imperium and Freedom Guard. Incorporating a new game engine, <I>Dark Reign 2</I> offers new strategic elements, incredible graphics, new RTS enhancements, and spectacular multiplayer game play, setting the standard for all RTS games to come.', ""Pandemic Studios' Dark Reign 2 is a fully 3D real-time strategy game that looks excellent and plays quite well. The game takes place on a futuristic Earth torn by a war between two powerful factions, the JDA and the Sprawlers. Each is equipped with infantry, naval, aerial, and tank units that attack each other with shimmering laser beams and explosive shells. All in all, Dark Reign 2 is a solid, balanced, and very polished game - which is why it's all the more unfortunate that its gameplay closely follows an otherwise unoriginal and limited formula for real-time strategy games: Gather resources, amass troops, and attack your enemy."", ""It's true that Dark Reign 2 looks great. Each of the game's units, from the poised Guardian and Castigar infantry units of the JDA to the Sprawlers' double-barreled Scorpion tanks, is extremely detailed. Each military unit fires weapons, like glowing lasers that strike their targets and explode in a burst of colored light, volleys of projectile ammunition that leave arcing trails of white smoke in their wake, bolts of searing lightning, or other equally impressive armaments. If you've seen any static screenshots of Dark Reign 2, you've probably already seen many of the game's slick-looking units and spectacular explosions. You may not know that some of the firing animations, particularly on infantry units, are stiff and awkward-looking, and that the debris that flies up in the air from a destroyed building is usually nothing more than poorly animated black polygonal chunks. But these are relatively minor problems in a game with otherwise excellent graphics - problems that for the most part don't make Dark Reign 2's futuristic buildings and various military units any less attractive."", ""You'll find these units in equally impressive environments: lush, grassy hills bounded by lakes and waterfalls; ruined cities strewn with futuristic wreckage; bleak, sandy deserts; and others. And in all cases, you'll be able to use Dark Reign 2's extremely flexible camera to pan, zoom, rotate, and scroll around the screen in more or less exactly the way you want. And thanks to Dark Reign 2's powerful graphics and terrain engine, you can zoom in for a close-up view of the treads on your Bulldog tanks or the curved healing staff of your Voodun priests - a view that has absolutely no tactical value whatever but looks great. And you can zoom back out to get a better view of the action - which you'll do often, to be able to take better control of your units - with little to no loss in frame rate or speed. In addition, Dark Reign 2 uses its graphics engine for both its in-game levels and for many of its real-time cinematic cutscenes. Though a few of these cutscenes feature close-ups on blocky, poorly animated characters, most of them look quite good, and the transitions between cutscenes and missions are seamless."", ""Regrettably, Dark Reign 2 doesn't sound quite as good as it looks. Most of the game's sound effects, like firing weapons and explosions, sound adequate but otherwise plain. And though certain units, like the spunky Sprawler Go-Gos, sound distinctive enough to be memorable, most of the game's units sound fairly generic. The rest of Dark Reign 2's voice acting is fairly good, including the spoken dialogue in the game's cutscenes. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the game's musical score. Though many of the game's music tracks begin with or contain a stirring and ominous sequence that suggests a sort of epic grandeur, these serious sequences typically give way to disappointing industrial techno riffs that detract considerably from any sense of epic scale."", 'Despite whatever else might be said about its sound or graphics, Dark Reign 2 plays quite well. The mid to late games are often extremely strategic, and they require you to carefully select the right units for the right job. That\'s because Dark Reign 2 - like other strategy games before it - has a number of features to discourage early-game ""rush"" tactics with low-level units. For instance, most low-level units are fairly slow on their feet, and the game lets you defend your base with powerful and inexpensive stationary turrets from the get-go - turrets that will make short work of a simple squad of base-level troops. What\'s more, both of the game\'s factions may build powerful turrets that are specifically designed to wreak havoc on either airborne or grounded troops - though these specialized turrets themselves are usually vulnerable to attacks from enemies they aren\'t specifically designed to attack. In fact, most of Dark Reign 2\'s units are designed this way. Each has particular strengths - which can often be used to great effect against a specific type of enemy unit - and particular weaknesses that render them nearly useless in other situations. As such, you must build a balanced and varied army to succeed in Dark Reign 2. Fortunately, the game provides a great number of interesting units with distinctive abilities, including cloaking devices, powerful anti-air or antipersonnel attacks, long-distance sniping, infiltration, theft, and more. Such distinctive abilities are not only interesting in their own right, but they also lend themselves well to combined-unit strategies. And the two factions\' units are different enough to make playing each a different experience; the heavily armored JDA are much more straightforward and are clearly intended for less-experienced players, but their defensive power is balanced extremely well against the Sprawlers\' ragtag crew of more exotic troops.', ""Dark Reign 2's interface is useful and informative but not cluttered. The game clearly shows how much taelon (the game's main resource) you've harvested and how much solar power (the game's secondary resource) you've collected. (Solar power collection relates to the game's day/night cycles, which affect both the quantity of solar power you can collect and some units' line of sight.) In addition, you can easily jump to any part of the map and manipulate the camera to get the best view of your units, which you can arrange in up to ten different squadrons. In fact, each of the game's interfaces - both the in-game menus and the multiplayer interfaces - is cleanly and intuitively laid out."", ""Dark Reign 2's single-player campaign features missions for both the JDA and Sprawlers, but the game also offers competitive and cooperative multiplayer play on WON.net. Connecting to the multiplayer servers is completely painless, and Dark Reign 2's multiplayer is very stable, even over a dial-up connection. What's more, Dark Reign 2 offers multiple modes of play; in addition to standard head-to-head competitive games, you may also play the game in four other interesting modes: bloodbath (in which you must be the first to destroy 50 enemy units), gluttony (in which you must collect 30,000 taelon - or steal 1,000 taelon with spy units), protect HQ (in which you must defend and keep a command center at all times), and king of the hill (in which you must capture a spot on a hill and defend it for a set period of time)."", ""Unfortunately, Dark Reign 2 suffers from a few problems. First, the game uses a flawed system for unit pathfinding, in which each unit in a selected group attempts to move to its destination along roughly the same path. As such, it's not uncommon for your squadron to file along a path, then bottleneck around the narrowest point because the units in the front couldn't get past each other. This isn't quite as much of a problem as in other real-time strategy games, since many of the game's units travel at roughly the same pace, and most travel relatively slowly over land, which makes managing them individually slightly easier. Furthermore, though you can order your units to line up in rudimentary unit formations (wedge, box, line, scatter), your troops won't stay in formation once they move, which makes formations ineffective in practice."", ""But Dark Reign 2's biggest problem isn't a specific gameplay mechanic - it's the gameplay itself. Despite its powerful and extremely attractive 3D graphics engine, Dark Reign 2 ultimately fails to tread much new ground. To the game's credit, Dark Reign 2 does make good use of its 3D graphics engine and incorporates it fairly well into gameplay; for instance, mountains and hills play a real role as both impassable obstacles for ground units and useful surveillance and ambush points for flying units. However, Dark Reign 2's core gameplay is uninspired: As with so many other games, in Dark Reign 2, you must build up your own base, starting with a central command structure, then a resource refinery, then a barracks, and so on. Though each of the game's two factions develops differently later on in the game, each must still build and send unarmed heavy vehicles to harvest resources. And while it's largely unfeasible to attempt an early-game rush attack, the game still generally boils down to speed. The player who can quickly develop his base and create the most effective army by turning out units as fast as possible will still win. It's a formula that Dark Reign 2 has refined and balanced well, and it is certainly enjoyable for what it is, though it's the same formula that's been used in many other real-time strategy games before.<br> --<i>Andrew Seyoon Park</i> <br>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc.

Milo's Astro Lanes,,['Nintendo 64'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"[""A cosmic blend of 3D miniature golf and bowling. Sound cool? It is cool. Set in a retro-future wonderland Milo's Astro Lanes transports you to space-age settings where you can challenge the finest - and strangest - bowlers in the universe. Best of all you can ditch those nasty old bowling shoes you have to wear at your neighborhood bowling lanes."", 'It\'s a shame there aren\'t more bowling games out on console systems today. In the abstract, bowling games can appeal to the senses in ways similar to golf. Most, if not all of the action is strategized before the ball is actually sent on its way so that at the moment of release, players relinquish the reins of control and rely on the game engine to process whether or not the execution was effective. Unlike bowling, golf\'s mainstream appeal has paved the grass green for golf games on both consoles and PCs. Bowling titles, on the other hand, appear to be financial roulettes for game developers. Enter Milo\'s Astro Lanes, developed by Player 1 and published by Crave Software for the Nintendo 64 - the system\'s first and only bowling title. Player 1 adds plenty of twists to the game of bowling in an attempt to spice up the game of bowling, but in the end, this also becomes the game\'s undoing. <P>In a sweeping thematic decision, everything in Milo\'s Astro Lanes swings with the happy-go-lucky veneer of the atomic golden age from the 1950s. The end result is that the art direction is strikingly Jetson-esque, sans the Flintstones contrast. It\'s the 22nd century, and you\'re Milo, a ""techno-wiz"" who spends his days honing his skills for the Astro Games (bowling). The Astro Games are televised across the universe and attract competitors from all reaches of the galaxy. The manual excitedly points out that ""the Astro Games uses an exciting blend of bowling and miniature golf, both extremely popular during the 20th century!"" Go figure. <P>Milo\'s Astro Lanes has two main modes of play: league and versus. In league mode, you compete against other Astro Bowlers for the elusive Astrolight Trophy while unlocking all 12 lanes available in the game. Each bowler begins by selecting an Astro Ball, which has no effect on performance, only aesthetics. Aside from Milo, there are five other characters you may choose from. As expected, each character has different throwing characteristics, which can play a role in your bowling style. There is something strangely appealing about the heavy-handed kitsch found throughout Milo\'s Astro Lanes. While the character design is generic, it is also offbeat enough to stir up cult-status affections, if you\'re into that sort of thing. Planetary, galaxy, and cosmos make up the three different categories in league play. There are four lanes per league - you must progress through each one in order to ascend towards the Astrolight Trophy. The matches are standard ten-frame games run on established bowling rules (spares, strikes, three tries in the tenth frame if you spare or strike, etc.) Controls in Milo\'s Astro Lanes are very straightforward. The A button throws your ball down the lane, while the B button cycles through available power-ups, and the R button is used to zoom in on the pins (in case the in-game graphics are too blurry, and no I\'m not kidding). The control stick is used to move an arrow that determines the strength and hook desired on each throw. All in all, the game is a snap to learn. There are also ""puzzle"" bonus lanes that Milo and his cohorts will need to pass in order to move forward. These puzzles are one-frame games where you will need to take down all the pins within three tries. Bonus lanes also help you accumulate power-ups, which is Milo\'s Astro Lanes\' most important offering to the bowling genre. Versus and practice modes are also available, and each is fairly self-explanatory.

Fan support was way down and many teams went bankrupt. A new game had to be created. Thus, Super Baseball 2020 was born. Since then, America\'s pastime has never looked the same. Basically, Super Baseball is just that -- baseball with a different set of rules to make it more enjoyable to fans. The players now wear armor and can even upgrade it to make them play better. Also, women and robots now take the field. Keep an eye on those robots, though. They\'ll run out of fuel if you\'re not careful. There are 12 teams to choose from, with six in each of the two leagues. Some of the rules changes include an adjustment to the foul lines, a home run zone (deep center field only) and -- perhaps most excitingly -- ""crackers."" After certain innings, robot umpires will place these mine-like apparatuses on the field. If one of your fielders steps on a cracker, he, she, or it won\'t be in the best of shape. Some elements of Super Baseball 2020 remain the same as traditional baseball. There are still nine innings in one game, each with three outs. And it\'s still ""one, two, three strikes you\'re out"" at the old (err . . . new) ballgame.']","by

PITFALL 3D: Beyond The Jungle (Sony PlayStation),,"['Complete, includes disc, case, cover art, manuals and inserts.']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['PlayStation ~ Pitfall 3d: Beyond The Jungle (', 'It\'s really no wonder that Activision\'s created a modern PlayStation version of Pitfall, the ""Indiana Jones for the people"" game that probably best defined Activision\'s initial efforts as a company way back in the days of the Atari 2600. Yes, Pitfall Harry is back once again, or his son rather, and there\'s a world that needs saving. There are scorpions, pits, rolling logs, and vines in it, but the trees are now gone and it\'s all somehow turned 3D on him. <P>The story sees Harry entering an otherly dimensional world that\'s being enslaved by an evil being called The Scourge, who\'s changing all the world\'s magical energy from good to bad. The general gameplay consists of avoiding falling boulders, swinging from vines and chains, and leaping from floating, and sometimes crumbling, platforms - and every now and again, executing all of these while being chased by a monster. This may sound like fairly standard fare for a platform game, and it is, but Activision\'s got the timing down to an art (you have just enough time to plan your move and make it - no more, no less) and there\'s a complete lack of blind jumps - a frustrating bit that plagues most platformers. A nice showing of inventiveness and originality in its design shines through as well. <P>During the quest, you collect chips made up of a magic element known as lucense, which can be traded in at select points for a health recharge. You\'ll often come across lucense in its raw liquid form (blue is good, red is bad) spilled on the ground, which will cause your character to levitate above it. You can still control which direction you float in, but it\'s not easy and lends another dynamic to the gameplay. This is especially true in the first boss level, in which Harry must float up to and turn four different cranks, avoiding various obstacles and the blows of a huge gladiator who wades in the center of the lucense-filled room. Each turn fills the room with more liquid magic, but if you are too slow, the gladiator will turn them back and lower the level back to where you started. If you\'re quick to turn all four though, you\'ll drown your enemy in the deep blue.  <P>Each of the three boss levels has a different play mechanic and their even spacing throughout the game keeps the basic gameplay from growing monotonous. The first two boss scenarios are pretty fun (the second being a kind of twisted shooting gallery, where you have to hop over lava for your ammo), as is the rest of the game. But the last boss level, where you confront The Scourge, is kind of lackluster and seems somewhat anticlimactic compared with the others. The Scourge stage and some funky collision detection you\'ll notice throughout (which can sometimes help you but most of the time will frustratingly knock you off a ledge and get you killed) are Pitfall 3D\'s only really significant warts, though they do take away significantly from what\'s a really enjoyable game otherwise. <P>The visuals are good, the intelligent camera ensures your perspective is always perfect for what you need to accomplish, and the enemies are uniquely gruesome (from the monster dog Bornswags to the graphically impressive flaming Fire Djinns). The soundtrack is also quite dynamic and very fitting of an adventure game, and the voiceover comments of Bruce Campbell are thankfully few and far between, keeping them from getting too annoying. <P>There\'s also a lot to explore in Pitfall 3D. Each level has ten gold bars (each worth ten chips of lucense) and at least several bonus lives hidden just a little off the beaten path. The levels are also set up in a nonlinear fashion, which is great because if you have a problem carrying off one of the stage\'s multiple objectives, you can simply try another. This is pretty unlike most platformers - wherein if you\'re stuck, you\'re stuck - and it seems to encourage exploration. <P>While not perfect, Pitfall 3D is a fresh and original platform game in many ways, not the least of which is that it looks nothing like Super Mario 64, Tomb Raider, or Crash Bandicoot. Most importantly though, it\'s almost as fun as the original Pitfall was way back on the Atari 2600, and that\'s still pretty significant praise. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

That\'s the premise of Pumpkin Studios\' real-time strategy game Warzone 2100, which was developed for both the PC and PlayStation, though it\'s been made more ""actioney"" for the console.  <P>The basics of any real-time strategy game - you build factories and other structures that harvest natural resources so you can create more structures, units, and machines - are all observed here. You begin your game by setting up a base camp and clearing scavengers completely out of the surrounding area. Once the area is fully yours, you send troops on away missions via an air transport to explore other environments and search for artifacts of the past, so your scientists can research ""new"" technology. Later, you invoke the wrath of hostile forces that don\'t appreciate your poking around in their backyards, and then you must defend your home operations against them. Having a base camp to send missions away from as well as defend invests you considerably in the story and world, much like building your own island town in Konami\'s Suikoden. <P>That\'s only one of the things to like about Warzone 2100. The best thing is its high level of customizability. You can assemble more than 2,000 unique vehicles from basic building blocks and then instruct those units using more than two dozen different commands, such as attack, defend, patrol, pursue. You can also command your units to retreat after sustaining light, medium, or heavy damage. You\'ll often ignore the more complex commands, since you use a joystick to input them with instead of a keyboard, but the saving grace is that the units are smart enough to defend themselves, attack the enemy, or repair broken down structures or vehicles if the situation absolutely requires it. <P>Units also become better shots, harder to kill, and more maneuverable as they gain combat experience, which can be passed on to later machine generations by recycling the veteran forces in your factories. Thus, your new troops aren\'t so green that they don\'t have time to use their snazzy new weapons before being wiped out. <P>Like many real-time strategy games on the console systems though, there are some fatal flaws. Unlike Command & Conquer: Red Alert: Retaliation, Warzone 2100 suffers not from being too difficult, but from possessing a woefully inappropriate time limit. Missions range from an hour-and-a-half to two hours long, which makes sense in some sorties, but in others it renders them unplayable. How many times would you be willing to spend two hours coming within merely minutes of reaching your goal, only to have the timer run out and your game wiped away? In W2100, the answer is not many, because like other RTS console games, it\'s missing a critical element of its PC brother: the ability to save anywhere. This creates a cycle where you\'ll have to start from scratch every time you take a wrong turn at some critical junction within a stage. It\'s perhaps the reality set by the constraints of the system, but one that could\'ve been made far less frustrating if the timer  weren\'t magnifying the point. There are a few more minor complaints that can be said about the game (the control is far from intuitive, and the camera can sometimes hide units from you), but the main problem is that a time clock shouldn\'t have been included in this war. It makes all the nice touches in the game world live on borrowed time. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Felony 11-79 - PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['There\'s an interesting racing game subgenre that\'s starting to emerge, one that seems to take more from Roger Corman\'s classic cult film Death Race 2000 and Single Trac\'s Mortal-Kombat-in-cars Twisted Metal than Sega\'s Daytona or Namco\'s Ridge Racer. It\'s probably best referred to as the ""moving violation"" class, where body count takes precedence over time trials and property damage over pole position. The contenders so far include Interplay\'s Carmageddon (Death Race 2000 in all but name), DMA Design\'s self-explanatory Grand Theft Auto, and the first out the console gate, ASCII\'s Felony 11-79. <P>The title revolves around a mystical statue that\'s been broken into a dozen fragments and spread across three modern-day towns. Your character has been hired to retrieve the pieces by a wealthy so-and-so who has questionable plans for it. To do this, you must drive through three different areas (Downtown, several blocks of a Chinatown-esque setting; Sea Side, a stretch of road resembling the Pacific Coast highway; and Metro City, a congested Paris-like strip), picking up the items and making good on your getaway before the allotted time runs out. <P>Besides this main goal, you also try to wreak as much havoc as possible on your surroundings, without rendering your car totally inoperable. You are awarded monetary compensation for each fence, bicycle, telephone booth, or vehicle destroyed along the way, though admittedly the payoff seems more slanted toward owner karma than actual blue-book value. For example, demolishing a sports car will give you $10,000, while a minivan, cab, or police car will provide $15, $30, or $50,000, respectively. Unlike Interplay\'s Carmageddon, pedestrians are off-limits - though it\'s possible to chase them about, making them hop and scream to your heart\'s content. This Pulp Fiction-like moral gait is also reflected in the game\'s excellent Dick Dale-style surf rock soundtrack, that hip-gyrating, bad-boy music. <P>The game perspective within Felony can be toggled back and forth between a behind-the-car view and a first-person outlook, and the world you\'ll see isn\'t all that dissimilar to the third stage of Fox Interactive\'s Die Hard Trilogy. While adequate, the graphics aren\'t quite up to the standard set in DHT, as you can at times see that the building fronts are just that - 2D paper-thin walls with nothing but empty space behind them. <P>Yes, as you might imagine, Felony 11-79 is full of good, dumb fun. Unfortunately, it\'s over far too quickly. Even playing through with each of the four basic vehicles (Jeep, coupe, compact, and Vespa) and discovering the several hidden paths (an alleyway, subway, and through-mall shortcut), gamers can easily finish the title within two hours. Now, how well you drive your rides may open up one or more of the 18 hidden vehicles, which range from race car to police car to garbage truck to tank?!! Granted that\'s a lot of variety of control, speed, and armor, but I\'d gladly trade at least 16 of them to have just one more track. Perhaps a better name for this title would be ""Perfect Rental."" --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Auto Destruct - PlayStation,,"['1 Player', 'Rated ""T"" (13+)', 'Playstation One']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Very fun drive/shooter game!', 'Electronic Arts\' Auto Destruct is one of several games currently vying for the automotive combat crown currently held by Sony\'s Twisted Metal 2: World Tour. While Activision\'s Vigilante 8, Interplay\'s Crime Killer, and Sony\'s own Twisted Metal 3 are promising hopefuls, Auto Destruct doesn\'t even threaten to come close. <P>The storyline borrows as much from Marvel Comics\' The Punisher as it does from the old David Hasselhoff TV series, Knight Rider. The antics of an ""extreme terror cult"" have caused the death of your entire family, and the cultists haven\'t stopped there. They\'ve moved along, wreaking even more havoc in a future San Francisco (ostensibly shaken nearly flat by quakes between now and then). A mysterious organization called Temple has given you a sports car outfitted with weapons to stop them. <P>As Booth, the driver, you follow the instructions given to you via radio from your Temple operative. Your perspective is from behind the wheel, behind the car, or far above and behind the car, whichever you prefer. A typical mission includes picking up an informant and dropping him off at a safe location, tracking down and destroying enemy tanks and helicopters, escorting a VIP, or a mixture of them all. You can repair damage to your car and refill on gas at special stations in each of the three cities within the game and stock up on different weapons (machine guns, missiles, and mines for example), which are dropped off by friendly helicopters. <P>What follows is a very anal retentive action-adventure, meaning that instead of driving around shooting things and generally having a ball, you\'re stuck carrying out tedious objectives that must be met to the letter or else the whole thing\'s called off. While this is nothing new to mission-based games, it\'s this sort of ""go here, do this, get that, OK, you screwed that up, start over"" quality that helped drag down Psygnosis\' somewhat similar flying/shooting title G Police, and does so again here. <P>What Auto Destruct lacks in gameplay, it almost begins to make up for visually. The graphics look very similar to the Die Hard With A Vengeance portion of Probe\'s classic Die Hard Trilogy. The colors are bright and the buildings have a slightly better sense of depth than in titles such as Twisted Metal 2: World Tour and Die Hard Trilogy. These rather dated examples and lots of repeat in the building fronts make the graphics less impressive, but overall the game looks decent. The first-person view is good looking and fast moving, and the New York cityscape has a great design and color scheme, but the former isn\'t really playable within and the latter is late enough in the game that most players will give up before getting to it. <P>There are 25 missions of play in all. It\'s an impressive number, but much less so when one considers just how repetitive and dull the gameplay is. Auto Destruct could\'ve been a modernized city-based version of Midway\'s Spy Hunter, but it ended up as a G Police that got grounded. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Armored Core 2: Project Phantasma - PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Instead of being a full-blown sequel, From Software\'s Armored Core: Project Phantasma is the closest thing to an add-on pack the Sony PlayStation has ever seen. On the PC side, add-on packs are fairly popular because folks can get new missions, enemies, and options for their favorite games, without having to wait out the basic one- to two-year development cycle. Sure, the graphics, controls, and gameplay are basically the same, but add-ons provide what everyone essentially wants from a good game: more. <P>And that\'s what AC: PP is all about. You\'re still a member of a mercenary organization of mech robot pilots know as Ravens, who hire out their services to the highest bidder. You can still configure your mech by choosing which head, core, arms, legs, generator, FCS (the computer brain of the rig), arm and back weapons, and optional parts you want it to have. And you still need to accomplish a number of high-risk missions to be able to afford the choicer ones among them. There are just more missions and parts to be found now. <P>The original Armored Core saw players taking on such tasks as clearing squatters out of buildings, testing out experimental robots in battle, guarding trains, and destroying computer mainframes. There were nearly 50 missions in all, and branching pathways varied the storyline a bit and increased its replayability (at least if you gave up and started over before beating the game, since everything opened up once you finished it). In Armored Core: Project Phantasma, things are a little different. There are only 17 missions total, which doesn\'t leave a lot of room for branching at all. In fact, there are only two areas where the game forks off, making the title\'s missions a much more linear experience than its predecessor\'s missions. However, the tasks can be pretty interesting and include escorting captured Raven to safety, wiping out a convoy, sneaking into a base to arrest an official, or working with a partner to wipe out enemy installations. These are a little deeper than some of the previous game\'s objectives, requiring more thought than merely ""Destroy!"" And with one false move, watch out, you don\'t get paid. <P>Besides the new missions, an arena mode has been added to the game. In the first Armored Core, the player had to work his way up the ranks of the top ten rated Ravens by either coming up against them while on assignment or achieving a high success ratio. Now, it\'s much more straightforward: You can simply call out the mech who ranks above you for a duel in one of 13 different environments of your choice. There\'s a decent amount of variety among the whopping 49 different Ravens, and they most assuredly get really tough towards the end. But it\'s all good since cash and/or parts are awarded to the winner, and repair costs are waived either way. A replay mode is also provided, from which you can watch the preceding battle from your perspective, the computer player\'s, or from a third-person view above both. While it sounds like a minor gimmick, it sometimes helps to see just how your opponent took you down, so it doesn\'t get a chance to do it again. And if you still have your save-game data from the first Armored Core, loading it up will allow you to shoot your way up the ranks much faster. Unfortunately, whether from a save or from scratch, this mode can get rather repetitive after a while. <P>While the missions are fun and there\'s still something to be said for the duels, Armored Core: Project Phantasma can be beaten within the space of two or three days, meaning there simply isn\'t quite enough here to justify the cost of purchase. Hardcore AC fans might want to pick it up, but others should be able to get by with a rental. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Brand new players with specific faces and the most detailed arenas ever seen. World famous Mike Emrick provides the play-by-play and ESPN's Darren Pang covers the color commentary."", ""While Face Off 99 is clearly an improvement over the last Face Off, it still falls short of EA's NHL 99. The game has great graphics, sound, and fairly decent control, but the game's one-dimensional AI becomes so boring to play against that you'll quickly move on. <P>Face Off 99 has all the features you would expect from a hockey game. It has the NHL official license, so it has all of the real NHL teams and players, including the expansion teams. You can trade players, release players, create a player, and sign free agents.  <P>The player models and animations have been totally redone this year to give them more of a realistic look. The animations are quite good, especially the new goalie animations that feature tons of different save animations. Visual effects such as multiple player shadows and lights that reflect off the ice give the game a polished look. In line with the improved visuals, the arenas have all been revamped to show details such as championship banners, flags, and lights hanging from the ceiling. The ice can be viewed from five camera angles: ice level, vertical, high vertical, diagonal, and side. While most of the camera angles appear to be too close or too far, you'll eventually get used to the default. Next year, 989 Studios should just include a user-adjustable camera. <P>In the audio department, Face Off 99 does a pretty good job. Mike Emrick provides the play-by-play and ESPN2's Darren Pang adds the color commentary. They call the action just as it happens on the ice, which is amazing since the action on the ice happens at an unbelievably fast pace. The game also includes the usual crowd noise, arena announcer, and sound effects. <P>Face Off 99 supports the Dual Shock analog controller, which makes for a smoother feel when you're skating around on the ice. It also vibrates when you take a hit or check someone else, giving you more of a connection to the action on the ice. Overall, the control is a little loose whether you're using the digital pad or analog stick. Passing, regardless of which method you use, is very effective. Two new gameplay features that are welcome additions are on-the-fly defensive play-calling and icon player-switching. During the action you can change your defensive formation by simply hitting two buttons. In addition, on defense you can now hit a button to become a specific player on the ice. The AI of the computer-controlled players is weak. Your teammates have a problem with properly setting up for a one-timer. When on offense, the computer follows nearly the same game plan regardless of which team it's playing as or what difficulty setting the game is on. The computer-controlled team sets up for a shot and then simply tries to crash the net over and over again. The computer also sometimes passes the puck to a man in the corner of the rink who is apparently waiting for one of his teammates to get open but just kind of stands there. He doesn't try to move out of the way but instead simply lets you mug him. He eventually passes the puck if you let him stand there long enough.   <P>Overall, NHL Face Off 99 is a much better game than last year's, which is great for fans of the series. However, for true fans of video game hockey who are simply out to get the most realistic and enjoyable hockey game currently available, NHL 99 is easily the better choice. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Mass Destruction,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Mass Destruction is ASC Games' aptly named mission-based tank shooting game. You hop in one of three tanks and take on 24 different missions, each with its own set of objectives. During the course of the game, you pick up tons of different weapons and blow the hell out of anything that gets in your way. <P>The missions are fairly simple. There's usually some kind of military installation, and you've got to destroy it. Standing in your way is an army's worth of tanks, infantry, flamethrowers, bunkers, buildings, turrets, and helicopters. You must complete all the primary and secondary objectives and make your way to the extraction zone. Then it's on to the next mission for more of the same. While this may sound incredibly tedious, the sheer amount of destruction and death caused in each level keeps the game interesting, and the varied terrain (snow, desert, etc.) helps to keep the game fresh. <P>The graphics in Mass Destruction are quite good. Everything is rendered polygonally, from the tanks to the buildings to even the satellite dishes. A few things look a bit blocky, but it still looks pretty neat. The game moves very quickly, without a hint of slowdown, even when the entire screen is seemingly on fire. The sound is also really good. Explosions and gunfire sound very realistic, and the screams of troops as you run them over is a really nice touch. <P>Above all, Mass Destruction is good, clean fun.

Extreme violence and non-stop action make this a must-have game for fans of the original."", ""Reloaded takes the original concept of Loaded, namely hard-core killing and gore, and takes it outdoors. Unfortunately, this isn't an improvement. When it comes down to it, Reloaded (actually, the entire Loaded series) is a horrible version of the Atari classic, Gauntlet - the main difference being the enemies. Instead of Gauntlet's massive, unstoppable swarms, Reloaded places a few green guys here and there, and then tosses in the occasional gun emplacement (to get your hopes up). Unfortunately, the gameplay never improves, meaning Reloaded is delivered to the Playstation DOA. <P>The top-down perspective from Loaded has been tweaked a little for this sequel, giving it more of a 3-D feel. The new look can cause problems, however, such as not knowing which parts of the level the player's character can walk on, and which parts are of a different elevation can or can't be reached. The graphics, while now rendered instead of sprite-based, are still quite bad and very pixelated, save the occasionally nice-looking blood splotch on the ground after ventilating an enemy. <P>In terms of gameplay, Reloaded also adds specific tasks that must be accomplished in order to complete a mission. In one, the hero-psychopath must collect three grubs and give them to a hippie before he'll fix the bridge, thus allowing the hero to pass. Accomplishing this task means the player must wander around the landscape, unsure of which hills can be scaled and which ones are too steep, looking for small green things on the ground. How exciting. Sometimes the mission objective isn't so clear, and simply walking down the correct path ends the level. Needless to say, this feature makes for some frustrating moments. <P>Titles like Reloaded make me want to sell all of my worldly possessions and hit the open road in order to get as far away from video games as possible. This is truly a gimmick offering: Take away the blood 'n' guts and all that's left is a pathetic excuse for a game, 32-bit or otherwise. Quite literally, stay away from Reloaded at all costs. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Beautifully rendered characters and backgrounds. Tons of fighters each with their own unique abilities and personalities. The first fighting game where you can create and train your own fighter!"", ""Deadly Arts is a bandwagon-hopping 3D fighting game from Konami. While it has one or two interesting modes, the gameplay is incredibly generic, and the character design is completely drab. <P>Where Deadly Arts differs from other 3D fighters is in its create-a-fighter option. The option is surprisingly full-featured when compared with the rest of the game. You can pick from various hairstyles, body shapes, heights, and faces when dealing with your fighter's appearance. Once finished, you pick one of the stock characters to fight against. As you win, you'll be able to learn moves from the other fighters, eventually piecing together the best moves from each of the other characters. The other interesting mode is the tag mode, where you form a three-person team. You can switch characters at any time, but just like baseball, once you take a guy out, he's out for the rest of the match. <P>The game plays similarly to Virtua Fighter, in that you have punch, kick, block, and evade buttons. The combo system is fairly simplistic, allowing people to pound on one button and get two or three hits. You can also strike opponents when they're down. If time runs out, various scores are tabulated, and the score leader, rather than the energy leader, wins. <P>The characters in Deadly Arts lack life. They all reek of the cookie-cutter character design common in second- and third-tier fighters. Also, the character animation is really lackluster. The game's graphics are very plain, and the stages can cause quite a bit of slowdown, especially when they have to use foreground transparencies to keep the characters visible. <P>Deadly Arts is just too basic. It doesn't have any truly distinguishing characteristics, and the gameplay just isn't interesting in any way. Don't waste your time or money on this one. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Imperium Galactica 2: Alliances - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>Imperium Galactica 2: Alliances</i> is epic empire-building action. Conquer space and reign supreme with the most massive real-time strategy game ever. <i>Imperium Galactica 2: Alliances</i> features four full discs worth of intergalactic imperial warfare and three unique playable races, providing hundreds of hours of interstellar game play.', '<i>Imperium Galactica 2: Alliances</i> gives you total control over a huge and incredibly detailed galaxy. Discover new planets and colonize them--or conquer them. Govern your people on stunningly detailed 3-D planet surfaces. Open diplomatic channels with several weird alien races, or order your spies to infiltrate the alien governments and steal their secret technology.', ""mperium Galactica II is a highly enjoyable science-fiction real-time strategy game of conquest and exploration that excels in its presentation and interface design, as well as in the quality of its single-player scenarios. The game is innovative and good-looking, and it provides many hours of fun. But it has a broad scope, and as such, Imperium Galactica II could have been handled better in particular areas. Still, the game's strong points easily overshadow these shortcomings."", ""Imperium Galactica II features an interface that lets you manage complicated tasks simply and quickly. Specifically, its presentation of pertinent information eliminates many of the tedious aspects of maintaining an empire, and it provides a template for incorporating many options and features while keeping them manageable. For example, essential information about the planets under your control - such as population, growth rate, and production status - is clearly displayed in thumbnail windows. These can be expanded to provide more detailed information such as income, tax rate, and morale. Finally, you can zoom down to the surface to make more specific changes to the colony's auto-build. With this hierarchy of information, you can control your empire more efficiently and concentrate on more important matters."", ""The interface also has a stylish presentation. The research menu displays a rotating wireframe of your project gradually becoming more defined as you progress in its development. When you select an agent from the spying menu, you'll see an animated sequence zoom in to show that agent's profile and statistics. The game's attention to aesthetic detail makes it more enjoyable to play overall."", ""Imperium Galactica II's combat interface is similarly user-friendly, as it provides a simple options console that contains rotate, zoom, and scroll keys surrounding a perspective-oriented minimap. There's also a time bar, so you can pause to queue up orders as well as speed up the fight when victory is assured. Moreover, before entering a space battle, you can group your fleet into one of ten formations. This option facilitates strategy because it decreases the time required to execute such tactics as flanking, escorting, surrounding, feinting, and full frontal assault and instead lets you focus on performing these sorts of maneuvers rather than merely setting them up. As a result, the battles can be more exciting because you can implement dynamic ship maneuvers and tactics easily."", 'Early in Imperium Galactica II, battles involve dozens of fighters and a few destroyers or corvettes. Fighters cannot be micromanaged well, so these types of skirmishes are more fun to watch than to play. Midway through the game, battles become more involving and exciting. In this stage of the game, you have large capital-ship technology but relatively mediocre beam weapons. Consequently, strategy is largely based on attacking and defending against crude but powerful torpedoes. Of course, you can install more powerful beam weapons on your ship, but the slow fire rate will significantly decrease your ability to defend against fighters.', ""For example, an effective strategy when attacking an enemy fleet of battleships with cruisers and destroyers is to first set the fleet formation to flank. You then queue your cruisers to zigzag to avoid the battleships' torpedoes and let your ships attack with their lasers. Meanwhile, you send your destroyers to launch their own torpedoes point blank to the enemies. If the enemy fleet turns to deal with the destroyers, the enemy should be occupied long enough for your cruisers to turn and accurately torpedo the battleships. If the enemy stays with the cruisers, the more maneuverable destroyers should achieve a good number of hits."", 'When defending against large numbers of fighters with capital ships, you can group your ships into a sphere to concentrate the laser fire. You can also escort your fleet with a small group of fighters to draw fire and cause the attacking fighters to miss more.', 'Unfortunately, strategy is minimal later in the game. When every race is attacking each other with battleships and mobile bases, there is no reason to move - your ships will fire with greater frequency and accuracy if they remain motionless. There is no reason to zigzag, because more advanced torpedoes track their targets effortlessly. Building destroyer- and corvette-class ships is rarely time-efficient or cost-effective, because they cannot house enough firepower, and enemy battleships and cruisers can destroy them in a few shots. Moreover, fighters are ineffective against any ship larger than a heavy corvette, so they are effectively phased out.', ""However, when your ships are still, you have time to observe and appreciate the game's excellent graphics. All the vessels are detailed and well designed. The only shortcoming is the lack of ship animation; the ships have no origin of fire, such as a turret, torpedo tube, or laser bank - instead, all weapon effects manifest themselves some distance away from the hull. Ships explode dramatically, but there's no indication like flames or electrical discharges when they're damaged. Shields aren't animated either, as they're represented only as a colored bar above the unit. Lastly, the variation in gunfire effects is minimal. Different guns may shoot different-colored beams of different lengths, but none of them are particularly impressive. For instance, the quad laser doesn't actually shoot four lasers, and even if you install four quad lasers you'll still see one beam onscreen."", 'The ground battles look a little more detailed - tanks with rocket turrets look different from those with cannon turrets, for example. However, unlike in space conflicts, in ground battles the side with the greater number of units most often decides the battle. You can choose the location of your drop zone, but you cannot set the aggressiveness of your tanks or employ formations. As a result, complex maneuvers, such as those you would expect in any real-time strategy game, are difficult and often impractical.', ""Still, Imperium Galactica II does present other options than just destroying the defending tanks and gun emplacements. For example, you can destroy undefended factories and power plants to cripple the enemy planet's production, and then retreat. You can also destroy enough power plants to deactivate the defending laser fortresses, then commence your attack."", ""Not only does Imperium Galactica II look good and play well, but it also succeeds at creating a unique universe, featuring eight interesting races. Within each campaign, multiple side-missions are randomly generated. For example, leaders will often ask you to take sides in a war. A newly discovered civilization will ask you for asylum from their oppressors, while the oppressors will offer you a reward if you eliminate the defectors for them. These side-missions are fun, but unfortunately they rarely affect your empire significantly. They only serve to make the game more interesting and provide a way to earn a few thousand more credits in reward money. Nevertheless, these missions help reduce the generally repetitive nature of having to maintain your empire, just as they increase the game's replay value."", ""The video sequences are another good feature of Imperium Galactica II's campaigns. The characters are well rendered, and they have expressive body language along with excellent voice-acting. You meet multiple interesting characters from side missions, but most originate from your large complement of advisors, such as your fleet admiral, tank commanders, scientists, and planetary governors. You can even interview mercenaries as candidates to command your fleet, and you can ask them about their background, skills, and desired salary."", ""As for the campaigns themselves, they let you play as three different races: the Solarians, Kra'hen, and Shinari, which represent the archetypes of being good, evil, and greedy, respectively. The human, or Solarian, campaign, deals with retrieving data crystals that may contain information that could make the Solarian Empire invincible. The sole objective of the Kra'hen campaign is for the Kra'hen to expand their empire and kill all those who oppose. Lastly, the Shinari is a merchant race that seeks to exploit the other civilizations to make profit. Imperium Galactica II also has several dynamic scenarios that explore specific conflicts of all the game's eight races. They don't provide much information about the races, but they are both exciting and challenging to play."", ""Indeed, the campaign and scenarios provide few insights about your race and other races' identity, history, or nature. This is especially disappointing since the races seem so intriguing. The manual gives brief descriptions of each, but you'll learn little else after the campaign is completed. For example, a race called the Toluen are described as being the result of failed genetic experiments, resulting in an unnatural oversecretion of pheromones. The consequences are obvious, as the manual humorously presents them as ambulatory blobs with tentacles. We learn why and by whom the Toluen were created, but learn nothing of their culture, achievements, or history."", ""Similarly, the designers provided each race with unique ship designs, but they failed to provide the races with unique buildings or technologies. No race-specific technologies, ships, or tanks exist. Furthermore, all eight technology trees are identical and linear. As a result, no major research decisions are required, which diminishes the game's replay value."", ""It's equally disappointing that your diplomacy options are limited and identical for each race. For example, you can only ask your enemy to make peace through one short statement, and each race will ask you for peace using that same statement. There is no race-specific dialogue or typeface for the onscreen text."", 'Combat chatter also suffers from the same deficiencies. It is repetitive, as it\'s the same for all units and not race-specific. Furthermore, the chatter is often inaccurate or inapplicable. Your fleet will often report that an enemy ship or tank is listing, even though such a description is irrelevant in zero gravity and meaningless when referring to land vehicles. Your ships will often report ""We think we\'re gonna die"" even when the enemy has no chance of success. And upon victory, your ships will shout ""Who\'s the daddy?"" instead of using the proper expression.', 'While these shortcomings are significant, they should be taken more as wasted opportunities than as flaws. In spite of them, Imperium Galactica II should prove be extremely entertaining for fans of real-time strategy or other space conquest games, because it provides an exciting depth of play thanks to its many well-developed features, as well as its great graphics and campaigns. <br />--<i>Copyright 2000 GameSpot Inc.

Alexi Lalas International Soccer,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""When it comes to fast and physical soccer look no further than Alexi Lalas International Soccer where you'll have to be quicker and tougher than the best international teams in the world to grab the cup!"", 'Recent strides in soccer video gaming rescued the world\'s favorite game from its previous status as one of the world\'s least favorite video games. Now we have all sorts of individual control options, like crazy banana kicks and wacky scissor-stepping footwork. Tactical options, through pass plays, and offsides traps have opened up a level of strategy to the aspiring video striker previously witnessed only in football games. And, slowly but surely, soccer games\' AI has come up to speed. Play is faster and more challenging than ever before. But none of this can be said about Alexi Lalas International Soccer, a game threatening to send soccer back to the dark ages. <P>Graphically, ALI Soccer is competent, though not particularly stunning. A handful of camera angles are available, although most are too tight for safe passing. Though free of polygon dropout and substantial flickering, the players in ALI Soccer look unfinished. Not that EA\'s FIFA games for the PlayStation render the most solid flesh-and-blood athletes - on the N64 and the PC their ""wholeness"" is alarming. Rather, the animation in the FIFA titles is so lifelike, and there are so many glorious special moves - from simple flick passes to savage sliding tackles to unbelievable diving saves - by comparison ALI Soccer seems lackluster and out of date. Control on offense is passable (no pun intended). Again, don\'t expect dozens of trick moves or much tactical variety. A couple of basic plays are available on the fly - the offsides draw works pretty well - but the game is without the strategic possibilities of, say, World Cup 98. Defense is more awkward. Sliding tackles are pretty useless. The most effective defensive tactic seems to be to repeatedly tap the triangle button, which according to the manual does nothing, yet somehow manages to get the ball back. Goalie control is worse. Once your goalie has possession of the ball, you can\'t kick it back into play - despite what the manual says. Your only option is to throw it to one of two (count \'em: two) receivers. Needless to say, this is a precarious set of options at best, and more often than not possession is turned right over to an enemy forward for an easy shot on goal. <P>Worst of all is the game\'s weak AI, especially its control of non-ball carriers. Most of the time it\'s as though you were completely alone out there. Send your halfback sprinting back to defend against an enemy fast break and nine times out of ten, you arrive on the scene to find your fullbacks standing stock still as your opponent\'s forwards charge toward the goal. Suddenly, as though recovering from some mass hypnosis, they spring to life simultaneously. They should have used texture-mapped rotting flesh instead of jerseys because the CPU-controlled players behave more like the undead than the real-life players of 70 professional teams. Some of the usual options are present in ALI Soccer. The game offers tournament play and friendly matches, but no weird shootout games or practice modes. It has day and night play, but no weather. Players can be placed in varying formations, but there are no customizable stats. The game\'s voice-overs are totally repetitive, often loading the same sample multiple consecutive times and sounding more like a broken record than live color. <P>Alexi Lalas International Soccer is a painful soccer game. It offers neither the stunning animations, nor the tactical depth, nor the ease of control of any recent soccer title. Beyond that, the AI is downright infuriating. Even the die-hard soccer fan will want to skip this one. --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Iggy's Reckin' Balls,,['n64'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"[""You've never seen any game like this. This genre busting game is fast paced and action packed. It can be described as a sort of video game version of king of the mountain. Be very careful with this game! It is extremely addictive! With over 100 levels and five modes of play this ground breaking title will make Iggy a household name."", ""Game developers seem to be under the impression that fans of the puzzle genre, and to benefit the analogy, we might as well throw in the driving genre, too, are the types who'd actually attempt to dig their way out of prison with the blunt end of a toothbrush. Why? Call it attention span; call it stubbornness. For better or worse, the games tend to be loaded with sick, addictive tasks that no matter how much you try to hate them, you can't even walk away from them. Acclaim's Iggy's Reckin' Balls for the N64 is no exception."", ""Iguana's bizarre puzzle/racing/platform game isn't particularly difficult. In fact, some of the challenges are downright easy. However, the game is fairly steep, with four modes of play, about ten levels in each (including hidden ones), with about ten towers of difficulty in each one of the levels."", ""There are eight main characters available immediately, with nine hidden ones you open up later. These game personalities are balls with faces. That's right, including a room-temperature-cool Iggy, a cooing strange female with a bow, a large grinning thing, a pumpkin, and others. They're fairly ineffectual as characters, but fortunately, they're not developed enough to be ingratiatingly annoying - actually, ignoring them becomes pretty easy once you start cracking levels."", ""It's with one of these characters that you enter into one of four modes. In arcade mode, you race up to three other CPU opponents or humans in one of five open levels or five hidden levels, once you unlock them. There are ten stages of difficulty, known as towers, within each level. Beat one, you move on to the next, and so on. When the race starts, you move to the top of the vertical, spiraling course by climbing to the plank above you or adjacent to you by grappling with your tongue. Some sections of the track you can't grab on to, so you'll need to race along horizontally until you find a clearing or a grabable surface. Now the cool thing is, you can actually grapple your opponents as well. Someone getting ahead of you? No sweat. Stick out your tongue and whip him around a few times. You can make some time while he recovers. You're also equipped with jumping ability, a turbo, and the benefits of any of the power-ups you gather along the way, such as little bombs you can leave for your enemies or a destructive energy ball that seeks them out while you progress through the course. But some of these power-ups do nasty things to you as well, like make you really small and slow or reverse your controls. And one big, huge frustrating thing to have happen is to run out of turbos before you're at the end of the course. While there's plenty of bounding from trampolines and grappling from plank to plank, the sections of track between the areas you can grab onto are awfully far apart if you can't zip to them quickly with your turbo. Since you only have a limited amount, you have to use them very wisely or else go crazy, especially in the longer towers."", 'Another mode is the mix-up or create-your-own-championship challenge. This is actually pretty fun, especially in multiplayer. You select the ten levels you want to play, as well as the tower within that level, hence tailoring the difficulty and progression of difficulty to your liking. For example, you could set the championship up to begin in The Deep, Tower 5, and then make it easier by choosing Easy Street, Tower 1 to go next, and then make it difficult again by choosing Candyland, Tower 10 for the next one and so on. And once those are selected, the challenge is the standard race to the top before the other guys within each level.', ""The time-trial mode challenges you to beat the best time for each level on your own or go up against human opponents. This is actually more difficult than the other modes, as well as frustrating. If you want to challenge your friends, the versus, or head-to-head mode and the other modes are much more interesting, with the exception of the battle mode. In this one, you select the level you want to battle in, and then race around as you would navigate the race or time-trial mode, using power-ups and grappling to destroy your opponents. Every character trails three colored balls behind him or her. When all three disappear from taking hits, you lose. It seemed as if the battles would be the most enjoyable of the Iggy's options, largely due to what we've come to expect from N64 multiplayer challenges. However, they're too chaotic and over far too quickly to be half the challenge they ought to be."", 'In the competitive modes besides battle and time trial, you collect a cumulative number of points for each lap (the number varies in each tower), for each tower, in each level. If you win first, second, or third, you\'ll get a ""secret technique"" or a tip. The problem is, the tips usually come in the form of something you figured out long ago enabling you to get to a winning spot in the first place. But if you\'re really good, you\'ll at least start opening hidden characters and levels, so there is something to strive for.', ""Graphically, Iggy's is pretty decent. With levels to the likes of Candyland, the potential for a graphical nightmare seemed rather high. But the levels are clear, well designed, and easy to find your way around - unless you're one of those people who gets lost stepping off elevators, which in this case, it wouldn't be the developer's fault. Also, the camera works with you. From a third-person perspective, you can almost always see exactly where you need to be, quite a while before you get there. A couple of the jumps were somewhat blind, but in the case where the direct path wasn't discernable, a bit of patience would usually remedy the confusion, as a movable plank would eventually appear. Also, the blind turns were a lot like deliberate blind turns on a roller coaster track. Usually when you couldn't see too far around the bend, you really didn't have to worry, as the course would straighten out or send you to a teleportation area before you had to react on your own."", 'The music is typical puzzle music, yet not as moody and ambient as in other N64 puzzle titles Wetrix and Tetrisphere. But it\'s downright symphonic as compared with the miserable little character voices - more car commercial-sounding actors attempting to utter words like ""dude"" with feeling.', ""So for all Iggy's trademark puzzle-game annoyances, it also has the perks, such as the element, perhaps never formally defined, that makes these monotonous, redundant, frustrating little games suck the very life out of gamers each time they arrive in stores. Fans of multiplayer puzzle games will probably have a lot of fun with this title, and for solitary puzzlers, it's also fun, but you may be best served with Tetrisphere or Wetrix. --Lauren Fielder <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Dual Shock compatible.', ""Compared with VR Sports' Power Boat Racing, Turbo Prop Racing is better in every possible way. But even still, the lack of innovative courses, boats, or gameplay still leaves video-game boat racing dead in the water. <P>Turbo Pro Racing has six unique tracks, which can be raced in mirror mode, or at nighttime for a little variation. There is a random track generator in the game, which you can unlock if you do well enough on the existing tracks. Unfortunately, all of the courses are so narrow and limited that they aren't any fun to race. You feel more like a rat in a maze than a boat racer. The game's two-player mode isn't bad; you can race one-on-one, or you and a friend can race along with all of the rest of the pack. You can decide whether you would like to race with the screen horizontal or vertical. <P>The control seems a bit unresponsive at first, but then, boats aren't exactly the tightest-controlling vehicles in the world. The regular controller really doesn't stand up to the Dual Shock here, mostly because of the vibration, though the analog control helps. But the little bit of freedom you gain when racing with the analog controller is stifled by the claustrophobic, narrow courses. <P>Visually, Turbo Prop Racing is fast. The water looks pretty good, but the boats and levels are quite plain. The game runs quickly, usually up around 60fps. The pop-up or level draw-in isn't terribly bad, as was the case with the visually dismal VR Sports Powerboat Racing. The sound effects and music in Turbo Prop Racing are actually pretty good. The hip-hop/techno music is a little reminiscent of the Wipeout soundtrack. <P>In the end, Turbo Prop Racing is just another racing game. If you're really, really into powerboat racing, you might find Turbo Prop Racing slightly appealing. If that's the case, rent it, but it really isn't worth buying. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Dynasty Warriors - PlayStation One video game,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Koei's first fighting game draws its source material from its classic Romance of the Three Kingdoms strategy game series. Based in 2nd Century China the baker's dozen combatants (including a trio of playable Bosses) in this 3D fighter are each comprised of at least 600 polygons while the game itself runs at a remarkable 60 fps! Koei assembled one of the all-time great development teams (a group of fighting game veterans dubbed the Omega Force Team) for this project and it shows."", ""These days, it's unlikely for a fighting game to burst onto the home console gaming market without being an arcade game adaptation...and be any good. Koei's Dynasty Warriors is a welcome exception to this rule.  <P>Say goodbye to the 20-hit combos and huge chain attacks of Takara's Battle Arena Toshinden 3 and Namco's Soul Blade; here's a game that provides a much more realistic take on fighting. The maximum number of hits a character can pull off before pausing (and probably breathing) is three. And when opponents are knocked to the ground, they're actually stunned for a moment, and you must force them to stand up again. <P>The combat in Dynasty Warriors is all weapon-based and contains no punches or kicks - some characters have swords, some knives, and others spears. Blocking takes two forms: a standard block and a parry. The standard block can be done through a dedicated button or by holding the D-pad in the back direction. These blocks are performed either standing or crouching and will only work against an attack at the same height. Because the fighting is done with weapons, no damage is taken if this block is successful. The parry, on the other hand, will deflect the opponent's weapon and leave him momentarily open to attack. However, parrying is not easy to master. You must hit the correct parry button (there are two) at the exact moment your enemy attempts to attack. It can take a frustratingly long time to learn the move, but it's most satisfying when it works. <P>Another interesting difference distinguishing Dynasty Warriors is the origins of its storyline. Its characters are taken from Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms line of strategy titles, which are based on real-life historical events and people. See, kids? History can be cool. Folks have been hitting each other on the head for thousands and thousands of years, and now, you too can join in the fictional yet nonfictional fun. <P>How does it compare to Takara's Battle Arena Toshinden 3 and Namco's Soul Blade? Well, it's really quite different from both, within the basic 2-D and 3-D constraints. The realism makes it a much more strategic fighter, though an overly dramatic game like Soul Blade can be at times more fun to play. Graphically, it clocks in around the first Tekken game with fairly impressively rendered fighters against static backgrounds. The characters react about as fast as the Soul Blade fighters, but their animations are not quite as well developed. References to other games aside, Dynasty Warriors is a solid fighter that many people will enjoy exploring fully. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Robotron X - PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Back when Run DMC was still rapping in the park and the Wu Tang Clan were sporting K-Swiss, Robotron 2084 was one of the best games around. Along with Defender and a few other games, Robotron 2084 took its place in the pantheon of video games. Programmed by Eugene Jarvis (who also worked on Defender and more recently Cruisin\' USA), Robotron 2084 not only had an awesome look (colorful and busy) but also an innovative control configuration. Instead of a joystick to move and a button to fire, 2084 had two joysticks: one to move and one to fire. This gave player his first taste of 360 degree simulated 3-D action. And luckily, Robotron X for the Playstation both retains these Eugene Jarvis innovations and ups the ante in terms of graphics and music. <P>The concepts from the original game are the same in Robotron X. Although all of the bad guys are 3-D rendered, and the playfield scrolls in and out (depending on where the hero is), not much else has changed in terms of gameplay. Using the four Playstation buttons for firing up, down, left, and right, and combining two buttons to reach the diagonals, the 360 shooting remains intact. Robotron X even includes bosses and bonus rounds for those players who complete the primary objective and rescue all family members. And with 100 levels to play, this game delivers a lot of play for the money - especially for players who are into somewhat repetitive arcade shooters. <P>A note on the game\'s music: Though the tunes are described as ""hard-core techno soundtracks,"" these songs are hardly hard-core and aren\'t that good. Other than this minor complaint, it looks like Williams has done well to go back to its roots, because this time it has come up with a winner. --Nikos Constant <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

In the process of thrashing through the concrete jungle you must pull off the most radical maneuvers to deliver on time. The cash you earn can be used to buy a better bike. Features over 250 kamikaze missions.', 'In Courier Crisis - GT Interactive\'s latest homage to slackers everywhere - you play a grunged-out bicycle messenger travelling at breakneck speeds through busy thoroughfares and crowded alleys. In the game, you will round corners at tremendous velocities, dodging oncoming traffic as you knee and elbow pedestrians into the road. You will even be afforded the opportunity to clear the entire height of a garbage truck in a single vault. A fantastic concept with endless possibility, but one that was executed so poorly here, even the most radical bunny-hop couldn\'t save the resultant product. <P>Courier Crisis seems to offer a lot from the outset, but a combination of elements makes the game a disappointment. Sure, you can hop on car hoods and bike around the game\'s 3D-rendered streets. Sure, you can you beat up police officers, run over helpless grandmas, and kick doggies. Sure, you can collect assets and purchase improved bikes after each mission. But your bicycle\'s sloth-like response to the controller will soon supplant the previous novelties with mere feelings of frustration. Compound this with boring levels and humor that tries way too hard, and this frustration is replaced with the act of pressing the ""off"" button on your PlayStation. <P>The graphics don\'t help the situation too much either. Blotchy, repetitive textures and jerky animation that is sorely in need of more frames characterizes each Chinatown street and Skid Row alley. Of course, this makes the exciting act of performing an aerial jump or table-top (different tricks award the cyclist with various power-ups) - or even recklessly slamming into an oncoming police car - less than exciting activities. <P>In the end, Courier Crisis is a game for people who are endlessly entertained by second-rate Beavis and Butthead-esque humor and wacky stunts, but not one for serious PlayStation gamers.

Pro Pinball: Playstation 1,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Finally a pinball game that goes beyond the arcade experience. The ultimate and most realistic pinball game ever created for the PlayStation. Play up to six balls simultaneous and play with up to six different views.', 'Pro Pinball is a good simulation of real pinball. However, a video pinball game should have two overriding features: It should do things that regular pinball can\'t do, and it should provide replay value by including numerous tables in one package. Unfortunately, Pro Pinball does neither. <P>The lone table, titled ""The Web,"" has the look and feel of many of today\'s pinball machines, and includes lots of bells and whistles, loops and combos, and a ball magnet. The only thing missing is the feel of the machine in your hands - the nudging controls don\'t come close to the real thing. Pro Pinball\'s rendered graphics look great, and the dot-matrix backglass animations are topnotch. The game also comes through in the sound department: The flippers, bumpers, and launchers all sound like they\'re on a real machine. The telltale replay ""thwack"" noise is even present. (Perhaps Interplay and Empire Interactive should have gone ahead and made a real pinball machine.) Unfortunately, the music is repetitive and ultimately detracts from the gameplay. Luckily, the music can be turned way down. <P>As for gameplay, the player must accomplish several different missions and tasks on The Web, with lots of scoring opportunities along the way. Pro Pinball provides six different table views. Unfortunately, they all have a similar perspective, and a 2-D, top-down view is conspicuous in its absence. Without this 2-D view, it\'s very difficult to judge exactly where to shoot the ball, though with a little practice making the ramps and loops isn\'t a problem. <P>Ultimately, this is a convincing simulation of pinball, but it falls short when compared to other video pinball games. A single table just doesn\'t provide enough extended replay value to put it ahead of the pack. Even with its shortcomings, pinball fans should give Pro Pinball a try - if for no other reason than console pinball games are few and far between. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

G-Darius,,"['Over 13 levels with 5 different endings', 'Variety of weapons and power-ups', '28 bosses', '2 player co-op mode']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Jump into a ship and defend the planet from mechanical fish in G DARIUS. Blast through 15 branching levels of action and excitement as you capture enemy ships, and use their special skills to help you work your way through every level. If the action becomes too intense, have a friend help you out with the cooperative Two-Player mode. Only you can save the world from becoming a fishbowl in G DARIUS.', 'The Darius series has never gained the respect it deserves in the US, and perhaps G Darius is the title that can turn that around. It\'s definitely one of the more bizarre shooter series. The premise behind Darius is simple - shoot the giant robotic fish. Yes, fish. As ludicrous as it sounds, the bounty of the sea is fighting back, and it\'s up to two Silver Hawk-brand fighter pilots to single-handedly save the universe from a slew of menacing crustaceans and cetaceans. <P>Despite the game\'s questionable tag line, ""You will see the creation of new lives,"" G Darius offers little more than the purest and most satisfying side-scrolling destruction. In addition to the upgradable lasers, missiles, and shields, you have a unique weapon at your disposal - the capture ball. Instead of the screen-clearing bombs of most shooters, G Darius gives you a supply of hypnotic orbs with which to ensnare the mechanical marine life. With a few exceptions, most standard enemies can be captured. More impressive, however, is the ability to capture the game\'s midbosses after inflicting a certain amount of damage. Following a successful capture, you have a number of options. <P>Most enemies form up alongside the Silver Hawk, acting like the Options of the Gradius days, firing with you. Other enemies have no attacks, simply protecting the ship. After playing a number of times, you will quickly find your favorite enemy types for handling a given situation, adding (god forbid) an element of strategy to the bullet-dodging insanity. But wait, there\'s more! Tapping the capture ball button when accompanied by an enemy will detonate it, providing a temporary nuclear cloud to absorb projectiles and damage any enemies hapless enough to fly into it. <P>Finally, and most satisfying, is the ability to transform the enemy into a huge column of energy to slay your opponents en masse. This introduces the all-important concept of counterattacks. When fighting bosses, all of which are equipped with similar beams, firing a blast into another will result in a tap fest for superiority, the winner of which will absorb the other\'s energy and cause his beam to swell to twice its former size. Once mastered, filling half the screen with pulsing blue energy is entirely feasible, obviously resulting in a massive, graphically satisfying dose of damage. <P>All G Darius\' bosses are grand in design, function, and size. Some span many screens, only letting you attack a portion of the beasts at a time. As with all Darius games, you choose your path through the game\'s 15 levels. In addition, each level has two subpaths. At the end of each subpath is a variation on the stage\'s boss, sporting a different color palette and a slightly altered array of attacks. As a result, you could say that G Darius has 30 unique bosses. With so many paths and bosses, nine difficulty levels, and a boss-only mode, G Darius offers more value than the typical shooter. <P>An old-school 2D shooter at heart, G Darius has been given a visual makeover in the vein of Square\'s Einhander. Each beautiful level is rendered in unique real-time 3D, each locale offering lots of background eye candy. A number of the game\'s projectiles opt for 2D sprites over 3D, resulting in a bizarre dimensional contrast. This doesn\'t hurt the game\'s visual appeal too much and is actually helpful, making the bullets easier to see and dodge. Musically, G Darius sports the tunes of famed Taito music team, Zuntata. Skillfully blending operatic choruses and power tools with a techno/new age flair, G Darius\' tunes are anywhere from soothing to nerve-wracking, but always appropriate and catchy. G Darius\' sound effects are just there and nothing more. <P>G Darius does have a few flaws, but most are overshadowed by the rest of the game. While the laser counterattacks were difficult to pull off in the Japanese arcade version, the PlayStation version sports a rapid-fire button that makes these a snap - a curse or a blessing, depending on how quickly you would like to beat the game. G Darius also features a Darius-trademarked variable frame rate - not exactly a feature; slowdown plagues parts of G Darius and is annoyingly absent in others. Finally, in a few areas, it can be difficult to tell obstacles from background art, usually resulting in an untimely death. Not that it makes them any less annoying when they happen, but these instances are rare. <P>It\'s good to see the shooter genre making a comeback. G Darius is a frenetic shooter with a surprising amount of depth, bound to please anyone who enjoyed Einhander and can get over the whole fish thing. THQ has once again outdone its former self and done stateside shooter fans a service by releasing G Darius completely intact, adding only its logo to the beginning of the game. --Peter Bartholow <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

In fact, with the amount of expectation placed on EA Sports to deliver, anything short of the Holy Grail of soccer games would have been considered a disappointment. As we all know, FIFA Soccer 64 is an OK game, but hardly what we all expected it to be. Now that J League Perfect Striker has been tweaked and is finally coming out in the US, guess what? It's actually better than FIFA Soccer 64. <P>Like every soccer game in the last year, International Superstar Soccer follows the model that FIFA set - fast 3D graphics, a choice of camera angles (two sets of three), and real stadium sounds. There are also thousands of motion-captured animations, an array of real soccer moves, and real-time play-by-play coverage. The graphics in this version look as good as anything else on the N64, and the sound, which was quite odd in the import version, finally makes sense (let's just say that, in both Japanese and English, the announcer is quite enthusiastic). The end result shows the polish that FIFA 64 seemed to lack. <P>International Superstar Soccer 64, like FIFA, benefits heavily from the use of Nintendo's analog stick; the play control is almost perfectly tuned and the fast pace of soccer is realistically captured. In addition, the game has multiple modes of gameplay (practice mode, season mode, exhibition game, etc.), 36 international teams, the ability to trade and create players, and a multiplayer mode that supports up to four players. <P>Overall, International Superstar Soccer 64 offers just about everything FIFA 64 did.

The first two volumes were spectacular; almost every game was worth owning. Volume 3 had about a 50 percent hit ratio. Volume 4 is just plain depressing. It contains five games, and most of them are little known games that were little known for a reason. <P>As always, the emulations on these arcade games are perfect. They have every feature and dip switch setting that the original game had, plus a crazy 3-D museum section that shows off some of the promotional materials for the game. The five games on the pack are pretty rare ones; I hadn't even heard of three of them before I saw this collection. <P>Pac-Land is the most recognizable title on the disc. It's a side-scrolling game that was loosely based (well, graphically speaking) on the Pac-Man cartoon. Pac's mission is to save a Fairy Princess and return her to Fairy Land. He does this by, well, running and jumping. The occasional power pellet allows him to eat ghosts, but it's usually just easier to avoid them. <P>Assault is the gem of the package. You are placed at the Battlezone-style controls of a tank, and are forced to traverse countless levels, blasting away at enemy forces in the process. The tank can also roll over onto its side, which makes avoiding unfriendly fire a breeze. <P>Ordyne is a shooter that plays like a mix of Parodius and Forgotten Worlds. There are shops along the way that allow for weapon upgrades, but these are limited in ammunition and don't last very long at all. The bosses in the game are pretty big, and all in all it's a decent game. <P>The Return of Ishtar is just plain weird. It uses Robotron-style controls to maneuver two separate characters around a dungeon. It's a sequel the Tower of Druaga and incredibly boring. <P>The Genji and the Heike Clans is a joke. Calling this an arcade classic is preposterous. You are cast in the role of a little samurai who runs around hacking stuff up. There is also a separate game mode where the characters are really huge, but they just look goofy. This one is a real loser, and it's probably the worst game on any of the Namco discs. <P>If you're a completist, you'll want to get Namco 4 for your collection, but it'll probably start collecting dust about two days after purchase. If you want a good arcade compilation, check out the first two volumes of the Namco Museum collection.

You will have an all-new ultimate weapon called SuperZapper which explodes freezes or bites enemies. Tempest X is based on a fairly simple concept. The player is a creature at one end of an two-dimensional shape and the player does not want the other creatures (enemies) on the other far end of the ""web"" to rise up to your end and kill you.

Enemies come up the channels and attempt to grab or shoot the player, who simply rotates around the outside of the tube, destroying anything that comes up the path. The game\'s sound is standard blips, bleeps, and explosions. The soundtrack is typical video game techno, right down to the sample of Chuck D screaming ""Bring that beat back!"" It fits the game well, and adds a little bit to the experience. Tempest X3 would benefit from a custom dial controller (more like the original arcade set up), because every home version to date - including this one - has suffered from poor control. Tempest was a fun game during its heyday, but slightly updating the graphics and adding a couple features doesn\'t make this game ready for the 90s. If you\'re jonesing for some old-school arcade action, check out something like Namco\'s Museum series instead - Tempest X3 just isn\'t worth the money.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

Xevious 3d/G+ - PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Xevious 3D is a furious interstellar shoot-fest teeming with rapid-fire 3D features. You get three bonus games nasty alien bosses a galaxy of polygon 3D graphics plus two-player simultaneous shooting action that'll have you x-claiming x-pletives."", 'Namco is giving PlayStation-owning nostalgia lovers more reason to celebrate. Not content with simply porting over last year\'s polygon-enhanced Xevious sequel, Xevious 3D/G, the creators of Pac-Man have gone the extra mile and included the entire Xevious arcade series on one PlayStation disc. Sadly, Xevious 3D/G, the game\'s showcase title, is plagued with so much slowdown it may scare away all but the most fanatical of shooter fans. <P>Xevious 3D/G+ contains four complete games on one CD: the original Xevious, also found on Namco Museum Vol. 2; Super Xevious - Xevious with a couple of new enemies and the word ""Super"" tacked on; Xevious Arrangement, a nice remix of the original; and of course, Xevious 3D/G. Additionally, after beating the game, some extra options open up, one of them being Xevious Arrangement\'s ""extra mode,"" which includes three incredibly difficult stages for masters to test their mettle. <P>There\'s not much to say about Xevious and Super Xevious. Both games are direct ports of the arcade originals, and are extremely similar to each other in terms of play. You\'ve got your main weapon, you\'ve got your bombs, and you try to build as high a score as possible while playing over a never-ending vertically-scrolling landscape - that\'s it. Xevious Arrangement on the other hand, while similar in play mechanics, offers a bit more in the way of structure. Two players can play simultaneously now (as opposed to alternating in the original two games), and the game is broken up into 16 areas, with four bosses and more variety throughout the stages. The graphics are enhanced (but not too much - think of what Nintendo did to update the Mario All-Stars collection), and there are two soundtracks to choose from (original and arranged). <P>And then there\'s Xevious 3D/G. The fact that Namco put all of the older Xevious titles on the disc is certainly admirable, but after playing 3D/G for a while, it becomes apparent that it was more of a necessity than anything else. 3D/G takes the classic Xevious gameplay and throws it into a fully polygonal 3D world. The execution is actually pretty decent - everything looks good and somehow holds true to the original\'s feel, although there are two new weapons and the ability to drop multiple bombs at a time. The game seems to be running almost completely in high-resolution mode, and the music is good to boot. So what\'s wrong? The game is far too easy, even on the hardest difficulty setting: Most novices will blow through all seven stages in a day, and the unlimited continues certainly don\'t help. Xevious 3D/G also suffers from slowdown, in fact I can\'t recall ever playing a game with slowdown this bad, even in the early days of the SNES. The slowdown is the worst in two-player simultaneous play where it becomes almost unbearable; some of the later stages seem to crawl by at a snail\'s pace, with dreadful slowdown from beginning to end. <P>All in all, Xevious 3D/G+ is an OK purchase for fans of old-school shooters. But if you\'re simply thirsting for a good 3D shooting experience, your money would be better spent elsewhere. --John Ricciardi <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

You\'re sent in as a one-man bomb squad with 20 minutes to diffuse two explosive devices. That taken care of, the plot not only thickens, but splinters off into four distinct lines, and which line you follow will determine how you play the game: You can aid the marines or work against them, and you can play as a human or follow a more peculiar route. You must piece the story together from fragments of speech overheard on your comm unit, and by talking to various scientists and military personnel inside the base - much of which is genuinely funny, thanks to Bruce Campbell\'s deadpan voice acting. <P>The clock is ticking throughout the game, sometimes onscreen, sometimes not. Just when you\'ve established a satellite link, reopening communication with the outside world, the marines who\'ve betrayed you are already two levels up and hot on your trail. This time function is touted by Konami as part of its ""4D engine,"" and as ridiculous as this half-baked PR invention may sound, the pace of Broken Helix makes for white-knuckle gameplay. <P>The game\'s control is a little sketchy. The standard Doom configuration, with rotation as well as strafing, feels a little loose here, so the learning curve is fairly high. In addition, the AI has a tendency to freak out at certain critical junctures. For example, if you are assigned to clear out levels of zombie-aliens in a small team of marines, and their mad dog sergeant will kill you if he\'s doing more than his share of the work, it is extremely frustrating that the entire team freezes if you so much as nudge one of your peers or block his path. <P>Further complicating control issues are the game\'s dim and sometimes vague graphics. The overall darkness of the game does much to augment its bleak pre-apocalyptic tone, but when pursued by the disembodied head of an alien, it\'s nice to see it before it bites your kneecaps off. <P>If you are a Bruce Campbell fan, Broken Helix is worth the ticket price for his tough-guy histrionics alone. Despite its graphical difficulties and control issues, the replay value of the game\'s four distinct storylines, and the challenge you\'ll find in unraveling them, make it worthwhile to any 3D shooting fans. --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Your favorite colored merchandising tools are represented in very high resolution on brilliantly detailed (if slightly busy) tables. Sampled speech (ay, yi, yi) adds to the general Power Rangers atmosphere, though it will do little for audio fans. The music is not much better, thanks to its odd mixture of Power Rangers themes and incredibly irritating metal tunes. <P>The accurate ball movement puts gameplay on the plus side of average, and the game is addictive enough to almost make up for the silly theme. (And now that the Power Rangers marketing tsunami seems to be ebbing, the game seems somewhat dated.) A variety of table layouts - hidden as well as conventional - and the usual mixture of flashing lights, loud noises, and ever-multiplying bonuses make this game surprisingly replayable. <P>Video game pinball has always been bit controversial when it comes to value - that is to say, how much money would you actually pump into a real pinball table? If it's more than 50 bucks, then this disc is for you. --Frank O'Connor <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Descent: Maximum,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['This is your last chance...your last chance to experience the nauseating feeling of total rotation speeding through the dark twisting mines of Descent...your last chance to encounter the unique sensation on the system.', ""If the current crop of Doom-clones doesn't give you motion sickness, you might want to check out Descent Maximum for the PlayStation. The premise is simple: You fly around futuristic space mines in a souped-up craft with an array of weapons at your disposal and plenty of enemy robots to blast. While navigating these obstacles in a true 3-D environment, you must accomplish each mission objective then find your way out before the mine blows in a decidedly Star Wars-like fashion. Sounds good, right? Well..."", 'This ""final"" Descent game features thirty action-themed levels, and while some of them are new, the majority are a rehash of Descent II on the PC. Navigating through each set of 3-D corridors can be somewhat confusing, especially since there is no ""up"" or ""down"" because of the game\'s free-roaming 360-degree movement. Once you\'ve got the hang of the game\'s play control, where you steer using the control pad and thrust in any direction with the PlayStation\'s four buttons, accomplishing each level\'s task is fairly simple.', ""The graphics in Descent Maximum look about as good as the PC version, although some of the objects here look a little low-res at times. The frame rate is smooth, as my slight nausea after extended play can attest, but the game never feels like it moves fast enough. The additional background textures and FMV cutscenes added to the PlayStation version make for interesting eye candy, but the end result isn't flashy enough to compete with the better PlayStation games on the market. The same can be said for the tinny psuedo-industrial soundtrack, which will have you reaching for your stereo after five minutes. The coolest feature of Descent Maximum is the two-player link mode, which allows two players to go head-to-head in specially designed levels. But the minuses outweigh the plusses, and the end result is a classic case of too little too late."", ""Descent Maximum suffers from the same problems that plagued Descent and Descent II on the PC. Sure, it's neat to fly around a futuristic mine in outer space, but how much compelling gameplay does it offer in the long run? If you're a fan of the computer game, or you love first-person 3-D adventures, you may want to check this title out. If this doesn't describe you, your money will be better spent elsewhere. --Glenn Rubenstein <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Madden NFL 97 PS1,,"['Complete, includes disc, case, cover art, manuals and inserts.']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['In 1996, EA positioned itself to take over the 32-bit sports video game market in the same way they dominated the 16-bit arena. However, Sony\'s premier football title, NFL GameDay, was so impressive that EA was faced with either shipping an inferior product or going back to the drawing board and waiting a year. They chose the latter, and the result is Madden NFL 97. Casting away the ""windows"" of previous Maddens, Madden NFL 97 makes use of passing options, like GameDay, that have each button correspond to a receiver (although Madden provides two more options by incorporating the top buttons). However, Madden\'s passing game is flawed in that it doesn\'t give you enough time to find an open man; and the upshot is that the playbook doesn\'t make it clear whether or not you\'re supposed to pass or run on a play. And forget play action - the receivers reach their target in seconds (which you might expect if everyone in the league had the speed of Deion Sanders). All but the most die-hard Madden fans will quickly realize that GameDay has better plays and control. To be fair, Madden 97\'s control is very responsive, but you\'ll have to dig deep into the instructions and have a decent knowledge of football to pick up play calling...and even then you\'ll probably be frustrated. The motion-captured graphics are very strong, but 3-D freaks may be disappointed by the use of rendered players. The intro graphics and gimmicks try their best to make up for the functional but plain gameplay graphics. On the sound side, Pat Summerall\'s commentary is sparse, and Madden\'s is downright repetitive, but their presence lends an air of authenticity to the game. James Brown completes the Fox TV team by introducing each game from the studio. In fact, the pre-game commentary is so specific that it\'s hard to believe that so much full-motion video could be crammed on the CD. For a first effort, EA\'s Madden NFL 97 is a fine offering. But despite its excellent features, graphics, and teams, players may wander back to NFL GameDay for a simple game of football.  <I>--Hugh Sterbakov </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Instinct will be your only ally. All-out combat your only choice."", ""Time has not stood still for Activision. Teaming up with Adeline Software, Time Commando's stunning 3-D graphics and innovative gameplay bring action and adventure on the Playstation to dizzying heights. And as promised, this is a game where the player's only armor is his instinct, and all-out warfare the only choice. Action on the Playstation is seldom more fun. <P>The storyline in this tilted side-view action adventure is straight out of cyberpunk fiction: A deadly virus has invaded the military's top secret super computer, and its catastrophic time-warping effects threaten to destroy the world. Obviously, the player's objective is to destroy the virus, but it isn't as easy as it sounds. The player must travel through time, collect as many uninfected memory circuits as possible, find a memory upload terminal, and send those healthy memory circuits back to the main computer to temporarily stall the virus. If successful, the player will terminate the virus before time runs out. And if unsuccessful.... <P>Time Commando's graphics are topnotch - the characters and backgrounds are beautifully rendered. The sound is remarkable for its realism - clobber a knight with an iron mace or beat a grizzly bear with a prehistoric club and hear for yourself. The game has nine magnificently rendered worlds, each with its own weapons (including prehistoric spikes, clubs, and rocks; or medieval iron maces, shields, and swords). Within these nine worlds players will confront 20 levels and over 80 enemies. These combinations add up to a complex and absorbing adventure. On the downside, the controls aren't perfect - they provide easy, though somewhat choppy, character movement. <P>Despite the minor movement flaw, players would be well advised to check out Time Commando - if only for its involved gameplay and myriad challenges. This is a well-executed action title with plenty of play value. --Matt Rubenstein <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Did Art Dink\'s Aquanaut\'s Holiday yield such a tremendous blow to the collective gaming unconscious that players would never look to the sea for fun again? Was it earlier still? Whatever the case, SingleTrac\'s Critical Depth may be the game that changes that perception, combining the gameplay and control elements of the company\'s earlier hits Warhawk, Twisted Metal, and Twisted Metal 2: World Tour. Only this time, you\'re underwater. <P>The game begins with the disappearance of undersea explorer Douglas McKragen, the discoverer of five mysterious and powerful alien pod-shaped objects. Twelve different factions enter the sea to find out more about these forces and set a course to uncover their mystery, each for its own reasons. The game features three modes of play: a mission/story mode, where you (or you and a friend cooperatively) can battle your way through eleven levels; a battle mode, where you capture pods in a selectable level; and deathmatch, where you can play against the computer or another human being in a split-screen mode. <P>Like the Twisted Metals, Critical Depth delivers a wild array of characters. The playable ships are divided into factions, one of which you must align with at the beginning of the game. Once you do, a mix of the eleven other ships will constantly stand in your way. The game\'s cast and vehicles include the nefarious Dr. A. Pocalypse captaining the Armageddon (which can trap subs with a grappling hook); the revolutionary organization the VLO with The Anarchy (which drops spiky metal balls); several men-in-black types from the CIA with The Manta (which fires a deadly electromagnetic ray); the Soviet Die-Hards and The Stalingrad (a slow but strong ramming ship); the Indiana Jones-like Professor Armstrong and The Archimedes (which is a rapid-firing Jules Verne-type sub); Greenpeace wanna-bes Team Earth Hope and the Mean Peace (which shoots a dolphin-shaped torpedo); ex-children\'s show host Captain Cutlass with the Sea Dog (yep, it blasts cannon balls); the evil Mordrid Corporation and the Bottom Liner (which steals weapons); Jack ""Lockjaw"" Keon and The Lockjaw (a shark-like sub with a bite); Deadhead Joe Skullion and the Death Sled (which shoots trippy-colored discs that stun); the mystical Order of Nishroch and the Ohm (which casts energy blasts); and The French Oceanographers and the La Griffe (which has crushing mechanical arms). Also, as in TM and TM2, the ships can pick up assorted weapons, such as the Piranha Swarm (quick, ripping robot fish), the self-explanatory Remote Control Torpedo, and the Magnetic Sucker (which sits in place and draws enemies in). <P>In a break from the Twisted Metal theme however, the stages aren\'t simply about annihilating all your opponents, though the option is there if you want to try. Instead, the goal is to retrieve all five pods, which are scattered throughout the level, and find the escape gateway. It\'s not as easy as it sounds, as each pod imparts its holder with an extra power. For example, the Power Pod doubles your power bar, the Damage Pod allows for double damage, the Pickup Pod doubles subsequent weapon pickups, the Armor Pod gives you more health, and the Shaker Pod lets you fire double shaker missiles - the most coveted of all weapons because they shake pods loose from opponents\' ships. <P>Those pods can make folks very popular, as SingleTrac has set the enemy AI in the game to go after ships depending on the number they\'re carrying. If you have no pods in your possession, you\'ll pretty much be left alone, while if you have all five, you\'d better be heading for the gateway because everyone\'s going to be coming after you, shakers primed and ready to go. This strategic element adds much to the Twisted Metal-style gameplay. Certainly, you can try to hide from the computer opponents and wait until they\'ve worn each other down a bit. But the downside of that is you could find yourself against a much stronger pod-enhanced enemy, or you might even lose the match to a ship that sneaked off through the gateway with all five pods in tow. <P>Also different from the Twisted Metal series are the game\'s combo system, shields, and bosses. Unlike TM2 (which initiated quick button-press attacks for the series), Critical Depth has four combos that use weapons not normally available for use: depth charges, surface mines, minefields, and stun charges. It\'s a minor point really, but it seems less cheap that you could keep on using an attack when you don\'t have the corresponding weapon in your weapon bay. Regenerating shields are also a new addition, bringing a lot to the gameplay. Holding on the triangle button will provide momentary respite from enemy attacks, and weapons like the Slow Poke missile (which triggers a ""Lock-On"" message for a ship but takes its own sweet time getting there) must, in turn, be used to wear down your opponents\' shields. The diversity of bosses is also nice, with a variety of challenges instead of the average mid- and end-boss battles. <P>On the downside, quite a bit of draw-in is noticeable in the game\'s graphics, especially in the larger levels like the Pacific Rim\'s underwater city and the coast of Venganza. The frame rate is also fairly slow; however, since it supports the illusion of underwater movement, it doesn\'t really detract from gameplay. But even with both these problems and the obvious lack of originality, it\'s still fun. <P>Does Critical Depth save the beleaguered underwater gaming genre single-handedly? Not quite, but it does a workman\'s job of it. It\'s a worthy successor to SingleTrac\'s Twisted Metal line and fans of the series should be very pleased. Sony has its job cut out for it when it attempts to do the next TM game without the developer, as is the current industry scuttlebutt. SingleTrac\'s left some decent-sized shoes on the pedal. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

You'll wreak helicopter havoc as you take on the hardcore criminal element terrorizing the gritty cities of the 21st century."", ""No, G Police doesn't mean that this game is full of cops with one pant leg rolled up, although they all do seem like they're on death row. This game is set in a domed city on one of Jupiter's moons, where several ruling corporations have let an underfunded and undermined police force maintain a modicum of order. <P>You are Jack Slater, a veteran war pilot who has joined the Government Police to investigate the death of his sister, who died under mysterious circumstances while serving on the force. You take up the controls of a gunship that is a meld of helicopter and V.T.O.L. (Vertical Take Off and Landing) aircraft and begin prowling the streets and low-ceilinged skies of the colony on a mission-by-mission basis. Tasks include scanning shipyards for illegal weapons, escorting and protecting ground team units, collecting and disposing of bombs, taking down enemy airships, and more, for a total of 35 assignments. As the game progresses, great-looking computer-generated FMV sequences debrief Slater on an escalating intercompany war, one that neatly ties into his own personal quest for vengeance. <P>The world of G Police is divvied up into numerous separate domes seen from a choice of configurable first- or third-person perspectives. These environments are loaded up as you travel through connecting passageways a la Resident Evil's door mechanic, although quite a bit quicker. The surroundings within these environments come into view slowly via an effect that is likely supposed to simulate searchlights, but that is more like watching a scene being built in front of you, such as in Aquanaut's Holiday and most PlayStation racing games. Of course, as an actioneer, G Police's explosions and gunfire compose a large part of its more impressive visuals, and they certainly are impressive, but don't really make up for the limited depth of vision. But control is definitely the most problematic point in the game. Though your ship can fly anywhere from ground level to the top of the dome, it's slow to turn around (which is hell in a fight) and never really moves as fast as you'd like, even when upgraded to a higher class later on. While these issues don't nearly make GP a bad game, they do prevent it from having speedy arcade-style play or, in effect, acting as a compelling action title. <P>It's true that G Police provides two full discs worth of gameplay, but the missions quickly seem like variations on a few basic themes, and the excitement never really builds, let alone climaxes. Fans of missions-based action games are probably better served looking up Sony's MechWarrior 2/Virtual On! hybrid, Armored Core, or Psygnosis' own space shooter, Colony Wars, both of which are much faster moving and a lot more fun. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

That's the predicament facing Eon, the hero of Granstream Saga, whom you must help discover a means to save his floating homeland and its neighboring continents from a deadly descent into the ocean far below. But good graphics and an intriguing premise aren't quite enough to make Granstream Saga succeed. This hack-and-slash action/role-playing game is pleasant, but it just doesn't live up to its ambition and ends up feeling small and empty. Granstream Saga looks fantastic at first: The fully polygonal environments are colorful and detailed, the frame rate is smooth, and brilliant special effects light up the screen. But further inspection reveals an inconsistency in the game's appearance. The slick frame rate bogs drastically at times and comes at the cost of texture mapping, as the characters you'll meet are all faceless and plain looking. Otherwise, the animation in the game runs from plain to bad, and the overhead perspective is very close to the player character, such that things can start to feel claustrophobic since you see so little onscreen at any given time. Yet altogether, Granstream Saga is one of the better-looking PlayStation RPGs in recent memory, especially when you consider its frequent use of high-quality full-motion anime cutscenes, which move the story along during key plot points. There isn't much sound to speak of in the game, and what little exists is appropriate but forgettable. You hear speech only during the cutscenes, and it's about as good as you can expect from English-dubbed anime. The soundtrack, meanwhile, consists of booming and resonant fantasy themes that correspond perfectly to whichever setting you may find yourself exploring. It's not the most memorable soundtrack you'll ever hear, but the music in Granstream Saga is perhaps its most impressive aesthetic achievement."", ""Assume the role of the young warrior Eon Granstream's only hope to prevent its continents from plunging into the sea.

Codename Tenka - PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""If Hexen is Doom with spells and Descent is Doom in a ship (as a great man once said), then Codename: Tenka is Doom with crouching. With so many first-person shooters released over the last two years, it's really hard to bring something new to the table. And while Codename: Tenka tries to stand out from the crowd, only its crouch feature (which lets you crawl through air ducts and other low-level passages) truly sets it apart from the pack. <P>Codename: Tenka takes place in a future when Trojan Inc. is up to no good. In the process of its genetic experiments it crosses Tenka, a guy who just isn't having it. Armed with a gun and his wits he sets out to get even. What follows are 20 missions of flying bullets as Tenka sets out to take down Trojan Inc. and its genetically engineered army. <P>The graphics in Tenka are the game's strong point - there is no pixelation of objects as they move into the foreground, and everything looks smooth. The grimy-looking levels (think Aliens meets Resident Evil) are all rendered in glorious 3-D. The animation in the game flows well as you move about, and the lighting effects give the game a dark mood, a mood further complemented by the haunting soundtrack and cut-scenes that give you an idea of what's going on in Tenka's head (think disgruntled postal worker with a bad headache). <P>The gameplay, on the other hand, is only a notch above average. Shooting enemies is annoyingly difficult (even with the weak laser sight) because of the up and down adjusting required to hit some of the hovering enemies - if you ever complained that the point-and-shoot aiming in Doom was too simple, you'll love this. Codename: Tenka does, however, present a challenge, and it's one of the harder first-person shooters ever released: The levels are elaborate, and sometimes finding the level boss or reactor is harder than destroying it. That aside, the play control is well designed, and in addition to the run and strafe commands, you can also jump and crouch. There is also a huge number of attachments, like lasers and missiles, to power up your gun, which morphs into newer, stronger weapons as you collect power-ups. <P>If you just can't get enough first-person shooter action, you may want to check out Codename: Tenka - it's one of the better ones out there. But if you've lost your love for the genre, you may want to skip it. --Glenn Rubenstein <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

NCAA GameBreaker,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation']",{},"[""NCAA Football GameBreaker is a heartbreaking near-miss. While the options are fantastic and the graphics are gorgeous, the playbook is a layperson's nightmare - and game control is extremely frustrating. College football fans just shouldn't have to come so close, yet still be so far.... <P>First, the good news: GameBreaker will be a treat for college football fans, whose games usually play second-fiddle to the bigger, badder NFL slamfests. GameBreaker runs on the new, improved GameDay engine, and has the options and small touches to bring out the school spirit in anyone. Then there's all those teams, displayed in fantastic motion-captured graphics. And let's not forget the abundant animation capped off with excellent pep band music and an echoing announcer's voice. In short, this game is simply gorgeous. It's easily the best-looking college football game anywhere. <P>Wait, sit back down. <P>GameBreaker is knocked out of the game thanks to its atrocious playbook interface. There's little doubt the designers meant well when they compiled the mother lode of all playbooks. But the options are so numerous (and so spread out) that it's far too difficult to find the right play for the right situation. Even the special teams section is hidden, meaning there's no choice but to cycle through the entire menu to find it. With seconds left and no time outs, the last thing anyone wants to do is peruse the playbook. Simple features could have made play selection so much easier: For example, on fourth down, the special teams box could (and should) have been front and center. And if that isn't enough.... <P>GameBreaker's got a tough one-player game - one so hard that even an experienced thumb-back can end up losing to the worst teams on the easiest level. This fact is largely attributable to the computer's ability to instantly find the perfect play and perfectly execute it (complete with precisely-timed stiff-arms). This may present a great challenge for the experienced, but players new to console football won't enjoy it at all...and with four difficulty settings to choose from, this is inexcusable. <P>This all adds up to put college football fans in a tough spot: There're plenty of frills, but no gameplay. College football freaks will enjoy this game despite the tough interface and gameplay. But first-timers (and NFL mavens used to the easy handling of GameDay, Quarterback Club, and even Madden) won't like what they find. Simply put, this game's not ready for the big leagues. --Hugh Sterbakov <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Herc's Adventures - PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Herc's Adventures for the PlayStation comes out at an awkward time. Virgin just released the Hercules Action Game, based on Disney's summer blockbuster, which has met with pretty good reviews. How does this similarly-themed title, based on the same subject matter, stack up? Pretty well, thanks to its unique approach and interjection of humor into the game - providing you're into bad puns and offbeat dialogue. <P>The setting is ancient Greece, and Hades, the lord of the underworld, has captured Persephone, the goddess of spring and new growth. On a mission from Zeus, you have a choice of three characters - Herc, Jason, or Atlanta - and you must rescue Persephone, or else ancient Greece is toast. The game unfolds over forty different landscapes in an RPG-lite style that plays a bit like the old Legend of Zelda titles. Herc's Adventures is mainly straightforward: You just hit things and throw stuff at your enemies. Each of the three playable characters has its own special abilities, and the game offers different options for overcoming obstacles. Along the way you are presented with a variety of mythological enemies and bosses to fight, and two players can even team up and play at once in a cooperative mode. <P>So how does it compare to that Disney game? Pretty favorably. With its subversive humor and pun-filled setting, the game is surprisingly funny (in a fashion similar to LucasArts' Sam and Max Hit The Road). The graphics look quite good, and in some ways have a more refined look than Virgin/Disney's version. All in all, it is very impressive for a 2D game. When it comes down to it, Herc's Adventures offers much more depth than the Virgin/Disney title, which is essentially an arcade game. The graphics, gameplay, and humor make a unique mix that results in a truly fresh title unlike most of the other games on the market today. --Glenn Rubenstein <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Project: Horned Owl - PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Project: Horned Owl is an unambitious offering - a game which neither breaks into new territory nor improves upon established standards. Ultimately, players will be severely disappointed when comparing it to the other light gun games currently available. <P>Horned Owl's problems begin with the first round (although shooting a civilian does provoke a semi-thrilling scream). The rendered robot enemies are very bland - they move and die in almost the same manner. Hit a car with a single shot and it's instantly destroyed (with hardly any animation to show it exploding). What's worse, the texture-mapped polygons are so pixelated that it's hard to believe the game is running on a 32-bit system. In fact, the shading on the walls gradates in giant blocks, and close-up explosions look like multicolored brick walls. The cutscenes are anime-style cartoons (the game was designed by famed manga artist Masamune Shirow), replete with bad dubbing and a corny plot. Simply, there aren't any neat touches that denote a well-developed video game. <P>If you live to shoot at your television, and you've exhausted all the alternatives, Project: Horned Owl will provide ample action. But ultimately you have to wonder why the effort wasn't put forth to make this a stronger title. --Hugh Sterbakov <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Machine Hunter - Playstation,,['Disc plus hard plastic protective replacement case only. Disc condition ranges from flawless to scratched but is guaranteed to work.'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Ready for a bloodbath? Then Machine Hunter is your rubber ducky a frenetic topdown shooter in which the player-character takes on an army of enemies under the command of a robotic hierarchy. In an unusual touch the player-character can actually take control of certain robots in order to put the smack down on other bad guys. Full-blooded action of the Loaded and Re-Loaded variety.', 'Three years ago, MGM Interactive was nothing more than a punch line in the world of video games. It\'s first ""game,"" Blown Away, was based on the Jeff Bridges/Tommy Lee Jones cinematic bomb and managed to do worse than the film. The high-profile ""interactive movie"" CD-ROM offered little in the way of gameplay. After that, MGM Interactive still existed, only it seemed like it was lying low, only releasing a title here and there. Machine Hunter for the PlayStation offers the most gameplay of any title MGM has published to date. Unfortunately, it still can\'t compete with the majority of games out there. <P>The premise of Machine Hunter is basic: It\'s the future, you\'re this guy, and you have a number of things to shoot at. Okay, so maybe the ""sci-fi"" storyline is a bit deeper than that, but it really doesn\'t figure prominently into the game, other than the fact that you get to inhabit a variety of machines throughout the game\'s levels. All this sets you up for an all-out gore fest as you put holes in a variety of organic and mechanical enemies in the game\'s assorted levels. <P>Machine Hunter plays almost exactly like the old PlayStation stinker Loaded, though it has a few improvements (mainly the graphics). The game uses the ""each button shoots in a different direction"" layout, and you spend the majority of your time getting used to it as you spin yourself around (you can face in any direction, but you can only really shoot in four directions, which vary depending on which way you\'re facing). It gets confusing, but once you\'re into the game, it\'s very easy to blast stuff - except for in two-player mode, which incorporates an annoying split screen. <P>Machine Hunter looks good for a shooter, but it just doesn\'t really compare to the bulk of the PlayStation games on the market. The prerendered movies are excellent, but once the gameplay starts, you get the feeling that this is old territory (even the light sourcing techniques seem dated). The soundtrack is fairly standard as well, not adding much excitement to the game. The ante has been upped in terms of presentation on the PlayStation, and this game just isn\'t that impressive. <P>Is the game any fun though? If you love overhead shooters, you may want to check out Machine Hunter - it provides a decent challenge that will occupy your time. But most die-hard fans will be a lot happier dusting off their copy of the original Loaded and re-experiencing one of the best PlayStation action games to date. --Glenn Rubenstein <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

However, Star Gladiator has a lot more in common with Street Fighter than you might expect, especially in terms of the many circular, Street Fighter-style moves. In fact, a couple of gameplay tweaks help to make this a lot more enjoyable than most 3-D fighters. Good examples include the easy and intuitive grappling and the (overly?) complex way in which blocking has been implemented. Speaking of blocking, it has clearly become a trend to add weird block-button-based special moves to fighting games, and Star Gladiator is no exception. Pressing ""block"" in conjunction with a strike button causes your Star Gladiator fighter to enact a ""super-block."" If this block is timed correctly, your character will pull off a spectacular, Fonz-cool, fatality-style super-move.', ""Away from the gameplay itself, the charismatic alien characters do their part to add to the atmosphere, and there's little doubt that Star Gladiator's animated 3-D backgrounds are the best going. All in all, the surreal alien characters, weapon-based fighting, and overall quality make Star Gladiator yet another peal of the thunder in the resounding Capcom storm. --Frank O'Connor <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Aerofighters Assault - Nintendo 64,,['aerofighter assault'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games', '</span></span></span>', 'aerofighter assault']",{},"['Cartridge and hard plastic collector case with reprint of original case artwork - NO MANUAL - Front label is fully in tact. Game cartridge is in good condition but may show normal signs of age such as minor scratches, discoloration, or debris in creases. All games are tested before being put into our inventory.', 'Paradigm Entertainment\'s second N64 offering, Aero Fighters Assault, is a mission-based air combat game codeveloped with Japan\'s Video System. The title, known as Sonic Wings in Japan, was constructed with the aid of an ex-F-14 fighter pilot onboard as a programmer. But even with the expertise and first-hand experience behind it, the designers seem to have left something out. While managing combat aircraft may be a breeze to a retired fighter pilot, to anyone else, handling a mechanically precise air vehicle will likely present a struggle just in keeping the ground in the right place. But that\'s just the beginning, as AF truly gives the saying ""fight or flight"" new meaning. <P>Collaborative play is key, as you and your team represent Project Blue, a UN-style military airforce that must keep the enemy contingent, Phutta Morgana, from world domination. In the beginning, you learn through a briefing that Tokyo has been flooded as the result of a thermonuclear bomb detonated in the South Pole (what about Australia and New Zealand?). Your first-level goal is to protect a hidden, subterranean factory from the enemy\'s onslaught. You\'ll also be informed, wasting no time, that the overall objective of the game is to bomb New York City to pieces. While this certainly poses a stunning project, you\'ll quickly realize this is the Phutta\'s objective, and your mission is to stop them. And you\'ll see quite a few locations from sea to shining sea before you get the chance, as the levels include sinking submarines in the Pacific Ocean, destroying a large mech-crab in a marinated Tokyo, gunning down the enemy in a desert canyon, and much more. <P>Characters Volk, Hien, Glenda, and Hawk pilot the various planes made available to you, for example, the F-14B Tomcat, A-10A Thunderbolt II, SU-35 Super Flanker, and the FS-X, each equipped with a combination of four distinct weapons. The planes and pilots you don\'t choose will be your crew for the level. Each fighter has guided missiles, rockets, 20 and 30mm gunfire, fireballs, fire arrows, air mines, as well as other, special signature weapons that fall under names like the Phoenix, Stars, Tomahawk, Makibishi, Hunai Shot, and the Ninja Beam. The Z-trigger is the main weapon of which you have an unlimited arsenal; the A-button is your subweapon - also unlimited; the B-button is your chaff (a defense mechanism that breaks opponents\' missile locks) or your air mines, with only 10 available; and the right shoulder button is your special, which unfortunately can only be used twice per round. Ammunition, however, does not mark the only variation in the aircraft. Each model has a distinct turning radius as well as speed and power capabilities - two features that you must master to adequately fend off the numerous enemy craft. <P>But real-life flight experience and unusual weapons aside, Aero Fighters, while being a full 3D, rip-roaring air combat game for the N64, has trouble standing up next to Ace Combat 2, Namco\'s same-genre title for the Sony PlayStation. Aero Fighters has nice graphics - until they\'re actually put to the test. As soon as lots of images appear on the screen, the frame rate slows down noticeably, resulting in choppy and inconsistent gameplay. In AC2, the frame rate is naturally a bit slower, but play is still fluid throughout. Aero Fighters\' short cinema sequences between levels are also somewhat rough and blurry compared to the clarity of the graphics in AC2. Aero Fighters\' sound is not exempt from criticism either. The music is not appalling but not really very good. And there\'s no good excuse for the endless loop of garish banter from pilots. Would top-notch pilots engaging in life-threatening battle actually have nothing else to say besides: ""Whoa, gnarly; this guy\'s toast; Borscht,"" and ""Bummer, that\'s bogus""? And while the chatter may be a soothing reminder that you\'re ""not alone out there,"" it very quickly becomes an aggravating nuisance and reason to hit the mute button. And while on the topic of sound, unless you\'re paying close attention or have a Rumble Pak plugged in, you may not notice that you are being shot at until about half your life is gone. The first few times your plane takes a hit result in a sound more like the impotent chirping of a moribund bird. Later on, lots of black smoke and flames shooting from your tail will clue you in that the end is near. <P>Nevertheless, the game does have some solid features. The special skills, for example, are challenging and presumably realistic enough to keep you busy for hours. Once you learn to master, or at least moderately use, the Padlock view (an alternative to the trail view or cockpit view in that you actually see your entire plane and its relative position to the other fighters as if you were watching from a third-party location), you\'ll find it adds depth to otherwise somewhat dull, repetitive missions. In fact, it\'s almost exciting to see your flight skills improve on the screen through this view; however, it will take some time to get used to. Those who aren\'t used to flight sims may find repose in the N64 analog stick controls or novice level that doesn\'t give a lot of freedom of movement, but lessens the pressure of flying like a pro and dealing with aero-disorientation from the start. <P>Aero Fighters also has special moves incorporated into the gameplay that are actual maneuvers performed regularly at air shows. The Cobra is a move in which you laterally drop altitude, maintaining your flight path as you decrease speed, making the plane trailing you zip past. Another is the Culbit, essentially a back flip in which you can, if done correctly, end up behind your predator. Neither move is easy to execute, so chalk up about 30 minutes of your learning curve right there. Aero Fighters races ahead of AC2 in two areas. One, your plane won\'t stall in Aero Fighters; the developers designed the fighters with a minimum speed and minimum turning radius. Also, AF can\'t be called easy. With the N64 control, you must learn to maneuver with precision, as it\'s not as forgiving as AC2. <P>In a word, realism may be the problem. Theoretically, it\'s great that you can barrel-roll, slip between 3D-rendered skyscrapers, dive-bomb submersibles, and perform death-defying acts you\'ve only seen at air shows, but where\'s the fun? This title is lots of work for not a lot of payoff. For a change of pace, you can elect to go directly after the big guys in the boss attack level, or you can dogfight your friends in the death match and at least fight someone as lousy as yourself. Though the latter suffers from the same ""Where the hell are you?"" quality found in the multiplayer mode of Starfox 64. Overall, the game is frustrating, slow, and boring enough that you might want to make sure you have a copy of your favorite game nearby just so, through your suspension of disbelief, you don\'t forget that games are actually supposed to be fun. --Lauren Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

NFL Gameday '97,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Avid video game sports fans might argue that a platform lives or dies by its football game. When Sega exclusively had John Madden Football (by EA Sports), the Genesis was the system for sports game fans. When a better version came out for the Super Nintendo, armchair quarterbacks took their dollars there. Last year Sony converted many Madden purists with NFL Gameday. And now there's Gameday 97 - a title that should be able to hold its audience while converting any remaining Madden holdouts."", ""Gameday 97 takes all the great options and features of the original and expands them with new options like season-length injuries, the NFL draft, more accurate statistics, and the ability to create players. More camera control is also included, allowing the player to place the camera at any angle. Every NFL team (resulting in over 1,500 players) and all stadiums are also available, which greatly adds to the game's immersive qualities. The end result is a souped up model of an already incredible game - a game that's sure to have players thinking they're controlling an actual broadcast game versus idly watching one."", ""The graphics of Gameday haven't been improved much, but its savvy use of motion capture technology heightens the realism, allowing players to react to hits more accurately. The game speed is also adjustable, allowing for up to 50 percent faster action than the original Gameday. The crowd sound effects have been joined by a play-by-play announcer, who is fairly accurate, although his responses sometimes come a little late."", 'The real focus of Gameday 97, however, is the gameplay. The control is dead on, making hurdling over a diving safety a distinct possibility. Making great one-handed catches, diving over the pile into the end zone, and even running out of bounds and slamming into a coach are all possibilities. The game itself also runs at a fast pace, with more time spent running plays than picking them (despite the fact that the 97 edition features twice as many plays as the original).', ""Overall, there are enough differences to justify purchasing Gameday 97, even if you already own the original. Even if you don't like some of the new features, there is enough solid gameplay to make this the best football game around, on any system. --Ryan MacDonald <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Blazing Dragons - PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Like many a Monty Python skit, Blazing Dragons absolutely should not work...but it somehow does. Cute and cartoony, while still retaining its Pythonesque wit, Blazing Dragons is set in a medieval(ish) kingdom populated by talking, mostly good-intentioned (if occasionally dim-witted) dragons. Blazing Dragons is a refreshing change of pace from the seemingly endless slew of high fantasy, point-and-select adventure titles. This game features a few arcade-style challenges (Dragon Thumb Wrestling and \'Cat\'-a-pult target practice come to mind), and even when a puzzle is less than ingenious the good-natured humor keeps the experience rollicking right along. <P>The game spins the tale of Flicker, an aspiring inventor-dragon, and his seemingly hopeless love for the fair Princess Flame. Princess Flame must soon marry, and her betrothed will be the dragon who prevails in the upcoming Knight\'s Tournament. Flicker, a lowly squire, knows that winning the tournament is his only shot at Flame\'s hand - er, claw - but cannot enter because he is not a knight. However, if he can become the right-hand dragon of one of the Knights of the Square Table, he will get his chance. Off he goes to seek the post - and thus begin the player\'s troubles: Each of the Knights, as it turns out, is a complete bumbler and has managed to get his royal tail in one sort of sling or another. Before the lowly squire can even become eligible for the tournament, he must first save each of the four bungling Knights from themselves. <P>The kingdom and its neighboring territories are populated with all manner of characters afflicted with Python-worthy weirdness: Rapunzel, harried by the countless requests of ""Throw down your hair!"" has gone at herself with a pair of shears and looks like someone from the colony in Alien 3; Dr. Sigmund Fraud has captured one of the hapless knights and is attempting to \'cure\' him of his delusions of dragonhood (although, per his contract, he must release his reluctant patient on December 25th - ""It\'s ze Sanity Clause!""); the Lady of the Lake has been reeled in and bagged by a trouble-making fisherman; the Cockney hostess of King Allfire\'s Castle Information Booth dispenses useless information to help with the game\'s puzzles; and Flicker himself must conquer his worst phobia...and discover the purpose of the almost useless and most annoying of his inventions, The Clicker. <P>A fairly straightforward fantasy adventure game, Blazing Dragons\' gameplay involves moving the animated sprite of Flicker from room to room, or territory to territory, utilizing Look, Speak, Walk, and Use commands. Like the best cartoons, Blazing Dragons is suitable for kids of all ages, but is really intended for audiences capable of catching the sometimes-subtle, sometimes-risque humor (most of which is delivered in the British lilt of Terry Jones\' superb voice-overs). Console video games have, over time, brought excitement, challenge, some genuine scares, and even something like intuition to the screen. Perhaps titles like Blazing Dragons will expand the possibilities of console games even further. Or, put another way: And now for something completely different. --Chris Hudak <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Echo Night,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""In 1913 the ship Orpheus mysteriously vanished, 45 soulswere lost...or were they? Echo Night thrusts you into the middle of a supernatural adventure to past times and distant places. As Echo Night's spellbinding story unfoldsyou'll visit past eras while meeting unusual characters and learning the secrets of the dead."", ""What would you do if you learned that your father was not just an average Joe, but instead he was a relentless sleuth hot on the trail of a demonic murderer? That's the premise of Echo Night, a first-person puzzle-solving adventure that puts you into the middle of a time-traveling quest to find out what has happened to your father. <P>Your life is turned upside down with the delivery of the mail. You receive a letter from your missing dad that contains a key to unlock a time-traveling adventure. With the aid of time-warping books and paintings, you learn that your father is chasing a sadistic murderer possessed by a demonic red knife. Your task is to aid your pop's quest while releasing the trapped souls of people murdered by the evil man's evil knife. To do this, you'll hop about to various locations at different points in time, all intertwined with your father's manhunt. You'll solve puzzles and appease souls with items you picked up along the way. Once you've completed the game, the nonlinear storyline will make sense, and you'll able to reconstruct the proper plot from the shuffled scenes you've seen.  <P>The main evil character in the game is extremely creepy looking - unfortunately, so is everybody else. All the characters you encounter suffer from a polygon deficiency - they all have pointy chins or blocky faces. What's even worse is that most of the characters also suffer from a lack of textures. Conveniently, most of the game's NPCs are spirits, which appear in the form of wireframes with light gray textures. This makes almost every ghost uninteresting and doesn't help motivate you to free the spirit. The backgrounds all retain the proper style for the time period you happen to be in and are delightfully mediocre. Not much can be said about the sound except that there's very little of it. You spend most of the game in musical silence until something disturbing happens. The sound effects are all very drab and unappealing.  <P>Still, the most frustrating aspect of this game is the game engine. Even with the speed turned up all the way your movements still seem too sluggish, and waiting for the cutscenes attached to every warping sequence becomes irritating rather quickly. Almost as annoying is the maddening use of time warping - it would appear that cabinets, paintings, dolls, and clocks are all capable of transporting you to different time periods. Although this is mainly a puzzle-solving mystery, your character can still take damage. It's not uncommon to run into a few different evil spirits. Unfortunately, there are no cool weapons for you to use; instead, you'll dispose of evil spirits with a light switch. Flipping on the lights isn't what I'd consider an adventure. <P>At Echo Night's heart there are some great puzzles. Unfortunately, they're few and far between, and most of the game revolves around sticking the object you had found two rooms earlier into something in the room you're currently in. The plot becomes too muddled,  and it's easy to mistake one bland spirit for another. The game is also extremely short - about six to eight hours for the average player, and the offer of multiple endings isn't really compelling enough for you to want to put up with the game's flaws all over again. The only thing this game does exceedingly well is give you an excellent example of how not to do a first-person puzzle-solving game. --Ben Stahl <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Shadowman,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"['Disc(s) only. Ships in generic case. Disc(s) are professoinally cleaned. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', 'Since their inception into the realm of gaming, Shadow Man\'s many incarnations have suffered from boatloads of gameplay-related and graphical issues that have kept the games from truly doing the designers\' expansive ideas justice. Though the Dreamcast version hits much closer to the mythical mark, several annoying issues remain, most undoubtedly due to a bad case of port-sickness. The Dreamcast\'s healthy innards made an easy task of handling the frame rates and resolutions, two of Shadow Man\'s previous incarnations\' uglier issues. The Dreamcast version runs at a brisk, fluid rate, and every element in the game is notably clearer and superbly defined. The game\'s environments use small, tight color palettes that do very much to carry the game\'s mood and tone. Even considering the rather small amount of color used in any given area, it\'s not at all difficult to distinguish elements and objects from the environments, due to a superb job of lighting and shadow placement. My only complaint, as far as graphics go, is the actual level of detail that went into each model; while by no means an eyesore, their poly counts are rather small considering the platform. This results in some very funny-looking (and not to mention out-of-tone) characters when viewed up close. The in-game movies are almost laughable, given the blocky nature of the models and the spastic, marionette-like animation. The problem isn\'t so apparent when communing with nonbipedal creatures (Jaunty, the undead dwarf/snake, most notably), as their forms and motions don\'t really have any real-world analogues. Shadow Man\'s soundtrack and effects, on the other hand, are artfully executed. The rich, synthesized soundtrack seems seamlessly interwoven with ambient moans and screams. As you approach enemies, they let out inhuman shrieks, then begin to eerily howl and cry as you disintegrate them. The only thing wrong, and the factor that prevents the title from earning a higher mark, is the fact that there is often a poor transition between audio tracks, which momentarily pauses the action while the new track begins. This is very annoying, especially during busy action sequences. Shadow Man\'s environments are the factors that most made me mourn the game\'s issues, as the environments are truly a joy to traverse and explore. In addition to the corporeal world, Mike LeRoi has to traverse Deadside as his otherworldly alter ego, Shadow Man (a la Soul Reaver), to halt the apocalypse. Deadside, the spirit world according to the game\'s mythos, is a stark and daunting place. The landscape is scorched and blighted, its denizens are soul-hungry and vicious, and its sheer size is aptly intimidating. Unlike most adventure games, most of the world is open to exploration from the get-go, with certain areas ""locked"" until Shadow Man is able to harness enough power to proceed. The world is insanely huge, and there are sights to see and secrets to be uncovered in nearly every corner. The nature of the game requires you to backtrack like mad, as many individual areas are only accessible after certain items are found or abilities and powers are gained. Traversing Deadside means much jumping, shimmying, swimming, and plain old ass-hauling. A myriad of standard adventure elements are worked into the levels\' designs, so you can expect to deal with the requisite amount of switch-hitting, level-pulling, and item-hounding to successfully proceed through your quest. To effectively deal with threats from this world and the next world, Mike LeRoi, aka Shadow Man, is armed to the teeth. Aside from a sizable real-world arsenal to stave off earthly threats such as alligators and hound dogs, you have a host of voodoo-powered weapons at your disposal, including ""asson,"" a flame-spewing wand, and ""baton,"" a soul-piercing rod. Mike/Shadow Man is also ambidextrous, meaning weapons and items can be mapped to both his right and left hands. While this feature is somewhat useful in terms of variety of assault, it\'s seldom possible to shoot both weapons at once, often leaving you with the feeling that the feature is largely useless. The game also has a lock-on feature that lets you target the nearest enemy and circle around it as you blast away. This is accomplished with the use of a single button, basically making it the preferred mode of combat. Overall, the controls aren\'t as responsive as you might like, given the game\'s platform elements - often, you\'ll find yourself stumbling onto a platform after a poorly timed and measured jump or vainly attempting to grab on to a ledge that you should be able to reach. But it must be noted that the responsiveness is much improved from the game\'s previous incarnations. Shadow Man for the Dreamcast is truly the only console version of the game that isn\'t a chore to play. While many of the elements are subpar in terms of what the platform can easily dish out, Shadow Man does have its merits. If you\'re one to enjoy a tangible atmosphere replete with intelligent references and somewhat disturbing themes, then this is something you should definitely check out. Granted, of course, that you\'re OK with ignoring some rather annoying issues.<i>--Miguel Lopez</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

One,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Many games attempt to make the player feel like the star of a big-budget action movie, but very few deliver on the promise. One delivers in a big way and truly feels very cinematic. The main theme throughout One is rage, and after playing through the difficult shooter, the theme really begins to dig in. The result is an action-packed game with nonstop destruction from beginning to end. <P>Enter the title screen, with the main character uttering these simple words: ""I made a mistake."" You awaken on the floor, with a gun in place of one of your arms, no memory, and police helicopters shooting missiles through your window. After smashing your way out of this predicament, you hop across rooftops and shimmy along ledges until you make your final escape. Then it\'s on to plot your revenge and ultimately find out your true identity. The game draws you into the feeling of paranoia and rage with its constant reminders that you are on the run.... Every once in a while you\'ll hear the crackling of police radios, which spout short phrases like ""we\'ve lost him"" and ""target reacquired,"" which sets the mood for this action-packed shoot fest.  <P>The lighting effects in One are really superb, with impressive explosions and awesome firepower - most notably the sight of the flamethrower roasting enemies. The music is very good, and it suits the game well. The sound effects are good also, with the voice-overs, gun, and explosion sounds fitting in just right. <P>The control in One is good (and it\'s even better with the dual analog controller), and although the jumping may be difficult at first, once you master the jumps on the second level, you should find that it\'s much easier to make the jumps in the later levels. Most enemies are best taken out with your rapid-fire machine gun arm, with its infinite ammo and increasing power (from killing and destroying, which increase your rage meter); it will dispose of most baddies fairly easily. If the scoundrels get too close, you can always whale on the O button, which results in a flurry of punches and kicks that will dispose of anything in close range. This is often useful if a group of enemies charges in at you. Most of the bosses in One can\'t be killed by direct shooting, an interesting change from most action games. Instead, they require you to shoot structures or drop things onto them to cause damage.  <P>Something that should be noted is the difficulty factor. While the second level is fairly difficult the first time through, the third level was actually easier, and the fourth level can be considered downright easy. However, the last two levels do offer a good challenge, and the end boss may take some time to figure out. Although the level difficulties are rather uneven, it\'s a nice change of pace to be able to plow through a level for once, and not worry about the tedious jumping.  <P>Fans of fast-action shooters should not pass up the chance to play One. Although there are only six levels, they are all very long and offer a good challenge. There are a few parts in the game that require careful jumping, so those who despise hopping around may be rubbed the wrong way. Overall, One is a terrific game from beginning to end. --Dave Toister <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

For those looking for raw street action, hit the pavement in a two-on-two game  boasting over 50 dunk styles and dazzling special effects--sparks during collisions,  fireballs, and smokin' players."", '<i>NBA Jam 2000</i> is all about realism and detail. Xavier ""The X-Man"" McDaniel\'s  moves are motion-captured into the game, offering smooth animations of a staggering  800 moves, including defensive grabs, push-offs, post-ups, and picks. Each of the  hundreds of players is rendered with realistic facial features and signature moves. Throw  in over 200 categories of stats, detailed team management options--including the ability  to draft, trade, sign, and release players--and improved replay options with multiple  camera angles, and you\'ve got yourself <i>the</i> basketball simulation for any season.  <i>--Eric Twelker</i>', ""NBA Jam 2000, like last year's game, tries to incorporate two styles of basketball in one cart. The first type, and the type that the name NBA Jam is best known for, is a two-on-two arcade-style game that basically rips off the old NBA Jam formula that Midway created back in 1993, and the other is a traditional five-on-five basketball game. Both modes are fairly competent and are different enough to make both games at least mildly interesting. While this makes for an attractive package, the game tries to be too many things at once, and ultimately each and every feature falls a little flat. The list of options contained in NBA Jam 2000 is an impressive one. The most notable options are, of course, the arcade and simulation modes. The arcade mode is set up like the original NBA Jam, with big dunks, pushing, and on-fire streaks. The game has 50 dunks in all, and it is, well, jam-packed with cheat codes. The simulation side has all of the usual features and game modes, like season mode, exhibition games, play-calling, stat tracking, and roster management. Additionally, the game has all the trimmings that come with the NBA license, including all 29 NBA teams, authentic arena floors, and somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 NBA superstars. You can also make custom players and teams, tailoring each individual player's style, as well as a team's overall style. As an added bonus, the game also includes a three-point contest mode and free-throw-practice option. If you're familiar with NBA Jam 99, then most of the options and features mentioned above aren't all that new to you. The same can also be said for NBA Jam 2000's overall feel and control. The control is fairly responsive - the players move, shoot, and pass the ball when you want them to. The inclusion of both icon and directional passing is nice, since it lets you use what you prefer when it suits the situation. The AI of the computer is fairly aggressive, and the AI players steal the ball more often than in other basketball games. This gives the game a nice challenging feel right off the bat, though the game does have holes in the AI that, once discovered, make beating the machine a real breeze. You can often run the ball right into the paint for an easy two, since the computer takes its sweet time when resetting its defense.  Visually, NBA Jam 2000 looks decent, although it isn't on par with other N64 basketball games. The players don't look convincingly realistic, and the motion-captured animation is hampered by poor transitions. The players occasionally go from dribbling down the court to a full jump shot without showing any of the animation between dribbling and being in the air. The play-by-play from Utah Jazz announcer Dan Roberts is repetitive and dry, and Marv Albert's comments as studio host don't help much, either.  In the end, the decision whether to pick up NBA Jam 2000 lies with one simple question: Do you want an arcade-style basketball game or a traditional basketball game? If the answer is both, then give NBA Jam 2000 a rental, because while the game does a decent job of representing both styles of play, it isn't the best choice for either style. Dedicated games like NBA Showtime (for arcade-style gameplay) and NBA Live 2000 (for a more realistic game) do a much better job of representing their respective schools of video-game basketball.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

It set the player in a small spaceship and commanded him to destroy all aliens, which basically meant that it was a Space Invaders clone. Not that there is anything wrong with that, of course, but it doesn\'t exactly have what it takes in the ""long-term playability"" department. However, it paved the way for Galaga. Galaga is quite simply one of the best examples of how a game can be so simple yet so amazingly addictive it\'s almost scary. The objective is still the same - shoot everything that moves - but the extras spice up the proceedings so much. For example, every now and again, an alien will come down to the bottom half of the screen and start firing a tractor beam. Move into its path, and your spaceship gets captured. Here\'s the cool bit - if you manage to rescue your stolen ship by shooting the alien that is carrying it, the old ship gets bolted onto your new one, creating a bigger spaceship with twice the firepower!

Rising Sun - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['At the close of 1941, the Japanese empire unveiled its imperialist plans to unite the western Pacific under the flag of the Rising Sun. The name for the new territory would be the ""Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"". Beginning with the unprovoked, devastating raid on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese military launched surprise attacks against key strategic targets in an all-out effort to secure victory. From Singapore, to Manila, to the tiny island of Guam, the nations of the western Pacific faced the most dangerous enemy ever--men who considered it an honor to die in service of the Empire of Rising Sun! <P> Now you, too, can take your stand at Okinawa with TalonSoft\'s <I>Rising Sun</I>. Storm the shores of the islands of the South and western Pacific or hunt your foes down through the snake-infested jungles of Burma. Do battle on the sandy beaches of Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Betio, and many others.', ""Back in 1998, TalonSoft lined up a host of wargaming heavy hitters like Bob McNamara, Charlie Kibler, John Tiller, and even James F. Dunnigan himself to headline what was to be a blockbuster new game called East Front. Unfortunately, the game released with a completely inadequate manual and a host of bugs that rendered it almost unplayable. But TalonSoft was undaunted by the game's poor reception, and quickly made much additional documentation available for download from its web site, just as it soon issued the first of several patches. This kind of product support and improvement has helped restore a good reputation for TalonSoft and its wargames. TalonSoft's Rising Sun shows that the company has continued to refine its wargames even more, and the result is very impressive. <P>Rising Sun is the third piece of the TalonSoft tactical wargaming trilogy called the Campaign Series. After the release of East Front, the game engine underwent a significant overhaul for the subsequent West Front, and it's the West Front engine that has been improved on for Rising Sun. Because Pacific Theater combat differs so much from that in Europe, there are a lot of additional rules in the game. For instance, since it was common for Pacific Theater combat to occur at night, there are extensive night rules. Rules for caves let players re-create the bitter fighting on islands like Iwo Jima and Okinawa, while banzai attacks are a fearsome weapon unique to the Japanese arsenal. Pacific Theater terrain, such as dry and flooded rice paddies, jungle, and even kunai (elephant grass), is also well represented in Rising Sun. <P>The game mechanics will be instantly familiar to anyone who has played serious wargames in the past. Rising Sun is a platoon-level game that plays out over a hex grid. Movement and combat are carried out simultaneously, as players alternate turns. Each unit has 100 action points, which can be spent moving, firing, or a combination of the two. The number of action points required to perform a certain action depends on the type of unit involved, the terrain, and sometimes even the weather. Scenarios can combine a wide range of units, as armor, infantry, mortars, artillery, and air support all play a part in the battle. The game's database accurately models the performance of just about every weapons system in use in the Pacific from 1941-45, so if an engagement took place there in that time, it's probably possible to re-create it within the game. <P>Though there's a lot of detail involved in the game mechanics, the user interface is actually very manageable. A combination of simple mouse clicks and keyboard shortcuts is enough to perform almost any game function. The map can be viewed from both 2D and 3D perspectives, and the latter can be helpful when you're trying to determine line of sight. Unfortunately, the game doesn't let you view a prospective computer-calculated path before moving a unit more than one hex. A closer 2D view, with combat values displayed directly on the units, would have been helpful as well, but for the most part the game does an excellent job of both displaying information and letting you manipulate units. <P>Traditionally, wargame artificial intelligence has always had the burden of having to handle very complex situations, and thus has tended to come up short against capable human players. Given wargamers' lowered expectations, the Rising Sun AI isn't necessarily excellent, but it does manage to hold its own in most cases, and seems to understand how best it should handle Allied troops (which typically have high firepower) compared with the Japanese troops (which are better suited to close assaults). In fact, if the AI has a specific weakness, it's the computer's reluctance to break from its patterns; the AI ought to actually assault with the Allies when the situation demands it (such as in beach landings), rather than just sit and exchange shots in unfavorable circumstances. Playing against the computer tends to be more challenging if you stick to the suggested side in the solo scenarios. -- <i>Bruce Geryk</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Battle Arena Toshinden 3 reunites the toughest deadliest characters from two Toshinden games and adds more new fighters--32 in all. With more playable characters than ever before and a ton of brand-new features Battle Arena Toshinden 3 is truly a fighting game to be reckoned with!', 'Back in 1995, Battle Arena Toshinden was a shining example of 32-bit gaming and helped launch the PlayStation. It was a good game, but it suffered from repetitive and eventually tiresome gameplay. When Toshinden 2 came along, everyone was expecting an amazing sequel. Unfortunately what they received was a rehash with slightly better graphics and the same boring gameplay. Toshinden 3 is what Toshinden 2 should have been - an improved version of the original, with a ton of new characters and improved play mechanics.', ""The gameplay and combo systems are the most obvious beneficiaries of the overhaul. For starters, fights only last one round, and there is no time limit. Each player's life bar has been extended though, so battles last roughly the same amount of time as most fighting games, although here most of that time is spent fighting. Aside from each player's special moves, players can also call upon a super-move (an overdrive or soul bomb) that will rock their opponent with multi-hit combinations (which look cool despite their simple execution)."", ""The graphics have also been touched-up nicely. Each player looks good and moves well, and the arena backgrounds are also impressive. In this version, fights take place in the same type of arenas as the previous games, but they're completely enclosed, allowing you to slam enemies into walls as well as blasting them into the ceiling. Toshinden 3 also offers a choice of graphics mode. The game's default mode is 30 frames per second, which looks great but moves a bit sluggishly. Gameplay fiends will want to sacrifice a bit of the graphical shine (and the associated texture mapping) for speed and control by switching over to 60 frames per second."", 'Toshinden 3 continues the trend started by Tekken 2 with characters that unlock as you progress through the game. While only fourteen characters can be selected when the game starts, players can unlock hidden characters and bosses by finishing the game with different characters (until all 32 characters are available). All the characters from the previous Toshinden games are included, except for a conspicuously missing Fo Fai. Replacing Fo is Bayhou, a crazy monkey with the same fighting style. In another parallel to Tekken 2, Battle Arena Toshinden 3 also allows players to try out new combos and see how much damage they do in a practice mode.', 'Toshinden 3 provides all of the upgrades that the series needed to get back on its feet. It adds plenty of intriguing new features, without losing the better aspects of the previous games. If you were one of the many who thought Toshinden was neat, but far too dull, this game may have what it takes to turn your viewpoint around. --Jeff Gerstmann <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Furthermore, the Jokers lets Gotham&apos;s most feared criminals compete with one another in order to distract Batman. Naturally, Batman has to take care of the other master criminals, too, while trying to free Robin. The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin is 2D platformer/ beat&apos;em up. The goal in each stage and level is to walk from left to right to reach the (sub)boss and the end of the stage.

Whether you fly solo or with a friend the intense sound action and arcade-perfect Hyper-3D visuals will blow you away!"", 'Ask any experienced gamer what genre has been neglected the most over the past three or four years, and you\'re almost guaranteed to get a unanimous response: shooters. For some unknown reason, most game companies have decided that if it isn\'t a first-person, in-your-face Doom clone or the latest rip-off of Virtua Fighter or Tekken, it isn\'t worth producing. Fortunately, this isn\'t the case in Japan, where games like RayStorm, Taito\'s incredibly intense new space shooter for the PlayStation, are still being released frequently. Those thirsting for an amazing old school shooting experience can relax - your game has arrived. <P>RayStorm is the sequel to RayForce, Taito\'s 1995 arcade game that made it to the Saturn early last year as Galactic Attack (Layer Section in Japan). Unlike RayForce, which was a 100 percent 2-D vertically scrolling shooter, RayStorm consists of completely polygonal characters and backgrounds. This provides a much more lifelike feel to the action. Despite its 3-D environment, however, RayStorm is still, at its heart, a traditional 2-D-style shooter. The PlayStation version of RayStorm also includes an added bonus - in addition to the complete original arcade version of the game, a special ""Extra Edition"" comes on the CD, offering enhanced visual effects, more enemies, an arranged soundtrack, and more. <P>As in the original, your ship has two main methods of attack: the main blaster (which, depending the ship you choose, lets out either a stream of constant laser fire or multiple rapid-fire blasts), and lock-on homing lasers that seek out and destroy enemies stationed away from your ship. Since many enemies attack from below your ship\'s line of sight, the only way to destroy them is to take them out from above with your homing lasers. This type of strategic planning isn\'t found very often in shooters because developers tend to value visual splendor over actual gameplay.. Fortunately for RayStorm, that\'s not the case here. <P>Graphically, RayStorm really delivers. Intense lighting effects and marvelous explosions fill the screen. As with most polygon-heavy games, there\'s a bit of slowdown when things heat up, but it never gets out of hand. As for the music, the game\'s two soundtracks are done well. Even so, some tracks lack the urgency and intensity you\'d expect from a fast-paced shooter. Taito fans should easily recognize the music though, since it\'s once again done by the now-famous label (in Japan, anyway), Zuntata. <P>Overall, there\'s not much to complain about in RayStorm. But the game does contain a couple of things fans of the original may not like. First of all, even with variable difficulty settings, the game is nowhere near as difficult as its predecessor. Additionally, the main weapon doesn\'t seem to be as much of a necessity as it was in the original. Moreover, it doesn\'t change much visually when fully powered-up (a minor complaint, but it\'s still a little disappointing). <P>All in all however, RayStorm is easily the best shooter currently available on the PlayStation (we\'re reserving judgment on Xevious 3D until we see the home version). No shooting-game fan should be without it. We know that several companies are interested in porting the game, so it\'s safe to say that if you can\'t afford to import, the US version shouldn\'t be too far behind. --John Ricciardi <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Or, at the very least, a number approaching the volume of PS gun peripherals currently on the market. <P>Elemental Gearbolt is, if anything, unique.

The water or lightning elemental can provide quick shots for destroying fire from the sub-bosses and boss, while a companion, if present, bombards them straightaway with the fire elemental setting. <P>Once a level is finished, you are presented with the ""trade-off"" system, which lets you decide if you want to take your bonuses in the form of experience points, score points, or percentages of both. Bonuses come from the number of enemies destroyed, coins collected, and from how many consecutive hits you have accomplished. Though your motivation for getting a high score seems to be solely braggadocio, advancing levels through experience points will increase maximum health, just like in an RPG. <P>Namco\'s incredibly accurate GunCon is optional in Elemental Gearbolt, but it\'s not necessarily needed, as the enemies are quite large, and shooting in their general direction seems to cap them fairly easily. Unlike in Time Crisis, foes don\'t shoot at you from far away, although you can shoot at them the second you see them, with the rail bringing them quite close, quickly. <P>Besides the obvious threat of huge menacing sub-bosses, the real challenges seem to come from freeing all the encased fairies and pulling off a high number of consecutive shots. Sometimes when you emerge from around a corner, one or two visible fairies might be in your line of sight, but you\'ll only have one or two seconds to shoot them before you\'ve carried on, staying with the pace of the game. And even though being square on your target isn\'t absolutely necessary to make a successful hit, the occasional bobbing views will sometimes frustratingly throw you off completely. <P>In bringing Elemental Gearbolt over from Japan for US audiences, Working Designs has performed a number of improvements on the game. Where it was once fairly easy, it\'s now pretty tough. You\'re no longer able to play through the game in its easiest mode, and even the normal setting sees you fighting for you life and searching the screen for health-restoring elixirs. They\'ve also added 12 hidden chalices throughout the game, which correspond to the different elemental weapons, increasing the power of the one it works in accord with. <P>In its original state, the Japanese EG was a likable break from the norm, though overall a little too quick to beat. Working Designs\' revisions have made it a much more challenging gun game - one that\'s now much easier to recommend. It\'s not quite at the level of Namco\'s Time Crisis or Point Blank, but it\'s far and away a lot more fun than Midway\'s Maximum Force and Area 51. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

And under the fantastic visuals lies the solid programming muscle from Square - the Japanese firm responsible for the Final Fantasy series. So do these factors mean that Tobal No. 1 is a role-playing game? Yes and no. <P>Tobal No. 1 is actually a combination of RPG and fighter that uses the Playstation's polygon shifting strength to good effect. This game doesn't feature too much in the way of complex texture mapping, but it has plenty of sharp, smooth polygons. Running at between 30 and 60 frames per second, (depending on the screen content), this is one of the smoothest video games around, looking just as sharp as Mario 64 in some ways. <P>As a straightforward beat-'em-up, Tobal No. 1 is more than adequate, differing enough from Virtua Fighter and Tekken to retain some individuality. The controls may not be quite as responsive as these fighting games', but Tobal No. 1 nonetheless holds its own. Characters with great variety, both in appearance and fighting style, lend plenty of depth to the beat-'em-up portion of the game. <P>Tobal No. 1 strays from the rest of the fighting game pack with Quest mode, a psuedo-RPG mode complete with dungeons and various traps. Though a nice twist, the game unfortunately looses steam in its role-playing mode. This mode is shown from a behind-the-back view, switching to the standard side view when the player encounters an enemy. Items along the way replenish health, add strength and defense, and level up the character, raising the maximum amount of hit points. The controls work great when fighting, but applying the same functions to an RPG just doesn't work. Walking is mind-numbingly slow, but running is impossible to control. Also, there isn't much variety in the different dungeons, which are sure to keep players running around in circles. <P>Although Tobal No. 1 is simplistic, the combination of action and role-playing is at times absorbing and intense. For those who can handle the sluggish control, this game makes for a good value. --Frank O'Connor <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Box,package,', ""Dragon Ball is a popular Japanese anime series currently making headway in the US. The series' content makes for a perfect fighting game: lots of flying guys, all of whom have the ability to shoot fireballs. Several Dragon Ball fighting games are already on the Super Famicom, Mega Drive, and PlayStation, none of which have seen the light of day here. Dragon Ball Final Bout is out in Japan, and it's likely that it will be the first DB game to be released stateside. While Dragon Ball Final Bout is probably among the best DB games around, that still doesn't make it a good game - and it is not a good game."", ""The graphics in DBFB are a mixed bag. The characters themselves look decent and remain faithful to the animated series' artwork, but the backgrounds are absolutely horrible. In some cases, the playing field is nothing more than a flat, green plane with nothing in the distance. The characters animate decently, although the entire game moves at a fairly slow pace. The only saving grace of the game's appearance are the great looking projectile attacks, which, unlike Street Fighter's contained blasts, are huge beam-like blasts that stretch all the way across the screen. Also, when the other player counters with a huge blast of his own, the two projectiles collide, and the camera spins around as the beams battle for dominance. The characters aren't very diverse, due in part to the series' rather convoluted timeline, and results in Final Bout containing four different incarnations of some characters, each from a different part of the series. So while you can choose between 17 characters (see the codes section for info on how to get more than the original eight characters), most of them are nearly identical."", ""The gameplay in this title is truly atrocious. There is a real lack of variety in the game's moves, with each character having a punch, kick, block, fireball, a few special fireballs, and some normal specials, like dragon punches and the like. The game comes to a complete stop whenever a special energy blast is used and gives the opponent a chance to counter the attack with an energy blast of his own, but the system is totally flawed. During the first player's warm-up motions, the word counter flashes on the screen for a split second. When it appears, the opponent has a chance to hit different buttons. Depending on what he hits, the opponent can block the blast, absorb the blast, or counter with a blast of his own, resulting in the impressive projectile battle mentioned above. The characters in the world of Dragon Ball can fly at will, but when you stop flying, the character simply takes his standing position in midair. This, well, just looks silly."", ""Dragon Ball Final Bout is a poor excuse for a fighting game. It relies too heavily on the license, tossing interesting gameplay right out the window.

While the options are fantastic and the graphics are gorgeous, the playbook is a layperson's nightmare - and game control is extremely frustrating. College football fans just shouldn't have to come so close, yet still be so far.... First, the good news: GameBreaker will be a treat for college football fans, whose games usually play second-fiddle to the bigger, badder NFL slamfests. GameBreaker runs on the new, improved GameDay engine, and has the options and small touches to bring out the school spirit in anyone. Then there's all those teams, displayed in fantastic motion-captured graphics. And let's not forget the abundant animation capped off with excellent pep band music and an echoing announcer's voice. In short, this game is simply gorgeous. It's easily the best-looking college football game anywhere. Wait, sit back down. GameBreaker is knocked out of the game thanks to its atrocious playbook interface. There's little doubt the designers meant well when they compiled the mother lode of all playbooks. But the options are so numerous (and so spread out) that it's far too difficult to find the right play for the right situation. Even the special teams section is hidden, meaning there's no choice but to cycle through the entire menu to find it. With seconds left and no time outs, the last thing anyone wants to do is peruse the playbook. Simple features could have made play selection so much easier: For example, on fourth down, the special teams box could (and should) have been front and center. And if that isn't enough.... GameBreaker's got a tough one-player game - one so hard that even an experienced thumb-back can end up losing to the worst teams on the easiest level. This fact is largely attributable to the computer's ability to instantly find the perfect play and perfectly execute it (complete with precisely-timed stiff-arms). This may present a great challenge for the experienced, but players new to console football won't enjoy it at all...and with four difficulty settings to choose from, this is inexcusable. This all adds up to put college football fans in a tough spot: There're plenty of frills, but no gameplay. College football freaks will enjoy this game despite the tough interface and gameplay. But first-timers (and NFL mavens used to the easy handling of GameDay, Quarterback Club, and even Madden) won't like what they find. Simply put, this game's not ready for the big leagues.  <I>--Hugh Sterbakov </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Red Asphault - PlayStation,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The futuristic racing game in which the vehicles double as weapons of doom. Rivals will seek to win by destroying you so you must do the same. The race circuit that spans 5 worlds and 24 tracks culminating in the ultimate showdown in the Arena of Death.', 'Interplay\'s Red Asphalt is one of the most interesting racing games to come along in a while. Rather than just using speed to win races, you have at your disposal front and rear guns to take out the competition as you overtake them. In addition, the game features a (very slight) RPG element, as you are awarded experience points for winning races. Along with WipeOut XL, Twisted Metal, and Destruction Derby, Red Asphalt proves that racing games can be more than just driving in circles. <P>Sure, the game is packed with all kinds of plasma guns, oil slicks, and even napalm, but the emphasis here is still on racing. Killing off your enemies is simply a means to get ahead. They don\'t really die anyway, they\'re just forced to lose five seconds of race time or so, waiting for a replacement car to drop on the track. If you win races, you gain experience points (to raise your driver\'s driving, targeting accuracy, and damage stats), cash (usable to buy armor, more powerful weapons, nitros, or whole new cars), and ""chaos"" points, which are required to advance to new worlds. <P>This is one of the more innovative looking racers since WipeOut XL. Gorgeous use of color - especially noticeable when you move on to a new world - and solidly detailed texture mapping never seem to impede the game\'s frame rate. The cars are a lot more solid looking than in, say, Twisted Metal 2, although the comparison may not be entirely fair since that game is entirely 3D (in play as well as looks). <P>The level design of each world\'s tracks is what really sets Red Asphalt apart from other racers. Sure, each of the six tracks in the first world (Los Angeles) is noticeably similar, each being essentially an extended version of the previous track. But you won\'t care when you get to Varkon, the second world, which for all intents and purposes is hell, with lava falls, glowing skulls, and amazing jumps. The game really gets hectic here, with some jumps that are impossible to make without a nitro boost. Miss one, and plunge to your (temporary) death. Even if you pull off the speed required, some of the jumps have extremely narrow stretches of track to land on, making it easy to miss your target and end up vulcanized in lava. And check out the tropical amusement park stylings of the twilight third world, Tranzine. Again, this game just looks great. <P>Red Asphalt has arcade-style driving controls, which are a snap - at least to drive. The vehicles are extremely responsive, and you\'ll have no difficulty taking turns at high speeds. The four primary buttons control offensive weapons, defensive weapons (they shoot out the back), nitro boosts, and acceleration. It\'s a little difficult to master them in the default configuration, since you\'re nearly always holding down three of the four. Certain weapons are disappointingly ineffectual also. It\'s a shame to save up through six races to buy an expensive new car whose missile system would be powerful, if it didn\'t have such a weak targeting system, which when coupled with very slow regeneration makes it almost useless. <P>The only real shortcoming with Red Asphalt is that the combat element could be a little more precise, or ultimately more important. Weapon targeting is often more a question of your character\'s targeting attribute than actual player control. This is especially true of the defensive weapons, which just fire off randomly from behind your vehicle, without even the pretense of player control. And since being ""killed"" by the opposition essentially entails just a few seconds of watching your opponents pass you up, rather than any substantial loss, it\'s entirely possible to win the game ignoring the combat angle entirely and just focus on driving. <P>Still, Red Asphalt is a solid contribution to the ""drive \'n\' kill"" genre. The variety of weaponry and level design prove that the future of driving games is in all the extra stuff that makes racing more exciting than the real thing, without displacing the primary goal of just driving like hell. --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Tiger Woods '99 PGA Tour,,"['Platform: Sony PlayStation', 'E - Everyone', 'Golf, Sports']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""The player who revolutionized the sport of golf is now featured in his very own PlayStation game TIGER WOODS '99. The game has been designed from the ground up, resulting in a fun and easily accessible experience. Finding the green is a breeze with an innovative club design that makes the golf swing seem simple. An entire 18-hole course can be enjoyed in only 30 minutes, and if you prefer not to play as Tiger Woods, there are seven other licensed PGA tour pros to choose from. You can select from nine varying modes of play including Practice, Tournament, Skins, Fourball, and Shootout mode. Compete on five different, lushly rendered, real-life golf courses (including Las Colinas). Listen to helpful and often humorous comments from Tiger himself, and groove to the driving beat of quality techno music as you play. Whether you're a big time golf fan or a complete novice, there's much to savor here."", 'EA Sports has really done a good job of transcending typical sports-games presentation. With each and every passing game, it feels more and more like a televised sporting event. The same rule applies with Tiger Woods 99, EA\'s newest golf-game franchise. Yes, along with the vigor and exuberance the young Tiger has brought to the game of golf, so too has EA livened up the often drab trappings of virtual golf. But is it good enough to make a difference? <P>As with most golf games, the usual array of options and modes are included: number of holes played, Mulligans, weather effects, the Skins Game, shoot-out, tournament, and tour play, etc. In Tiger Woods 99 you can also use or play against seven other professional golfers, including Lee Jacobsen and Tom Kite. For armchair golfers who need to get up to speed, there\'s also a practice mode. Let\'s put it this way, practically every option you could want or need is included. Five courses are also available for the plundering, ranging from Summerlin to Scottsdale. <P>Graphically, Tiger Woods is like any other golf game. Digitized sprites thwack away at little white balls on polygonal courses. While not exactly the smoothest golf engine out there, Tiger Woods imparts a clean, functional look that is easy on the eyes and efficient enough to get the job done. Tiger, as well as the other golfers, is animated fairly well, although they all look a little like cardboard cutouts, and as usual, the trees and other background objects are flat sprites as well. <P>Gameplay falls into the familiar routine of pressing a button to activate the time-honored ""swing arc"" and pressing the button again upon its return to hit the ball. Fortunately, the whole interface is very clean (unlike Fox Sports Golf) and, as a result, is very user friendly. Tiger Woods 99 is as easy to play as Hot Shots Golf or Nintendo\'s Waialae Country Club. Definitely a very good thing. What\'s also convenient for newbies is the automatic club selection. If you don\'t know a five iron from a high five, well, you needn\'t worry. This is one of the few golf games you can just pick up and play. If you\'ve got some golfing buddies who are video-game novices, this would be a great game to pick up. Keeping your score under par isn\'t an impossibility here.  <P>The sound is where it all drops down as far as overall experience. Crowd noises sound flat and canned, and even though golf is a quiet game, if you turn the music off, this game is almost completely silent. Which is how you\'ll end up playing this game if you value your sanity. It seems as if EA decided to amplify its Tiger Woods license with some ""rockin\'"" tunes, a move that doesn\'t really work here, whether you\'re young or old. The best advice would be to turn off the music. It sounds like the stuff you\'d hear in a monster-truck game, not a golf game. <P>Although arriving on the scene later than some other golf games, Tiger Woods 99 is still as good a golf sim as you\'re likely to find. Although a little more arcade-y than some might like, for the majority of gamers out there, this\'ll do just fine. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

While other puzzlers have been happy to stick to the tried and true Tetris clone formula, this one has an original world, perspective, and premise. You guide a beach ball through a number of Escher-esque worlds that float vertically several miles above the ground."", ""The goal of the game is to collect a key or number of keys needed to open each level's exit and cut out before the ever-present hourglass timer runs out of sand. Each structure is made up of platforms your ball can cling to on all sides if approached from an end corner. In the beginning, navigating these areas requires you to jump from platform to platform (down and up are defined by you by the way, not by any ground-based constant), avoid spikes, and other simple tasks, while later on, heated squares, icy patches, and rolling columns are introduced to further vex you."", ""As it might sound, the game begins rather slowly, but that's only because it takes the initiation of about one level to properly introduce each new gameplay element. About 20 levels in, things start getting nice and tricky. The main payoff of Rollaway hits right around then. It provides some excellent puzzles - real brain-stumpers that will make you feel like a complete fool once you finally grasp their shape, solution, and well-thought-out design."", ""What Rollaway lacks over other puzzle games is a strong two-player mode. Sure, it has a Simon Says type challenge and a time trial, but neither is much fun. On the bright side, they'll both make you want to go back and hog the single-player mode. On the other hand, if two players can't compete well, the mode should've just been left out."", ""That aside, Rollaway is a great game that offers just about all the addiction, frustration, and satisfaction a puzzle fan could ask for. It's originality and strong level design makes it a welcome departure from the norm. --Joe Fielder <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

In this version Sonic Blastman must save the Earth from diverse kinds of evil forces, from street gangs and terrorists, to aliens and robots and finally, an evil clone of himself. The fight starts on a construction site in Earth and ends up in outer space.\n\nThe game is only for one player. As in any beat 'em up, the game consists of defeating the enemies on screen before continuing in the stage. Sonic Blastman can punch, jump, and grab his enemies, too. He also uses a special attack that knocks any enemy nearby, but it dizzies him temporally. Another particular feature is the way Sonic Blastman holds his enemies: When he approaches his enemies, he is able to grab them in order to shake them and throw them back from him, or unleash a series of punches. However, if he punches them repeatedly, he will eventually hold them, so that he can blast them with a sonic wave, hit them with a whirlwind punch or throw them backwards. All of these throwing effects depend on the direction the d-pad is being pressed when pressing the punch button. His most powerful attack is his D. Punch, which must be charged with a certain button, which can be discharged. The D. Punch is also a limited attack.\n\nThe bonus levels are an adaptation of the arcade version. The major difference is that since there is no punch pad, the player must charge strength by repeatedly rotating the d-pad.\n\nLike with most beat 'em-ups of the era, the Japanese version had female enemies which were replaced by male ones in the American and European versions, mostly because of Nintendo of America's strict censorship issues at the time. Only the first two stages of the game feature human enemies.""]","by

Special and combination moves all depicted in detailed fluid animation make this a stern test of gamers' reflexes and strategizing. Among its innovations are special moves that restore your fighter's vitality during the battle."", ""If there's one thing the PlayStation has a lot of, it's fighting games. Good fighting games on the other hand are a different story. Tecmo just happens to have one of those different stories though, and it goes by the name of Dead or Alive. <P>Dead or Alive was originally released as an arcade game that ran on Sega's Model 2 board (read Virtua Fighter 2) some time ago. A perfect arcade port later appeared on the Saturn in Japan and was considered one of the better fighting games on the system. The title has of course recently resurfaced on the PlayStation with a fresh new look, with new character models that look significantly better than the Saturn and arcade versions. <P>The game features nine playable characters from the get-go with two more attainable via total completion of the game. Every time you beat the game you are rewarded with a new outfit for one of the characters. There is a total of 84 costumes in all, which range from your typical karate gi to scuba gear. The design of the characters themselves isn't groundbreaking by any means, in fact some look suspiciously similar to characters from the Street Fighter, Tekken, and Virtua Fighter series.  <P>Dead or Alive's fighting engine is obviously influenced by Sega's Virtua Fighter series, with its punch, kick, and hold button setup. The hold button is just that, a button that allows you to get your opponent in grappling holds. This is really kind of cool because you can counter holds and attacks and then reverse counters on top of that, so you sometimes can get an awesome Jackie Chan-style grappling match that goes back and forth three or four times till someone messes up and pays the consequences. It may sound complicated, but since the special moves are all fairly simple to perform, anyone can easily learn how to play.  <P>Graphically, Dead or Alive is one of the nicest-looking PlayStation games to date. The character models are nearly seamless, meaning that the 3D characters don't appear to be blocky or made up of polygons. Instead, the characters have a very smooth, almost skinlike quality to them. Mixed with the fast and fluid motion of the character animations, this gives a stunning sense of realism. Apparently the designers went a little too far when it came to the motion design of the female characters though, because they made it so their breasts bounce while fighting. Honestly, if it weren't for the fact that they keep on bouncing well after they should, it may have been seen as a commendable effort for the designers' keen attention to detail. At any rate, the breast-bouncing can be turned off or on in the option menu. The sound effects and accompanying background music, while not up for any awards, get the job done.  <P>Overall, Dead or Alive delivers a realistic fighting experience. Combining fantastic graphics and above-average gameplay, Dead or Alive is a fun and challenging fighting game well worth picking up. Hopefully, it won't be overshadowed too much by the US release of Namco's Tekken 3. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The GB version is, in actuality, a rather surprising 2D side-scrolling action title, very reminiscent of the 8-bitters of yore. You play as Turok, champion dinosaur hunter, and you trek through five deadly worlds packed to the brim with bipedal lizards, man-eating plants, and lethal death traps, among other hazards. There is quite a nice mix, as far as the makeup of the levels go: In some, you\'re given the freedom to roam back and forth and all along the fore and background, slicing up or shooting enemies, leaping over obstacles, and grabbing power-ups. Others levels take more advantage of the game\'s semi-top-down perspective, as they scroll along, forcing you to move at their pace; if you\'re unfortunate enough to be caught behind a wall or similar element, you\'ll suffer a rather crushing demise. Regardless of the levels\' design, their primary objectives remain constant: Eliminate everything that moves, and survive. Enemies are gingerly scattered throughout each level, and some will straight-up bum-rush you, while others will attempt to snipe you from afar. Luckily, you have access to a miniaturized version of Turok\'s legendary arsenal, including his slick bow, trusty firearms, and (arguably the game\'s most versatile weapon) his mean bowie knife. Most weapons can be upgraded, and there are special ""mix kits"" scattered throughout the game that let you morph different arms together to produce some truly sick hybrids. Graphically, Turok: Rage Wars looks great. Turok himself is fluidly animated and nicely detailed, considering the hardware. The levels look suitably lush and alive, though it seems as though Acclaim neglected to infuse some of the enemy characters with sufficient life; they often look lame and stiff, in comparison with the game\'s other elements. Overall, though, the game has a nice, vibrant feel to it, which is very pleasantly surprising. If you\'re looking for a high-quality action game, you can\'t go wrong with this one. The slick visual feel coupled with the tried-and-true gameplay make for a great game to help the in-flight hours melt away.<i>--Miguel Lopez</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Strange worlds colorful graphics and unique game play set this game apart from other 2D scrolling titles. You can play as the sultry Nikky or the completely bizzare Fargus. Each character has different skills that will help you get through the many levels of Pandemonium 2.', ""When Crystal Dynamics released the original Pandemonium in '96, it had the misfortune of introducing a 3D-on-rails game at a time when titles such as Tomb Raider and Mario 64 were jump-starting the full 3D-platform bandwagon. It was the big fad of the time, if for no other reason than because full 3D seemed like the logical progression for the side-scrolling genre, and it's undoubtedly created some great games. But Pandemonium survived, at least heartily enough to earn a sufficient following to merit Crystal's creation of the sequel, Pandemonium 2. <P>The main characters, Nikki, Fargus, and Sid have gone through a few changes since the first game. Nikki, the once adolescent tomboy, is now a twenty-something sorceress styled to be the ultra-vixen incarnate, but her image falls slightly short of a more ambulatory Peg Bundy (of Married With Children fame). Fargus, the sophomoric, unpredictable jester has taken on a more pyromaniacal bent, while Sid, the fast-talking soul of an ancient warrior on a stick, has remained roughly the same. Sid comes into play more as a device than a character, as Fargus launches him at enemies or sends him to retrieve items that are just out of reach. Nikki and Fargus are on a quest to obtain the power of the Comet of Infinite Possibilities, a celestial body that flies over the land of Lyr every 300 years, for their warped, selfish purposes. Their antagonist is the evil, if well-intentioned, Goon Queen who seeks the Comet's magic for her own twisted agenda. <P>You dash through 19 levels in all, each with a different mission. In the Huevos Libertadi level, you'll free baby eggs from wire cages. In other levels, you'll simply try to reach the end of the course, avoiding obstacles, collecting treasure (500 baubles) that eventually provides an extra life, grabbing gold keys to gain access to bonus levels, new stages, and power-ups, and complete various tasks along the way. The P2 bosses include a fire-breathing dragon, the Evil Witch, The Egg, Stan the Man, Mr. Schnebelen, and the final, and most difficult, Buddha. These battles test the skills you have used throughout the game, adding new ones, such as the ball toss with Mr. Schnebelen. You are encased in a wooden container that is attached to the back of a tank. As it drives forward with you attached, you must avoid the balls Mr. Schnebelen throws as he runs behind you. As if in a tennis match, you volley the balls back toward him, attempting to strike him down before he destroys your vehicle. <P>Even though the game has the basic style and many of the same objectives as the original title, it's more than a redux with better graphics. Characters such as bipedal blue fish, watchdogs, Goons, the helpful, yet hazardous levitating bats, dragonflies, worms, praying mantis, and even mech-robots are present throughout P2 within the various levels. Some, such as the worms and fish, are fairly innocuous, and a simple jump on the head, a lightning strike, or a fireball will wipe them out. Naturally, the mech-robots pose a bit more of a problem. Likewise, you are equipped in these levels (Hate Tank and Collide-O-Scope) with mech-armor as well. In the aforementioned Hate Tank, Nikki or Fargus drives through a series of stages running over runts throwing grenades, shooting a minihelicopter, and avoiding or destroying gun turrets until the level is complete. In Collide-O-Scope, the mech-character battles gravity, falling through a vortex while avoiding exploding. Also in this stage, land combat with like-sized and -minded robots tests your ability to adjust from Nikki or Fargus' nimble movements to more clunky, weighty maneuvers. <P>Besides the additional characters, a multitude of old and new, interesting and often challenging obstacles are introduced, such as spinning fans, electrical fields, falling snowballs, fire geysers, spiky land mines, lava pits, and so on. But P2 consequently arms you with better power-ups, such as directional fireball projectiles, Fargus' ability to combust (igniting everything around him), and Nikki's deadly lightning jabs. And perhaps the best weapon against most of the impediments Nikki and Fargus encounter is their ability to climb ropes and chains, scale with their arms, and hoist themselves up onto edges and platforms. <P>Pandemonium (both versions) is known for plenty of jumps that you must time perfectly to execute successfully. In P2, the frustration level drops significantly due to the added climbing and catching feature, as most mushrooms and sky-high trampolines are just out of reach. <P>On the negative side, the combination 2D and 3D graphics are much smoother in this round, as you can at least differentiate between backgrounds and playable foregrounds; however, chaos is still king - occasionally to a fault. The blind jumps and uncertain paths are frustrating, to say the least. And while P2's levels are, for the most part, disparate, many maintain some original devices, such as running around the inside or outside of cylindrical rooms ending up exactly where you started off, unless you're adventurous from the get-go. This is an instantly confusing, but terribly effective trick, but as negatives go, it could be worse, and the learning curve for these levels is relatively short. <P>Overall, the graphics are better and more colorful, and the camera angles have become even more vomit-inducing than the original in that the backgrounds and foregrounds are still insane, but at least you can differentiate between the two, and the gameplay is satisfying, challenging, and surprisingly not monotonous. Put simply, it's a fun and mostly unpredictable platform game, in spite of not being fully 3D. --Lauren Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

It\'s really easy to use, too. All you have to do is load in a picture of you, a loved one, arch nemesis, etc., and have fun with all of the many FUNctions. Your image comes out the other side, made better by you. This is great for working out your mind muscles or just to get the kids off your back for a while. SuperGoo has two main places you can work. One section is called the Goo Room and in it you can digitally liquify an image. Don\'t worry about making a mistake. It can easily be remedied with one of the many ways to UNDO an action. There are pretty interesting tools to be found here: twirl, ripple, noise; each of which can be used to totally funkify an image. Face Palette is another section in which you can make your friends or other people go incog-Neato! Add many different facial features or even switch genders on an unsuspecting ""loved"" one.

Descent 3 Expansion: Mercenary - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['History dictates that not much should be expected from mission packs for action games. Mercenary, the official expansion for Descent 3, barely exceeds such low expectations. While it offers more of what made Descent 3 great, its few good points are overshadowed by its generally bland level design and a lack of new features. Both Mercenary\'s box and the official Interplay Mercenary site state that the game contains seven new single-player levels, four new ""B-side"" multiplayer levels, and a ""variety of the best single and multiplayer fan-made levels."" It\'s a rather unpromising start to the proceedings that the game\'s producer hasn\'t actually figured out exactly what\'s packaged with the game. As a service to the busy people at Interplay and anyone interested in purchasing Mercenary, it should be pointed out that there are no single-player fan-made levels on the disc, at least none that are actually installed or listed on the new game menu. Which leaves, at least as far as single-player action is concerned, the seven Outrage-designed levels. Only two of the levels, the third and fourth, manage to match the quality of the best Descent 3 levels. The designers seem to have abandoned the outdoor rendering capabilities of the Fusion engine. A few missions have brief forays onto the surface, but for the most part you are once again trapped in the endless tunnels of the first two games. None of the levels even comes close to the visual impact of Descent 3\'s cityscapes. The third mission is by far the best and almost makes up for the rest of Mercenary\'s relatively mediocre levels. Its lengthy task-list includes several exciting boss monster battles, some tricky shooting puzzles, and a timed, frenzied, and tense escape from the exploding complex. The fourth level is almost as good as the third and will have you forgetting about the blandness of the first two. However, that memory will come rushing back during missions five through seven. They\'re long but completely and noticeably forgettable. The final boss is also a letdown. Its lair is a simplistic boxlike structure, and fighting it offers no unexpected events, nor does it require any ingenuity on your part. Around ten new enemy robots have been added to the game. While the box states that they exhibit a new level of artificial intelligence, it\'s not readily apparent through simply playing Mercenary. Since the box is wrong about the single-player fan-made levels, it\'s hard to tell whether the artificial intelligence is actually improved or not. Also not included: any new weapons or multiplayer game modes. A new flyable ship is actually included, the Black Pyro, and while it handles a little differently from the other ships, it\'s not enough to get excited about. The one eye-catching graphical embellishment to the Descent 3 engine is the addition of a motion-blur effect on some of the enemies. Politely discounting the fan-made multiplayer levels, only four professionally made multiplayer levels are provided. Though that\'s not very many, each is unique and actually fun. One is a castle reminiscent of Unreal\'s level design, another is a series of connected volcanic islands, the third is a pinball machine, and the last is a detailed re-creation of Outrage\'s offices. The levels are all gorgeous and clever, though not necessarily conducive to multiplayer action, especially the office. Had the developers displayed so much inventiveness in the single-player component of the mission pack, they might have made a mission pack whose quality approached the recent Half-Life: Opposing Force. As it is, Mercenary is a somewhat threadbare mission pack that doesn\'t even live up to the expectations set by its own packaging. Hard-core Descent 3 fanatics might want to pick up Mercenary just to experience levels three and four and for the level-design inspiration provided by the ""B-side"" maps. Everyone else should just wait for Descent 4. <I>--Erik Wolpaw </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Normally we wouldn\'t put both words in the same sentence. But before you run out and buy this CD for your young Teletubbies fan, be aware that it has some limitations. The game starts with the four Teletubbies, all lined up in a row. You use the right hand controls to move a Teletubby around the screen. It doesn\'t really matter which one you choose, as each lets you discover the same things. Once you\'ve grabbed your Teletubby, you move him or her around Teletubbyland, where you discover 11 activities. Nearly all of these are simple causal games, letting toddlers press any key to make something happen on the screen. For example, in the Hiding game, you steer your Teletubby to another Teletubby that is hiding nearby. Once all are found, they give each other a group hug. The main problem with the program is that kids get lost in the Teletubbies\' world. There is no connection between the icons and the activities that they launch, and once inside an activity, it is impossible to exit. Children play for two minutes, and then are automatically ejected back into the Teletubbies\' world. This is too bad, because nearly all of the games are responsive and fun. The good news is that because it is easy to control the Teletubbies, kids stay glued to the program.

Crusaders of Might and Magic - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Drake--a loner toughened by exposure, hardship, and a life of fighting the scourge that destroyed his family as a boy--is swept up into the midst of a new crusade. He must join the High Guard as they try to rid the lands of the Legion of the Fallen. With swords and sorcery, Drake must fight his way through five distinct realms. From the spires of the Citadel to the murky depths of Duskwood, Drake runs, jumps, ducks, fights, and casts spells as he becomes ever more powerful. He must eventually challenge the leader of the dead army himself.', 'It\'s probably a good thing that New World Computing\'s Crusaders of Might and Magic is so short. In its 10 to 12 hours of gameplay, you get a glimpse of its basically good intention: to enrich the third-person action genre with some role-playing game conventions such as evolving character stats, spell casting, and questing. However, if the game were any longer, you\'d start getting really tired of its numerous shortcomings and even more frustrated that its good ingredients are only half-baked. <P>While it\'s set in the interesting Might and Magic fantasy world, Crusaders can\'t actually bring itself to tell much of a story. The hero Drake is supposed to have witnessed the death of his family and town at the hands of the evil lord Necros and his Legion of the Fallen. But as is too often the case in such games, you\'re left to read about these preambles in the accompanying manual rather than actually seeing (or maybe even feeling) their impact in the game itself. The Drake you do get to play delivers an occasional wisecrack but develops very little as a character. <P>The game starts as Drake feels himself drawn to a flying city and its leader Celestia, who signs him up as a crusader and sends him off on a series of several predictable miniquests through equally familiar environments. Drake traverses a dark forest, an elven mine, an ice world, and eventually a stone stronghold as he rescues royalty and recovers lost artifacts, all of which leads up to his final, predictable meeting with Necros himself. Although the designers have filled some of the areas with the usual RPG cast of townspeople, unfortunately they have little to say and little bearing on the game itself. <P>The gameplay engine is more promising than the story. While it isn\'t especially detailed or complex, Crusaders does accomplish what many other third-person games don\'t, and that\'s to achieve a smooth sense of movement. Drake has an engaging, fluid stride. That\'s a good thing, because the paths to and through the five major environments are extraordinarily, inexplicably long. You will spend tedious stretches of game time just sprinting between areas. Speed potions and level-ups quicken the pace a bit, but still leave you with plenty of time to wonder what the designers were thinking when constructing the game\'s endless paths. <P>When you finally get into combat, the engine performs well enough. Like Lara Croft, Drake climbs, jumps, and does evasive flips, though not as gracefully as Lara does. Until Drake acquires a bow later in the game, his arsenal includes axes, swords, and various bludgeons, all of which he wields adroitly. Running overhead swings, lateral slices, and even crouching lunges are possible with the right key combination. Drake\'s menagerie of enemies, mainly undead skeletons, ogres, and diverse yeti, are not especially smart, but some of them use their shields very effectively, as should you if you hope to survive. The combat does start piling on noticeably midway through the game, which usually forces the hero to fall back and devise a spell-casting strategy. <P>At its best, the combat engine allows for some fun swashbuckling as you spear your way up and down stairwells or dispose of a line of foes with leaping overhead chops, but the magic system actually gives the game some tactical depth. Ten spells, such as healing, fireballs, freezing, and lightning, all have three levels of power. Both the visual and actual effects of the spells are quite good. For instance, a spectral ally spell casts a protective shield that holds off enemies while you fall back and fire away. Snap freeze and glacial prison spells encase foes in nicely detailed ice blocks while you chop away. Of course, mana fuels these powers, and it recharges itself during Drake\'s long-distance runs. The only problem with the magic system is its cumbersome interface, which, as with Drake\'s weapons, requires you to cycle through a growing arsenal before settling on the right one. Doing so can be frustrating or even deadly in the heat of battle. There also seemed to be some bugs in the combat system, which caused the game to crash occasionally. <P>Brevity and the basic competence of the combat engine keep Crusaders on the borderline of fun. Role-playing game fans, especially followers of the Might and Magic series, will throw up their hands in dismay at Crusaders\' failure to make much of anything out of the plot and character. Finding half a dozen objects and people and then going to fight the boss is all that passes for a story arc in the game. There are no surprises, no substantial character growth or interaction, and no nuance to any of the quests. Occasional bits of dialogue even satirize the role-playing game format a bit. ""It\'s always something,"" Drake quips when he discovers that rescuing a dwarf prince isn\'t enough to satisfy one early quest. You\'ll wish the designers had employed some of that self-awareness in other parts of the game. The loneliness of the long-distance runner sets in as Drake must perform marathons just to reach the few goods shops and trade in what he scavenges from fallen foes. Character attributes like speed, intelligence, and spell resistance are in the game, but it\'s unclear whether specific actions boost them as you proceed or all stats just increase predictably whenever Drake levels up. <P>In addition, the graphics engine is only decent. The blurry textures and exposed seams wouldn\'t be so bad if some attempt had been made to lend the environments a little atmosphere. Instead they look like blocky B-movie sets. And aside from the spell casting, nothing interesting ever happens visually. <P>Essentially, you\'ll spend much of your time in Crusaders of Magic and Magic just watching Drake wiggle down boring paths as you contemplate all the ways in which the game should have been better. A smidgen of plot and character development, a pinch of real puzzles or surprising encounters - anything of the sort could have spiced the mix to a more tolerable blend. But Crusaders seems to fall into a growing category of game, which is basically inoffensive and even competent at times but offers no compelling reason to keep playing. Crusaders fails to execute its good premise in such obvious ways that it\'ll leave you frustrated and wondering at exactly what point a fine idea becomes mired in blandness. -- <i>Steve Smith</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Bust-A-Move-4,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Fans of the Bust-A-Move puzzle series can look forward to more sleepless months with Natsume\'s release of Bust-A-Move 4 exclusively for the PlayStation. Once more, the rotund dragons from Taito\'s Bubble Bobble series find themselves having to restore the color in their monochrome world and return for another round of manic bubble-bursting mayhem.  The general premise of Bust-A-Move has remained the same since the game\'s inception on the Neo Geo back in 1993. In single-player mode, you shoot colored bubbles up into clusters of other bubbles. When a bubble makes contact with two or more bubbles of the same color, they pop. The object of each stage is to pop all bubbles before the timer reaches zero. There is a total of 640 single-player levels, which includes both the arcade and puzzle mode stages. In two-player mode, the game stacks up against the best Puzzle Fighter battles out there with both players clamoring to send patterned attacks across the screen. Since the biggest draw of the Bust-A-Move series has always been the multiplayer aspect, it\'s good to know that Taito has kept this portion essentially unchanged from previous installments. The dueling matches still capture the frenetic pace set by previous Bust-A-Moves. As a sequel, Bust-A-Move 4 improves on just about every aspect of the game. Returning to the kaleidoscopic spectacle are old-timers Bub and Bob, along with nine totally new characters. Similar to versus modes in other puzzle games, each character has its own strengths and weaknesses based on the type of bubble pattern the character uses to beset opponents. New devices such as pulleys and antigravity blocks have also been added to the puzzle mode and make the single-player experience much more compelling. Pulleys, for instance, add a new dimension of lovable frustration. A pulley consists of two bubble-laden anchor blocks attached to a rope; popping bubbles attached to each anchor block will cause the heavier side to fall and the lighter side to rise. The goal is to get rid of all the bubbles without having one side or the other hit the bottom. As with most puzzle games, Bust-A-Move 4 starts off tame but soon rears its rather difficult head. Other notable twists include antigravity blocks, which tug dropped bubbles back up to the cluster - you\'ll want to avoid them if possible. Most importantly, Bust-A-Move 4\'s versus engine is now equipped with the ""chain reaction"" system. Dropped bubbles will actually home in on other spheres of the same color and pop them, which in turn may drop other bubbles and prolong the chain reaction. With this new system, you can stage devastating combos or quickly turn the tide of victory. For those unfamiliar with chain reactions, you can disable the system. Finally, to prolong the value of Bust-A-Move 4, Taito has implemented a long-overdue level editor to be used in both single- and multiplayer fun. Levels can be transported via memory cards so you can easily bring the challenge with you. Keeping in the tradition of previous games in the series, Bust-A-Move 4 sports the same saccharine-sweet anime graphics and likeable character designs. Most of the illustrations and dialogue spoken before and after rounds of bubble battles are mind-boggling, strange, and irresistible. Bub and Bob shift between diametrically opposed emotions so that one minute they\'re gleeful, and the very next frame of animation finds them doleful and sad. The combination of character design and quirky characterization pushes Bub and Bob into dangerous Pikachu territory - for anyone who\'s slightly soft for eccentricity, be prepared to fall in love. The in-game graphics themselves are also bright and enthusiastic. Like previous Bust-A-Moves, there\'s graphical detail to be reaped if you take the time out to look at anything other than where the next bubble\'s gonna fly. The chain-reaction system also bedazzles the eyes with its impressive display of 2D love as clumps of bubbles scurry back and forth across the screen. Sound effects in Bust-A-Move 4 also match the visual charm of the game. Each character has a distinct voice - some freakier than others . The music is delightfully odd. Most of it rattles with excitement and builds up perfectly for a puzzle game. There\'s one song that features a chorus of prattling angelic-sounding children who repeat a chorus as tantalizing as it is hypnotic. Then again, if you\'ve seen Bust-A-Move 3, none of this should be of any surprise. Bust-A-Move 4 is a great diversion from the serious and morose action titles so in vogue as of late. The single-player game has enough characters to achieve a high volume of replay, and for puzzle battles, the multiplayer mode stands among one of the best. Bust-A-Move 4 will be the type of game you play with your non-gaming friends, because it\'s got so much character and because puzzle games are always respectable. Be warned, however, Bust-A-Move 4 is also extremely addictive... ah, what the heck, indulge yourself.<i>--Staff</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

NFL Xtreme 2,,"['30 NFL teams, create and manage players, customize a team, over 350 motion captured animations, fast arcade-style gameplay, 4 playing modes']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['NFL XTREME 2 has four modes of play: Quick Start, Season, Playoffs, and Tournament. The game also has a plethora of extra roster features including a Create-A-Player option, roster depth charts, player management options, and even a build-your-own-team feature. You can dole out serious damage to other players, as you swing opponents by their arms, do flips over each other, and even pick them up and body slam them! You can also talk plenty of trash or show your best moves with the special celebration moves. NFL XTREME 2 is based on the NFL GAMEDAY engine, resulting in a game that is both fun to play and nice to look at.', 'The original NFL Xtreme was a confusing mess - half NFL Blitz rip-off, half NFL Gameday, and all horrible. The arcade-style gameplay just didn\'t mesh with some of the more simulation-style aspects of the game. People who wanted fast-action football just bought Blitz, while people who enjoyed ""real"" football gravitated towards Gameday or Madden. NFL Xtreme 2 is just as confusing of a package as its predecessor was, but the resulting game at least approaches competency this time around.', 'The game is still a five-on-five affair, and it still has a deep playbook - so deep, in fact, that it will easily scare away players who aren\'t proficient in other football games. The defense is the largest offender here. What exactly does the Man Up defense do that Bail doesn\'t? Which plays work well against the run? If you couldn\'t figure this out in other sim-style football games, there aren\'t any clues to be had here. The offense is a bit more clear-cut, and thanks to its simplistic ""hit any button and we\'ll throw to an open receiver automatically"" option, anyone can pick it up and complete a few passes against the CPU player. Set the difficulty up, and you\'ll have to get slightly more creative with your play selection, but finding an open man still isn\'t much of a challenge, considering the game does that for you. You can still hit X and bring up an icon-based passing system if you want more control over your passing game. Once you\'ve got the ball, and you\'re running up-field with it, there\'s a few snazzy moves you can pull off, but other than the forward flip, which you can use to hop over defenders, these moves don\'t bring much to the game. The game has depth in its options, which include season play, playoffs, tournaments, and a roster-building system. You can run an NFL draft, create players, release players, or trade them to other teams. You also have slight control over the game speed and player size.', 'Graphically, the game has improved, though it still just looks odd. The player models look a bit misshapen, and the animation is pretty choppy. The game\'s frame rate fluctuates quite a bit at times, running really smoothly during close-up, lower poly scenes like kickoffs, but once it zooms out, the frame rate becomes noticeably lower. This makes it much, much harder to get into any sort of rhythm with the game, since you\'re never quite sure how fast or how smooth it\'s going to run on any given play. The sounds include ""real"" taunts from 23 NFL players. These taunts are played after seemingly random plays that the game deems worthy of such snappy ribbings as ""This is a man\'s game,"" or the ever popular ""This is my house!"" The announcer occasionally pipes up during plays with exclamations like ""zips it"" during passes, but he is usually limited to reporting the down and yardage gains.', ""If you're thinking about buying NFL Xtreme 2, the answer is really quite simple. Don't. Fans of Blitz won't dig Xtreme 2's needless roster and playbook depth, and sim-style-football fans will quickly tire of the simple AI and simpler gameplay style. If you're looking for a game that successfully mixes both schools of thought, keep on looking. That game simply hasn't been made yet - and perhaps it should stay that way. --Jeff Gerstmann <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

I couldn\'t imagine sitting down to a friendly game of poker or whist without having a Hoyle rule book handy for the inevitable disputes. But Hoyle Word Games is a collection that provides a nice range of challenges for the word-hungry rather than for the card shark. Although it has plenty of difficulty levels and head-to-head options, the success of Hoyle Word Games is in its simplicity.', ""It's very easy to get started with Hoyle Word Games. That is, if you can ever settle on choosing an in-game persona. In fact, the new face maker feature is one of the most enjoyable parts of the game. It took me at least 15 minutes before I finally settled on a cowgirl picture and actually started playing. Sierra has added graphics and sound affects to all the games, but they're merely window dressing on the old favorites. You can easily change your options, including music and backgrounds on some games."", ""The game suite contains eight different word games. Five are easily recognizable versions of old classics: anagrams, hangman, word searches, crosswords, and enigma (a simple letter-substitution code-breaking game). DoubleCross is a twist on Scrabble, while Word Yacht resembles Boggle. The last game, Speedy Racer, is merely a test of your touch-typing skills and not really a word game at all. In addition to the eight games is perhaps Hoyle Word Games' handiest feature of all: an online version of the complete Webster's New World College Dictionary. It comes in handy while playing the games, and it is a great reference to have around."", ""Some of the games are naturally suited for individual players. The crossword puzzles vary in difficulty, and the clues are traditional, not cryptic. Adding and editing letters are simple. If you are a fan of traditional crosswords, Hoyle's single-player version will have your brain sharpened up in no time. And don't worry about running into the same crosswords - there are 500 different crossword puzzles included in the game."", ""Anagrams is another single-player game. The object is to take a scrambled word and see how many other words you can make with the letters, in addition to discovering the entire, original word. You have to race the clock to get a minimum number of words. Once you've met the minimum, you can keep going for more words until the timer runs out."", ""If you like solving codes, you'll like Enigma, which is named after the famous German WWII encoding device. The game involves simple letter substitution, and it's great if you are good at pattern recognition. It's fortunate that the game doesn't actually replicate the original, which used randomly wired rotors to create its codes."", ""While the single-player Hoyle word games are enjoyable, the real fun begins in the multiplayer games. Whether you test your skill against the computer or human opponents, it's easy to find yourself giving up a couple of hours at a time to a Word Yacht or DoubleCross session. Word Yacht pits you against one, two, or three opponents in a Boggle-like word-making competition. But Word Yacht has a unique twist: In addition to making words from the ten letters, you must also fill certain categories to score. Once you've finished finding all your words, you must choose a category to score in. For example, if you've found lots of three-letter words and have a high score in that category, you'd choose it. The trick is scoring high in each category, though scoring in some is more difficult than in others. This extra twist gives a much more competitive feel to the game. I learned quickly that it's a good idea to practice up through the difficulty levels before challenging anyone on the online Won.net servers."", ""While I enjoyed Word Yacht, Scrabble lovers will have even more fun with DoubleCross. DoubleCross has some fairly complicated rules, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be bombing your opponents' words and racking up the points in no time. As in Scrabble, you place your letter tiles on the board and score points for each complete word you make. Unlike Scrabble, you can also place partial words to be completed later by you or another player. You can also customize the board with special spaces, such as blocking tiles and bombs. Because there are many special rules, it's a good idea to carefully read the opening tutorial, so you can begin to master all the game's intricacies."", ""The main drawback of Hoyle Word Games is its lack of variety and originality. If you're looking for a way to play classic word games on your PC for a short diversion, then it's a great collection. You'll be satisfied with the anagrams, crosswords, word searches, and enigma puzzles for quite a while. But if you're looking for unique word games, you'll keep coming back to Word Yacht and DoubleCross and may soon find your attention wandering unless you get involved with some exciting online opponents. Nevertheless, Hoyle Word Games is a slick package of word puzzles that includes everything you could expect and even a few unique twists on some old favorites. -- <i>Nicole Freeman</i> <br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

In the end, William Rosecrans\'s Army of the Cubmberland overpowered Braxton Bragg\'s Confederates, forcing them to retreat ingloriously toward Chattanooga.

WWF War Zone,,"['nintendo 64', 'wwf war zone', 'wrestling']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['wrestling game wwf war zone nintendo 64', ""Professional wrestling is huge. People who cut their teeth on the Rock and Wrestling era of the WWF are returning in droves, and the industry is doing better than it ever has before. Games based on wrestling have progressed through the years, and while WWF War Zone plays similarly to its predecessors, it presents a package that is completely unmatched in both gameplay and in atmosphere. The result is a game that easily qualifies as the best wrestling game on the N64. <P>Most of the WWF's biggest stars are represented, including Steve Austin, the Undertaker, Kane, Mankind, the Rock, Triple H, and Ken Shamrock. Since the beginning of the game's development, Bret Hart, Ahmed Johnson, and the British Bulldog have left the WWF, but they remain in the game. Hidden wrestlers are also in the game, in the form of Mankind's other personalities, Dude Love and Cactus Jack. There is a fairly extensive create-a-wrestler option, but you're limited to picking entire move sets, instead of picking each move. <P>There are several different modes in War Zone. The challenge mode is the game's main mode, putting your wrestler in a quest to win the championship belt. Along the way you'll be challenged to grudge matches by the wrestlers you've wronged during your career. These grudge matches come in the form of two of the game's other modes. Weapons matches are falls-anywhere, no-rules kinds of matches, where smacking your opponent with a two-by-four and suplexing him onto a table are the order of the day. The cage match forces you to beat your opponent, then climb out of the cage while he's too dazed to do anything about it. Once you've won the belt in challenge mode, the game continues with you defending the belt against various challengers. Gauntlet mode pits you against multiple wrestlers, one at a time, much like a fighting game survival mode. The Royal Rumble is a lot like the real thing, where you must throw your opponents over the top rope to eliminate them, and more wrestlers come to take their place, but the maximum number of men in the ring is four instead of the real Rumble's 30. There is also a really good tag-team mode that contains most of the four-man action from the real thing. Multiplayer modes include a free-for-all, cooperative cage matches, and tornado mode. There is also a training mode, but it isn't as useful as the manual would have you believe. <P>War Zone plays, essentially, like every other wrestling game out there. But the control has been refined to a point of perfection, and a complicated tie-up system keeps people from doing cheap, low-damage moves over and over again. The game controls very tightly, and while you will do some button mashing to add damage to your holds, as well as break your opponent's holds and pins, it is kept to a minimum. It's good to see wrestling games move away from the button-mashing style that has plagued them (and the controllers that played them) for years. Speaking of the controller, the N64 controller really wasn't cut out for this kind of action. You're forced to use all of the C buttons, and the analog stick really isn't worth using. The digital pad, however, does the job. <P>The graphics in War Zone are really, really good. Some of the characters (the Undertaker, for instance) look eerily like their real-life counterparts, although a few of the other characters' faces (Triple H) look a little weird. The sound effects are really good - all the grunts and screams were recorded by the real wrestlers. The game features wrestlers' entrance music, but the N64's pitiful MIDI rendering of the tracks is very, very weak. The two-man announce team of Vince McMahon and Jim Ross is good, but the cartridge's lack of storage space limits the number of phrases when compared to the PlayStation version. However, there is still a good amount of varience in the commentary. <P>WWF War Zone is long on gameplay but really lacks on the atmosphere side. While the wrestlers taunt during matches, their personalities never really come across. While it may have two modes that the PlayStation version doesn't have, the PlayStation has more style to it and puts on a better show than the N64 version, even with its slightly pixelated (though still great) graphics. Still, if graphics and gameplay modes are all you care about, the N64 version is the way to go. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

This  fast action game captures the feeling of playing with Hot Wheels cars  and the most deluxe track set ever imagined. While retaining some  elements of a video game racer, <i>Hot Wheels</i> manages to shun the  current trend toward real-world physics and instead focuses on wild  airborne stunts and wondrously loopy track design.', ""Like most racing games, the idea is to finish first. However, to win  you must pull off some acrobatic maneuvers such as barrel rolls and  somersaults to gain turbo boost rewards and blast past your opponents.  Keeping a third-person viewpoint and simplistic controls, <I>Hot Wheels  Turbo Racing</I> provides just the right touch to re-create the  experience of zooming your own Hot Wheels cars around the living room.  The addition of moody, thematic track backgrounds and scorching sound  and visual effects transforms every toy-playing kid's fantasy world  into a digital reality. <i>--Jeff Young</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b><br> <ul> <li>Simplistic controls and outrageous stunts make the game perfect for  all skill levels <li>Real Hot Wheels cars and inspired tracks make the game shine </ul>', ""<b>Cons:</b><br> <ul> <li>Not a hard core racing simulation fan's game </ul>"", ""Forget about the collectors value. Hot Wheels were meant to be taken out of their packaging, pushed around, wrecked, and driven off makeshift cliffs that consisted of your couch cushions. Hot Wheels Turbo Racing captures the look and feel of those popular little cars and manages to deliver a surprisingly excellent gaming experience along the way. <P>At first glance, it's easy to dismiss Hot Wheels Turbo Racing as just another racing game. It's got the standard options, including car and track select, a practice mode, and some championship races. But the cars and tracks are what make it so different. The cars, all modeled after real-life Hot Wheels cars from the past and present, look really good, right down to the wheels. The tracks are filled with lots of tight twists and turns, as well as some loops and corkscrews thrown in for good measure. On top of that, a good portion of the road on these tracks actually look like actual Hot Wheels track pieces. Plus, the tracks have been designed with lots of big jumps and several shortcuts to help keep things interesting. <P>The big jumps aren't just for show, either. When you catch air, you can pull all kinds of crazy stunts. The better the stunt, the more turbo boosts you earn. With some of the more stunt-oriented cars, you can do all kinds of helicopter spins, barrel rolls, and backflips. Combining the three types of spins in the same stunt is where you really start to earn lots of turbo. The physics of the game really makes jumping, driving, and pulling off big stunts a real blast. <P>Graphically, Hot Wheels Turbo Racing puts on a pretty good show. Sure, it could be a little bit faster and a little bit cleaner, but they definitely get the point across, and they don't get in the way of the gameplay. The sound effects are filled with all types of tire squeals, engines, and explosions, but the music is a really nice touch. The soundtrack features songs by Primus, Metallica, Meat Beat Manifesto, and Mix Master Mike. <P>It's a shame that many will underestimate Hot Wheels Turbo Racing just because it's got the toy car license attached to it. The driving is great, and the stunt aspect of the game gives it a skateboard-like feel. It's definitely poised to become a sleeper hit. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

As if that was not official enough for die-hard dirt bikers, there  are realistic racetracks to conquer, including Sam Boyd Stadium, Red  Bud, and Glen One.', ""The game designers paid particular attention to recreating rugged track  and bike conditions that muddy up (literally) an otherwise clean racing  experience. For example, your bike must avoid puddles that haven't  quite dried up. Expect to get dirty; during our test of this game, we  found it to be nearly impossible to avoid getting our virtual bikes  caked with mud."", 'Two players can face off in a single race or, if you prefer, you can  race for a whole season to accumulate titles and cash prizes for bike  upgrades. If you conquer the realistic tracks contained in the game,  you can design 20 monster tracks with the track editor. This feature  allows you to create your own hairpin turns, giant jumps, and deep  pits. <i>--Carrie Bell</i>', '<b>Pros:</b><br />', '<b>Cons:</b><br />', '', ""As supercross and other forms of dirt-bike racing gain popularity, you can be sure that game companies will pick up on the trend and unleash a slew of dirt-bike racing titles. We've already seen a few PlayStation games, like Acclaim's Jeremy McGrath Supercross series and THQ's Championship Motocross Featuring Ricky Carmichael. 989 Studios is getting into the act with SuperCross Circuit, a fast-moving game with real-life tracks, equipment, and professional riders."", ""The thing that really sets SuperCross Circuit apart from other dirt-bike games is its speed. The game runs at a nice, fast pace, and maintains a reasonably high frame rate throughout the one- and two-player modes, even when there are several bikes on the screen at once. The bikes are also very easy to control with the analog pad and three main buttons, used for gas, brake, and goosing the throttle for a quick speed burst. You'll want to goose the throttle on the face of most of the jumps to maximize your air. Getting big air not only lets you fly over certain obstacles, but it's key in the game's freestyle mode, where you score points by doing tricks. The trick system centers around the L2 and R2 buttons. Different presses on the D-pad in conjunction with presses on the back shoulder buttons lets you select from several different tricks."", ""Aside from the freestyle mode, which must be unlocked, you've got a quick-and-dirty arcade mode, a practice mode, and a season mode. Season mode lets you name your rider, pick out what type of clothes he'll be wearing, and race all the game's tracks. As you race, you'll earn money, which can be used to purchase new bikes, as well as to upgrade engines, exhaust systems, tires, and suspension. Also, parts on your bike will wear out as you race, so you'll occasionally need to repair existing parts. As you complete seasons, you'll be able to move up from 125cc to 250cc bikes. You can create both freestyle and standard racetracks with the game's track editor, which gives you a grid and a list of track parts. It works pretty well, but there are already 25 tracks in the game, so you won't feel forced to create tracks to have a good time. You can, of course, save tracks to a memory card and race them in one- or two-player exhibition races."", ""SuperCross Circuit's textures occasionally look a little too pixilated at times, but it's a worthwhile trade-off when you take into account the sheer speed of the game and the playability that speed provides. Three camera angles let you see the action from behind the rider, the handlebars, and behind the bike. The standard behind-the-bike view is nice, but it can get extremely confusing out of the starting gate, where all the bikes are onscreen and jockeying for position. The game does a good job of emulating the buzzing sound of loud dirt bikes, but that doesn't mean it's not terribly annoying."", ""Speed, easy control, and lots of tracks make SuperCross Circuit a whole lot of fun for one or two players. Fans of the sport will enjoy the real riders, tracks, and equipment, but the game is simple enough for anyone to pick up and play, regardless of the person's interest in supercross racing. --Jeff Gerstmann <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Each week's show features a course that matches a character from THE SIMPSONS cartoon series: Apu has a full-on obstacle course set up in the Kwik-E-Mart on one level, while Robosaurus lords over another. Almost every character that's ever appeared on the animated series is worked into the mix in this brilliant trek through all things Springfield, and the game show format is a great way to mix original gameplay with classic SIMPSONS locales and personalities. Matt Groening fans and gamers alike can get into this one.""]","by

NBA Jam 99 - Nintendo 64,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Cart Only in good shape clean with a full label. Cart may show small signs of wear such as a few scratches or scuffs but no major flaws. All ClassicGameStore games are fully tested before being placed into inventory', 'Acclaim and Iguana have pulled off the video game equivalent of a Ricki Lake talk-show makeover with NBA Jam 99, dressing it up with plenty of new game features and adding five-on-five simulation gameplay. This will come as bad news for gamers hoping to relive the glory days of ""Phi Slamma Jamma."" But for players who think NBA Jam\'s fire burned out long ago, this newest incarnation for the Nintendo 64 takes a positive leap in providing a realistic, in-depth, and mostly enjoyable basketball experience.', ""NBA Jam 99 is actually two and a half games in one, so the best way to review this game is to address each one separately. The game's bread and butter is its NBA play simulation mode. It's rich in features and options, the most notable being a fantasy draft in which you can rebuild the NBA with custom rosters, then trade and create players under a bonus points cap. The 80-plus plays are easy to customize and call on the fly."", ""The game plays well as a sim, if a little on the slow side. The control is very responsive, and the inclusion of icon passing and special-situation options caters to most gamers' playing styles. For instance, the ability to call for a screen is so easy that I found myself using it at least once every offensive trip. The computer AI on both sides of the ball is sharp: Computer players are aggressive stealers and shot blockers, plus there's lots of movement off the ball. Still, there's room for improvement. The free-throw shooting method gets points for originality, but it's an analog-based style that may irritate some gamers. Also, there's apparently no option to switch to the defender closest to the ball; instead you have to toggle through the roster, which is a burden."", 'The second ""game"" is the jam mode, a more challenging five-on-five affair that adds the spectacular dunks, special moves, on-fire players, and wacky comments synonymous with NBA Jam. Now, Acclaim touts this mode as an added ""bonus,"" so it\'s hard to knock it. Still, if Acclaim\'s going to call it Jam Mode, it better live up to its billing. It doesn\'t: It\'s basically an over-the-top sim mode with added bells and whistles. That\'s not a bad thing, but it plays too slow and dull to be enjoyable for extended periods. You\'d be sorely mistaken to think this game offers anything close to the original arcade.', 'The ""half"" game is the skills mode, essentially two minigames. The three-point contest is fairly fun, especially as a multiplayer event, while the free throw shooting is there more for practice purposes.', ""In terms of presentation, it's clear Iguana knows hi-res graphics. The stadiums and court floors are more than adequate visually. The players, while still slightly boxy, are animated well. Plus there's enough room in the memory to actually put a ref on the floor during fouls and tip-off. There are notable instances of slowdown, such as on some special move animations, but they don't hamper gameplay flow to a great extent. As far as sound goes, the good news is that there's a great deal of two-man commentary from Kevin Harlan and Bill Walton, especially given the N64's limits. The bad news is that occasionally they'll blurt out incorrect phrases or serve up a bit too much chatter."", ""For gamers doing comparison shopping, here's my two cents: NBA Jam 99's many extra features and gameplay modes give it a strong edge over NBA Courtside - especially for hoops-sim junkies who want to build fantasy franchises and their own players. It certainly has enough moxie to hang with NBA Live 99 but not enough to dethrone that solid title so easily. The two titles borrow so much from each other this season that neither currently has hand in their relationship."", 'Those looking for a well-rounded hoops sim won\'t go wrong with the solidly built NBA Jam 99. If Iguana can address its minor slowdown and sound glitches, plus pump up the fun and intensity of the Jam-style gameplay to match its arcade predecessor, this title\'s sequel has the potential to be the next ""it"" game in the genre. --Nelson Taruc <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Ncaa Gamebreaker 2000: Playstation 1,,"['Platform: Sony Playstation', 'ESRB Rating: E - Everyone']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""At first glance, NCAA Gamebreaker 2000 might not look or sound too different from last year's game, but once you sit down and play the game for any length of time you'll realize that the design team beefed up the game's features and its authenticity. <P>This higher level of authenticity is demonstrated by the game's plays, which were designed by Bob Toledo, head coach of UCLA and Pac-10 coach of the year. The plays themselves are quite different from anything you'd find in a NFL licensed game, even Gameday 2000. The unique plays are a nice change of pace for anyone who has played countless NFL games with the usual plays and formations we've seen a hundred times.  <P>Whether you like the plays or not, Gamebreaker 2000 has a play editor that among other things lets you assign routes to all your receivers. The play editor is fairly intuitive and comprehensive, although it's pretty structured, so it won't let you do anything too crazy. <P>If you enjoy making plays in the play editor, then the new career mode might be right up your alley. This feature lets you test your skills as a coach at a small school. You'll help build that team up and play the season. Also, depending on your team's accomplishments in the area you coach, you could get a promotion or a better job offer from another school. However, if your team falls short at the end of the season you could get fired. This new feature is interesting and in-depth, and it will surely hold the attention of hard-core simulation fans who enjoy added extras like this for quite some time. Casual fans who simply enjoy the game's fast-paced action will probably try this once and quickly dismiss it. Other GM-type options include creating players and a playbook. In addition, once you get through the season, you can transfer your graduating seniors via a memory card to your roster on NFL Gameday 2000.   <P>The recruiting feature is also back and is very similar to the one in last year's title. You can pick through the list of players and select those who look as though they could be the best candidates for the position. It's not quite as in depth as the feature in Electronic Arts' NCAA Football 2000, but it gets the job done.  <P>One of the most unnecessary new additions to Gamebreaker 2000 is the celebration and show-off animations. Right after a play is complete you can celebrate, show off, or hurry to the huddle. I can understand the option to celebrate after a good play, but to be able to do it after every play - even when you throw an incomplete pass - is kind of odd. Sure, the ability to do this doesn't detract from the game, but it does seem kind of silly. The one thing that I can't understand is why the game has the show-off button, the show-off animations aren't that different from the celebration animations, and the refs call unsportsman-like conduct on you every time, costing you fifteen yards. <P>As with any good multiyear football game, the AI has to be improved from year to year, and the designers of Gamebreaker 2000 did just that. The offensive-line blocking and defensive coverage is a little smarter, and the computer doesn't let your players get too far away from the defenders , making you work a bit harder to complete a pass. On defense, it seems as though your cornerbacks have a tendency to be in just the right place more often than not to get a pick. Overall, the AI seems a little quicker and smarter, although for experienced players of NCAA Gamebreaker 99, the computer won't seem that difficult. Also, a lot of the plays that had holes in them last year have either been removed or tweaked. <P>The gameplay and control are mostly the same as last year's model, which is great since the total control passing and running game of NCAA Gamebreaker 2000 is still one of the most exciting and fun systems of any football game. In addition to this, the ability to choose whether you want to play the game with advanced or simplified controls is great. You're given the option when you're first learning the basic control scheme so you can have a chance to familiarize yourself with the game and bust off some moves without having to learn too much. Then, once you're comfortable, you have the ability to switch to the advanced controls for more precise control. Overall, the control doesn't feel that much different from last year's version; it just feels as though it's a little tighter and more in sync with some of the animations.  <P>Visually, NCAA Gamebreaker 2000 is a little cleaner than the last game. The collision detection of the players could still be better, since the players are constantly walking through and into each other. While it doesn't bother me much post-play, I find it terribly frustrating during the action - especially when tackling. The only other thing that still bothers me about the game is that the players still look as though they're sliding atop the turf while juking. While the clipping and turf sliding are bothersome, they don't really detract from the otherwise smooth and bright graphics of Gamebreaker 2000.  <P>In the audio department, the game seems on par with last year's title. Keith Jackson provides the play-by-play calls, which are still fresh and keep up with the action quite well. The sound effects, crowd sound, and accompanying ambient music really add to the whole college-football atmosphere.  <P>In the end, Gamebreaker 2000 is a decent improvement over last year's title. Casual fans may not notice all the little nuances, plays, and animations, but fans of the Gamebreaker series surely will. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Also, depending on the difficulty setting, the track will be adorned with various obstacles that force you to steer a little more precisely. There are six characters to choose from, each with different attributes. The elephant is strong, the bull can turn very well, while the zebra is the all-around racer. There are also hidden boss characters in the game, which are unlocked by beating challenge mode on the hardest setting. Aside from the challenge mode, there's also a circuit mode, a time trial mode (which allows you to race against your best time), and a single-race mode."", ""The gameplay in Running Wild is surprisingly fun. There is a variety of speed-ups and other power-ups on the track, some of which will make you bigger, allowing you to simply stomp your competition. Others will give you weapons. But the speed power-ups are the most important, as they'll increase your top speed. If you go through a race without collecting any of them, you have no hope of winning."", 'The graphics in Running Wild are simple, yet effective. The characters and tracks have a very Warner Bros. look to them, and the game runs at a very high frame rate. The smooth frame rate really gives the game a nice feeling of speed.

All-Star Baseball 2000,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['It includes only cartridge N64 Game All-Star Baseball 2000 for use with Nintendo 64 Game System Tag back has a superimposed bar code label', ""The All Star Baseball series has far and away been the best baseball game series on the N64. This year, Acclaim and Iguana have continued the tradition by adding new gameplay features and refinements, keeping this year's version in top shape. The new batting features are by far the most impressive addition to this year's game. The new options let you guess which zone the pitch will be thrown to, as well as the type of pitch. If you guess correctly, your contact target will get bigger, giving you a better chance of hitting the ball. However, if you guess the pitch incorrectly, your contact target will get smaller, decreasing your chance of hitting the ball. In addition to this, you can now change the angle at which your contact target faces the pitcher, so you can basically choose where you'd like to hit the ball. You can angle it left to hit the ball into left field, up toward the sky for a pop up, or toward the ground for a grounder. Of course, you must do everything just right, meaning timing the pitch and getting the batting target on the pitch as it comes in. If you're familiar with the All Star series then you already know about the hi-res graphics that give the game its amazingly realistic look; for those who aren't, let me explain. Put simply, All Star Baseball 2000 is far and away the most visually impressive baseball game ever. The animations of the players running, walking up to the plate, diving, and everything else look so incredibly lifelike it's ridiculous. The game has an overall crisp look that, combined with unbelievably smooth polygonal player models, makes the game look more like a CG intro than an actual playable game. The new instant-replay mode in All Star Baseball 2000 really lets you zoom in and take a look at the players in action from any angle you want. This is great since on more than one occasion base runners sliding into third have been called safe when they were obviously, painfully not. We've also seen, on more frequent occasions, outfielders catching balls they weren't anywhere near. Aside from these cases, no other AI problems were apparent; all the AI and stat issues from last year have been fixed. In the audio department, All Star Baseball 2000 still leaves something to be desired. The game's play-by-play action and color commentary, provided by New York Yankee broadcasters John Sterling and Michael Kay, isn't all that great: A lot of the same phrases seem to come up. Triple Play 2000 had a little bit more variety in the commentary. The dull voice-work in All Star Baseball 2000 seems to be even more noticeable, since it's really all you have. The crowd is nearly silent, and the organ music might as well be, since it hardly ever comes on. Like the other games in the series, ASB 2000 holds the MLB license, so it features all 30 of the real major league baseball teams and all the real players. There is a total of four different game modes to play in - exhibition, season, play-off, and home run derby. Overall, All Star Baseball 2000 is a refined version of last year's game. However, the new features and refinements totally add up; they make picking up All Star Baseball 2000 a must for every N64-owning baseball fan.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Worms: Armageddon,,"['worms', 'nintendo 64']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['Do you ever wonder what all of those worms squirming around subterranean  tunnels are scheming? We do, too. As it turns out, according to <i>Worms  Armageddon</i>, our wacky segmented friends have a stockpile of crazy weapons and  are waging a war big enough to turn the world into a heaping compost pile. Who  knew?', '<i>Worms Armageddon</i> brings the humorously addictive gameplay of the very  popular <i>Worms</i> series to the Nintendo 64 for the first time. The strategy-based  gameplay is as unique as the premise. Commanding a team of worms, players wriggle  and shoot through 30 missions and 14 training levels. Players take turns moving a worm  warrior into position and then firing at the opposing team, using an arsenal of weapons  ranging from mines and kamikaze attacks to the more traditional exploding sheep attack  and banana bombs. Naturally, the commander who best combines strategic moves with  creative attacks wins the worm war.', ""Join the throngs of fans of this unique game series and you'll never look at a grinning,  gun-toting earthworm in the same way again. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", 'Do you ever wonder what worms do in their free time? The third chapter of the popular Worms series, Worms Armageddon, has you believe that instead of just hiding under rocks and floating down storm drains, worms are actually ruthless militant creatures with boyish British accents that constantly fight each other. This simple, somewhat innocent premise sets the stage for an excellent turn-based strategy game, as Worms Armageddon is not only the best Worms game, it\'s also an incredible multiplayer experience. The concept is pretty simple: You control a team of well-armed worms, and your objective is to kill the other worms any way you can. You do this on a 2D plane that\'s usually a series of odd platforms and objects precariously placed over deadly water. (Worms can\'t swim.) The combat itself takes place in a series of timed turn-based rounds that seamlessly flow into each other. Each of your worms shares a collective arsenal from which you can choose all sorts of weapons - from the devastatingly serious to the laughably wacky. From there, you switch to a manual aiming and firing scheme used to unleash your weapon of choice at the worm you\'re targeting. This leads to all sorts of havoc, as combat tends to lend itself to poorly aimed explosives and the fun effects they cause. The worms and everything around them have a distinctly animated look to them. Big eyes and oddly shaped household items show the comic-strip influence of the graphics, and combined with the simple 2D layout, it makes Worms Armageddon something of a throwback to the old school. The detail is simple but effective, and it helps support the humorous themes running through the game\'s elements. Switching to more offbeat weapons will generally change your character\'s appearance - a worm will don a headband before administering a dragon punch, and a worm armed with a battle-ax is also outfitted with a Viking helmet. Explosions and animations are simple - worms shuffle along when you\'re moving them, and explosives blow up within a pretty obvious radius. Still, more detail to some animations, such as the shotgun fire, could have provided Worms with a bit more graphical prowess and, in turn, could have helped sort out exactly where the blast hit (or missed). A serious humor element is added to the gameplay in the form of the worms hysterical speech. Unfortunately, the N64 version doesnt allow you to set what type of accent your worms speak in, and instead simply randomizes the speech patterns of your worms. So the computer decides which of your worms will be a redneck, which will be British, and which will be Asian. Squeaky, high-pitched speech fills the game with colorful comments from your worm army as you play. If a live grenade is tossed next to you, your worm will scream, ""Run for it."" If it completely misses, your worm will ask, ""What was that?"" This effect is only mildly cute and strictly tiptoes the fine line of being annoying. Other sound effects - such as explosions, bouncing grenades, and submachine gun fire - are done well and lend a bit of realism to an otherwise unrealistic experience. Mild, almost unnoticeable music plays in the background and helps you focus on the task at hand. The only particularly bad thing about the audio is the German beer commercial-like Euro-dance that pulses over the title screen. Still, a few button presses, and this is all but forgotten. It\'s the weapons in this game that make it really fun. Every combat game may have grenades and shotguns, but not a whole lot of them have pneumatic drills, ninja ropes, supersheep, and sticks of dynamite. This huge assortment of instruments used to deal out the pain keeps things fairly fresh and funny, as each weapon has its own silly effect. Still, there are some weapons that are just too powerful, and once you\'ve mastered them, they have a countereffect on the gameplay. On top of that, instead of switching off between worms, the turn system switches off between teams - meaning a team with a single worm will get four turns before all four worms on the other team get a turn. This makes it unduly difficult to kill the last worm on a team, as he easily gets a tactical advantage with his multiple turns. It\'s terribly frustrating to be killed before you can even get a shot off.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Hydro Thunder,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games']",{},"['Cartridge only with minor wear.', 'Hydro Thunder is one of those games that prove that timing is everything. The game was rushed to the Dreamcast so that it could have the advantage of being one of the few reasonably good games available at launch, and it ended up being a beautiful, if not painfully exact, arcade port. Now, more than half a year later, the game has landed on the N64. While it\'s obvious the developers spent more time making this version of Hydro Thunder cleaner and more user friendly, without the graphical muscle of the arcade hardware or the Dreamcast, the N64 version simply isn\'t as impressive. Aesthetics aside, the game hasn\'t changed at all from the Dreamcast version. You\'re still racing one of nine different boats across 12 different courses in an attempt to place first. Along the way you\'ll run into various obstacles, collect boosters, make insanely huge jumps, and do your best to keep your boat afloat. This game has only two modes - play on your own or play with a friend. There\'s no time trial, no tournament, no battle or practice mode, just the pay-per-race-styled ""game"" mode that you\'re already familiar with. Still, the user interface has been much improved, and it now sports a ""restart race"" command from the pause menu and offers a more comprehensive option menu. Unfortunately, the N64 version doesn\'t let you completely customize your controls and instead makes you pick one of two different preset control schemes, none of which emulates the controls of the Dreamcast version. This makes it almost impossible to pull off boost jumps, as the boost button is now nowhere near the brakes. Also the boats in this version seem to be almost weightless, as they float all over the screen at the slightest bump. You\'ll be impressed by how well the graphics translate from the arcade onto the N64. While they\'re not perfect, the graphics, in general, look very nice. Unfortunately, a lot of the effects are missing, and sometimes the water looks plain awful. But the most noticeable problem is how badly the frame rate suffers, as you literally trudge along at points. What was once a fast and furious arcade racer has turned into a slow, dawdling trip through the courses, all of which seem much longer this time around. Another department that suffered heavy losses is the audio department. While the in-game music is pretty much the same, the audio cues from your navigator and the engine noises are very low quality. Now all the boats pretty much sound the same, and the sound effects are rather generic. While some areas of the game have been improved, the incredibly frustrating AI hasn\'t been. It\'s still the case that the computer-controlled opponents are faster or slower depending on which boat you select. If you choose a faster, more difficult boat to control, you\'ll be up against faster opponents. This makes it a bit lopsided, as you get none of the pros but all of the cons inherent in choosing a more difficult boat. So, in short, the best boats to select are the slowest ones, unless you\'re less concerned with winning the race than you are with placing the fastest time. Perhaps the most frustrating element of Hydro Thunder is the outright difficulty. You always start in 15th place, and the only way you can win a race is by hitting every boost, taking every shortcut, and hitting no walls. As if that weren\'t enough, Hydro Thunder retains the time gates - an arcade element. This makes finding shortcuts more accidental than intentional, as you\'ve no time to stop and explore the track. Most of the details present in the Dreamcast version were sacrificed, replaced with only a few minor interface improvements. While the N64 version is definitely prettier than its PlayStation counterpart, the sluggish racing keeps Hydro Thunder from being even half as much fun as it was in arcades, and the lack of other modes keeps the gameplay from being interesting.  <I>--Ben Stahl </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Battlezone 64: Rise of the Black Dogs - Nintendo 64,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""The 1980 arcade classic <i>Battlezone</i> gulped quarters by the pocketful, but always left virtual tank gunners satisfied with its simple, yet engaging first-person style. In 1998, Activision brilliantly refitted the game into a 3-D strategic combat game for the PC, and now Climax/Crave offers N64 gamers a chance to share in the game's new groove."", ""<i>Battlezone 64</i> introduces a bevy of new twists on the old theme. Players choose between three modes: arcade, pilot, and commander. The arcade variation most closely resembles the original's gameplay, namely shoot anything and everything that may resemble an enemy until it blows up. The second mode sends players on tasks provided by a mission commander, adding a bit of adventure and responsibility to the mix. The third variation most closely resembles the PC revision's combination of action and strategic gameplay, enabling players to collect vital resources necessary for building new structures and vehicles, and to populate a base with defensive measures and command units. Added bonus: the freedom to jump out of your vehicle, stealthily run to another (30 vehicles in all with over 15 weapons), climb aboard, and battle on. Multiplayer mode allows up to four players to battle, or two players to compete in a more strategic game style. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", ""The year is 1969, and humankind has landed on the moon. In a startling development, US astronauts stumble across a cache of alien weaponry, leading to the largest cover-up in human history. While people at home are led to believe that the trip was uneventful, joint Soviet and US forces amass for military occupation of the moon. Thus follows the plot of Battlezone: Rise of the Black Dogs, the N64 port of a PC game that only vaguely resembles the Battlezone of yore. At the outset, you must decide how you want to play, choosing arcade, pilot, or commander modes. From there, you choose from three factions: American, Soviet, or The Black Dogs, each faction offering 21 separate missions. Then you hop into one of eleven tanks and begin your quest to harness the alien technology. While no side plays much differently than the others, those seeking a truly involving battle simulation will enjoy the game's commander mode, which puts you in total control over unit deployment, strategy, and objectives. If you're just into blatant destruction, the arcade or pilot modes will fulfill any need for catharsis. Battlezone: RotBD plays like a cross between San Francisco Rush, Battletanx, and Quake. Multiton tanks zoom along like souped-up Nissans, while weapons and ammunition expend themselves in amounts reminiscent of WW2. While that might not sound too realistic for a tank game, Battlezone: RotBD actually benefits from these nuances. There are a few slow and dumpy tanks for realism, while faster, more arcade-like models exist for those desiring a less frustrating experience. Though each tank is limited to a small selection of ammo and power-ups, the game's sniper mode offers you the ability to change/steal tanks often - letting gamers experience a greater number of weapons and tanks than were initially available. Unlike the single-player missions, the multiplayer modes will leave you with a bad taste. The four-player deathmatch and race modes are bland and boring, offering little more than brief periods of excitement before depleting the attention span of all involved. The two-player strategy mode offers the potential for multivehicle battle, but it comes out as an even less-varied version of regular deathmatch, minus two other players. It's safe to say that gamers who complete all of the game's single-player missions will have no reason to pick the game up again. Of course, with more than 60 unique missions, this could be a long time coming. Visually, Battlezone: RotBD impresses with diverse vehicles, lens flares, and a healthy dose of particle effects. The backgrounds, albeit spartan, are decently rendered and lack the oft-maligned fog that the Nintendo 64 is known for. The game isn't as pretty as its PC counterpart, and the sniper-mode visuals are laughable in comparison, but the game's graphical quality is definitely a cut above the rest. This doesn't hold true for the multiplayer modes though, as the fog and slowdown rush back in, almost as if to further deter any chance that you will try out the game's multiplayer offerings. Now that those aspects are out of the way, it's time to talk about sound. Actually, it's time to discuss the lack thereof. Single-player background music is repetitive, poor-quality MIDI, and in-game sound effects barely do the job of expressing the action. In addition, the multiplayer levels are so bereft of musical variety that one continues to wonder why they were included at all. In fact, for a 64-bit game, the audio is barely above 8-bit in quality. Suffice it to say, Battlezone: Rise of the Black Dogs is a fun game with good looks that fails to deliver in terms of multiplayer support and audio quality. Anyone who enjoys the thought of space-tank combat coupled with an engaging plot will want to give this title a try, but those hoping to bring their friends in on the action will want to remain far, far away.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

If Kirby swallows an enemy, he can take on its special abilities. For example, Rocky will turn him to stone and KeKe gives him a broom for sweeping enemies off their feet.\nAt various locations throughout the game, Kirby can unite with and hop on characters with different helpful attributes. For example, Kine is a great swimmer, Nago can perform a triple jump, and Coo can fly.

You can transmit and receive secret files with your friends using Game Boy Color's infrared technology (both parties must have a Game Boy Color and <i>Mission: Impossible</i> game to use this feature)."", ""Greetings, fellow gamer. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to traverse your way safely through ten terrorist-filled levels in Infogrames' Mission: Impossible for the Game Boy Color. To aid you in your mission you will have at your disposal: Metal Gear-style gameplay, a visually pleasing game environment, and a diverse array of spy paraphernalia. Oh, and before we forget, don't let the enemy see you, because one hit and you're toast. This paragraph will self-destruct in five seconds. Taken out of context, the above description sounds like it would make for an excellent game. Top-down, Metal Gear-style gameplay is always a safe bet on handhelds. The ability to use a variety of guns, transceivers, stealth devices, and infiltration systems can't hurt either. In addition, vibrant, multicolored graphics and large character sprites usually lend an aura of quality to any game. However, when it comes to Mission: Impossible, the correct ratio of these aspects has been executed improperly. In general, if a weapon or object is available for use when it's needed, that is a sign of proper game balance. Unfortunately, object-use in Mission: Impossible is kept to a minimum, robbing you of one degree of freedom. Furthermore, the effectiveness of your primary weapon is diminished by the fact that using it alerts the attention of every enemy in your area - usually resulting in certain death. Splut, there goes one more degree of freedom. Amusingly, the game manual states that frugal weapons usage can lead to an increased score. But thanks to the risky nature of putting the weapons to use, this bonus isn't difficult to achieve. Even worse, any mistake that brings your character into contact with an enemy causes you to begin the level over again. In early levels, this amounts to only a minute or two of backtracking. In later levels though, upward of 10 or 15 minutes can be wasted by such mistakes. To be sure, a life meter would have been a welcome addition to this game's feature set. Adding to the tedium, each level begins with a textual objectives list that you're expected to follow explicitly. Walk over the bridge, into the house, across the desert, under the lasers, past the guards, through the woods, into the hills, to grandmother's house we go. Due to these strict objectives, Mission: Impossible serves as an example of one of the most linear games ever released. Even more than the lack of a life meter, this forced ennui is going to tax even the most patient of gamers. When it comes to Game Boy Color titles, rarely does a game fail in the gameplay arena while succeeding in the areas of graphics and sound. Somehow, Mission: Impossible manages this feat. Character sprites are nicely drawn, with an animation level that is on par with such recent releases as Bionic Commando and Tomb Raider. As the game progresses, suitable sound effects coupled with catchy Mission: Impossible tunes emanate from the GBC's speaker. In truth, only the most nitpicky of gamers could find fault with the game's multimedia qualities. Unfortunately, while level after level is a treat to behold, playing through them is akin to pulling one's own teeth with vice-grips. Developer Rebellion has included, in addition to the game itself, a clever Game Boy Color technology demonstration within the framework of a built-in Agent Action Kit. This kit, supported by battery backup, lets you store names, addresses, and phone numbers; send and receive infrared messages; and even use the Game Boy as a remote control. It's this last option that has many people buzzing with excitement. Select a button for assignment, point any infrared-based remote control at the GBC's IR port, and press a button on said remote. The GBC will then store a copy of the original signal for later use, letting you power on, power off, change channels, and do everything else a remote would let you do. However, you should be aware that there is a ten-foot limit of effectiveness on the GBC's IR port. As an adventure game, Mission: Impossible seems geared to those hard-core gamers out there who have both the time and the patience to spend replaying level after level until they've finished the game. Those who prefer life meters with their espionage or who are expecting a Metal Gear-ish experience will want to steer clear of this one. However, if you're into quirky and unique game modes or are just curious, the Agent Action Kit does make the game worth a look.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

Andretti Racing: Playstation 1,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""In terms of options and career paths, Mario Andretti Racing takes auto racing to a new level of video game realism. Consulting with Andretti himself through much of the design process, the developers at EA Sports created an excellent user interface with loads of options. The game offers both Stock Car and Formula One racing, which means junkies from both sides of the track can get their fill. An innovative career system allows players to compete for an entire season of harsh racing, and with over 16 different tracks to take on, replay value is guaranteed. The graphics are good, though occasionally marred. Crisp videos dominate the options screens, and a number of graphics tricks are employed during the game to preserve realism (the tracks are completely 3-D, with occasional light-source shading and smoke effects to highlight the experience). Pop-up is visible but minimal. The cars are fairly realistic, and there are nice graphics touches like losing a wheel or breaking a spoiler in the heat of the action. The simplistic controls, which consist mostly of steering, accelerating, and shifting gears, seem great at some times but flawed at others. Steering takes practice, and turning can be disastrous unless the player learns to brake well beforehand. The physics also seem to be a bit off, too. For example, cars have a tendency to float while crashing. But the main question is: where's the speed?  Overall, Mario Andretti Racing is only an average racing game with some realistic perks to push it ahead of the pack. Despite its racing and graphic shortcomings, die-hard Andretti fans (or, for that matter, Stock Car or Formula One fans), should pick it up. Otherwise, leave Andretti by the side of the road.<i>--Chris Gardner</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Moto Racer,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['When I was in high school, a friend of mine came into possession of a brand-new speed bike. We were all shocked when he sold the thing five months after having bought it. ""Too fast,"" he claimed, describing some near-miss situations he\'d experienced on the San Diego freeway. After playing Moto Racer, my friend\'s reasoning has become a bit clearer. Not that Electronic Arts\' latest racing title is toofast. But the gut-turning velocities achieved during parts of the game - and the requirement that your reflexes one-up this pace - is definitely where the challenge lies in Moto Racer.  Essentially two racing games in one, Moto Racer features both dirt and street bikes, with tracks that suit each bike\'s respective racing style. Dirt bikes can race in a classic motocross arena, complete with a crowd that roars each time you successfully clear a mogul or dirt ramp. Later, you\'ll travel to more outrageous environments, skidding out among your competitors in a jungle setting, and finally, performing handstands and triumphant leg kicks midair while negotiating the curves over the Great Wall of China. Street bikes settle for simpler tracks with more straightaways, frequently nearing the 200mph mark on their peaceful, idyllic highways. The running theme in Moto Racer is speed, and the graphics are no exception. The models are so efficiently drawn that even with several opponents tearing up the road at once almost no slowdown is experienced onscreen. Drivers and bikes are all realistically animated and always quick to respond to the motion of your controller. Creating the illusion of track friction - the illusion that what you\'re controlling actually appears to be riding on a surface - is key to creating a believable racing experience. The developers at Delphine have definitely taken this into consideration here. In-game controls consist of your basic direction, accelerate, and brake buttons. A special turbo button is reserved to accelerate over jumps and pass other bikes. Subtle combinations of these buttons need to be mastered in order to race efficiently on each track. You will soon find out that the turbo button needs to be used sparingly, and that braking is essential at certain curves, lest your driver will be sent sliding down the pavement like a helpless rag doll. Sure, any racing game has the tendency to grow old eventually. But Moto Racer gets extra replay points for including a multiplayer option and a thumbs-up for being a racing title worth checking out.<i>--Tim Soete</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

Boom Bots,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Clay animation and video games: Is it a winning combination? Given The Neverhood's track record of developing weak games based on clay animation (the self-titled Neverhood for the PC and Skullmonkeys for the PlayStation), the answer is no. Boombots is yet another game that tries to merge clay with gaming. But unlike Interplay's old and only marginally better Clay Fighter for the SNES, this fighting game has absolutely nothing going for it. Cat aliens have stolen all of Earth's house cats. It's up to you, as one of several goofy-looking robots, to fight other goofy-looking robots until you can return the cats to their rightful homes. The fighting is similar to Midway's abysmal 3D fighter, Bio F.R.E.A.K.S., in that it takes place in a 3D arena. Most of the fighting is based on three types of projectile attacks - correction - the fighting would be about the three types of projectile attacks, but since the computer fighters are so susceptible to being thrown, you can simply run after your opponent while pounding on the R2 button and win every time. You can get out of throws if you're crafty - which the computer player obviously isn't. Against a human, you'll simply stay far away from each other, lobbing projectiles back and forth until you simply can't take any more - depending on your pain threshold, this will be anywhere between five and ten minutes. Graphically, the game looks rough. The textures are plain and ugly, and the effects are just as drab. But the FMV cutscenes, completely rendered in clay, look pretty good, even if they are firmly on the just-plain-stupid side of the humor scale. The soundtrack sounds as though it was ripped from a Genesis game and only adds to the frustration factor. Boombots is without a doubt in the running for the worst game of the year. The fighting is ill-conceived every step of the way, and the presentation doesn't bring anything to the table either. I shouldn't have to tell you to save your money, but just in case you're the type of person who skips to the end of every review, here it is in plain English: Stay as far away from this game as you possibly can.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Game disc is in great condition. If there are any scratches they are only minor and have no effect on game play. All of our games are fully tested prior to being placed in our inventory.', ""I have to give points to Electronic Arts for having the chutzpah to bring the classic turns and turrets sea battle to arcade life in Battlestations, a PlayStation naval combat title whose approach might be called beer and pretzels. This is to say that if you played this title under the assumption that it's like other naval computer games (while consuming beer and pretzels), you might actually get said foodstuffs lodged up your nose in laughter or panic. Unlike two-player action in 'Campaign' and 'War Game,' this is an arcade game - a real-time Battleship for the 90s, if you will. <P>Hallowed naval tactics? Guess again. Opposing vessels - we're talking modern-era aircraft carriers and battlecruisers - begin their engagements at ranges better suited to Estes rockets than Exocet missiles, and the circling-camera intro pan might as well have the caption FIGHT! in blood-drenched capital letters. Challenging aquadynamics? Forget it. The ships maneuver with the all the hydrophysical realism of CostCo shopping carts (albeit heavily armed CostCo shopping carts) pushed by a hyperactive child who has loaded up on one too many cases of family-sized No-Doz. And somehow, despite the wonky sense of proportion and the Pee-Wee Herman physics, Battlestations manages to be fun once you get fitted for the third hand with which you'll probably want to operate the controls. Each vessel type in the game has primary and defensive arms, as well as special attacks and defenses (cruise missiles for battlecruisers, flights of F-14s for aircraft carriers, etc.). And on top of that, holding down a target button toggles D-pad control between ship navigation and turret swivel (which is independent of said navigation). In terms of gameplay, this means each ship-to-ship engagement involves the simultaneous juggling of D-pad vessel control (completely independent secondary weapon targeting), and timing of special attacks and defensive measures. The good news: Each battle in the game is a one-on-one affair, which keeps the actual sea-traffic control to a manageable minimum. The bad news: If it's your patrol frigate to the other guy's aircraft carrier, that's tough luck. Actually, it can get even worse that that. In my favorite campaign game, Whale Liberator, your naval task force, must go on the hunt for whaler ships backed, bizarrely, by full-on military escorts. Deploy your forces badly enough and a whaler may slip through, engage one of your whales, and yep, you guessed it: It's you, the defenseless whale, against the inexplicably long-ranged and jaw-droppingly armed whaler ship. You get just one guess who gets whaled on. <P>It's kind of a shame that a little more time was not taken here to deepen the campaign games, or at least to offer a difficulty option for advanced players. This, like Black Dawn, is a goofy game with fast action, fun graphics, tough sound effects, a happy-go-lucky concern for play balance, and almost everything in the way of physical reality cheerfully chucked over the starboard bow. Reversing your full-sized aircraft carrier to the battle area's maximum boundary, and ramming the wimpiest patrol boat at flank speed, produces a comical bonk (and, presumably, a hearty chuckle from the PT boat's crew); lumbering battleships whirl around each other at rock-throwing range like swimming-pool ballerinas in a Buzby Berkeley film, all the while gouging each other with cruise missiles, mines, and awkward but deadly batteries of guns. If you can't get an adrenaline rush and a few good laughs from a two-player tussle under such ludicrous yet high-energy conditions, there might be something wrong with you. If you prefer to smile rather than frown when you play a game (believe me, these Preferred Frowners exist), grab a friend, a second PSX controller, and give Battlestations a try. <P>Just finish the beer and pretzels before you play. --Chris Hudak <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

How about a game that occasionally crashes in the middle of loading a level? If so, then Populous: The Beginning is the game for you. <P>Populous: The Beginning is the third game in the Populous series, and it has little, if anything, in common with the previous Populous games. Here, instead of merely playing as a god and watching from above, you're cast as a shaman, and you must directly control your followers, mostly to organize them against opposing tribes. You'll also command your tribe to build various structures, including huts where they will live, training facilities where they will learn how to fight, and guard towers, which will help you establish remotes bases of operations. If this all sounds a bit like Command & Conquer or Warcraft, that's because it plays more like those real-time strategy games than like the slower, more cerebral Populous and Populous II. <P>The game takes place on a small planet, which appears in full 3D so you can rotate your view to get a better vantage point. Unfortunately, the graphics are so blocky you can never really get a clear idea of exactly what everything is. The individual troops are so small that you frequently can't even tell exactly what type of unit you're looking at. Is that a brave or a warrior? You may never know....  <P>The game's sound is decent, but the new-agey music quickly becomes tiresome. The rest of the soundtrack is composed of the battle cries and gibberish that make up your tribe's native tongue. There is also a booming voice that speaks before every level, showing you the lay of the land and instructing you how to go about completing your objectives. <P>It's not that Populous: The Beginning is a bad game, it's just a bad PlayStation game. The controller really isn't up to the task of commanding tons of miniscule units with any amount of precision, and the graphics are so muddy you can't discern what's going on a good portion of the time.

Street Sk8Er,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Skateboarding is one of the few sports that until now hadn\'t been reproduced in game form for the PlayStation. Unfortunately, Street Sk8er is not only the first true skateboarding game for the PlayStation, it\'s also the first mediocre skateboarding game for the PlayStation.  It\'s in the gameplay that Street Sk8er really falls flat. It\'s not because the game itself controls poorly, but rather there simply isn\'t a whole lot to do. You race along, and when you come across a ramp, you can press a direction along with the jump button to execute a trick. That\'s it. You go along, jump off jumps, and land rail slides, and so long as you make it to each checkpoint before the timer reaches zero, you\'re good to go. Well I shouldn\'t say good to go, because in order to progress to the next stage you must accumulate enough points, which you get for the rail slides, tricks, and such. The only real challenge to the whole game is in knowing how many tricks to pull off in the various half-pipe-like areas within the course before pushing on. It doesn\'t matter how fast you get through the course if you don\'t rack up enough points on the way to the goal line. You\'ll simply have to redo the course.  As you proceed through the game, you unlock levels that you can later go back to and play freely in what\'s called free skate mode. The game also has a vs. mode for two players, but sadly it\'s not the two-player simultaneous split-screen mode that we\'ve seen in just about every other racing game. Instead, you and a second player alternate turns and compete for points.  Visually Street Sk8er is nothing special. The 3D polygonal boarders move and look OK, as do objects within the 3D courses, like the rails, ramps, and other obstacles. The most impressive aspect of Street Sk8er is the sound. The game has a great soundtrack featuring bands like Less than Jake, Gas Huffer, and H2O, just to name a few. But the announcer who says things like ""You\'re smoking"" when you pull off a trick is a little annoying.  In the end, unless you\'re a skateboarder who\'s been eagerly awaiting a boarding game, I\'d say pass on Street Sk8er (plus, there are two more boarding games announced for the system). I am honestly not a big skater, but I\'ve played more than enough video games to know that this game is boring. And even if you are a die-hard skater who has been waiting for a game representing the sport, I\'d highly recommend renting Street Sk8er before buying it, especially since you\'ll be able to see just about everything the game has to offer after playing it for the better part of a day.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Unfortunately, the developers must have thought they had to ditch some of the accuracy to make room for all that fun. Because in the end, Triple Play 2000 for the N64 is a watered-down version of last year\'s Triple Play for the PlayStation.  <P>Triple Play 2000 features all of the usual trimmings you\'ve come to expect from a fully licensed baseball game: real teams, real players, real stadiums, and MLB stats. You\'re given the choice of playing a season, single game, home-run challenge, or the playoffs. Rounding out the game\'s features is the ability to create and trade players. The AI in TP2K is fairly decent. However, there are a few questionable gameplay elements that make the controls a little sticky. For instance, the base runners move a little too quickly, making a standard play at first not so standard. In fact, in many instances, we found that otherwise standard fielding plays were botched due to the base-running speed of the players and the slow throwing animations of the infielders. The infielders take too much time to throw the ball when you push the button, and they don\'t throw on the run. This lag is felt in nearly all areas of the game, even when you change the speed setting. On a positive note, the batting and pitching controls are extremely precise, letting you put the ball right where you want it, after a little practice.  <P>The sound effects and music of Triple Play 2000 add a bit of quirkiness and fun to the game. Sound effects, such as an over-exaggerated crack of the bat and whoosh of the ball when you connect with a pitch, are great. The announcer is, for the most part, tolerable, though he does have one or two phrases that are a bit on the amateur side, such as the all encompassing and extremely silly, ""Play made!"" Comments from the crowd like ""You\'re in the show, show me something"" also add to the baseball atmosphere. But by far the most impressive audio element in the game is the little song excerpt that comes on when a home-team batter steps up to the plate.  <P>Visually, Triple Play 2000 is mediocre. The 3D stadiums are represented fairly accurately and the players look and move real enough, but when you put the game speed on very fast the game seems to drop more than a few frames of animation. So many, in fact, that when you swing the bat you hardly see it. The most impressive visual aspect of the game is its animation. The players run, jump, and dive realistically. The camera is pretty random. Sometimes it workswell, but in other situations it performs horribly. The camera cuts to the outfield to track the ball after it\'s hit. The only problem with this is that  the view doesn\'t always make it clear where the nearest outfielder to the ball is. <P>In comparison with the other N64 baseball games out there, like Mike Piazza\'s Strike Zone and the upcoming All-Star Baseball 2000, Triple Play 2000 falls squarely in the middle. The mediocre graphics and sluggish control leave much to be desired. I really enjoyed last year\'s Triple Play on the PlayStation but the elements that I liked about it, like the simulation feel and true baseball game atmosphere, just weren\'t there in this version. Definitely rent this one first. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

If <i>Climax Landers</i> offered battles that were actually  fun, this wouldn\'t be a problem. The battle system is as stale as humanly imaginable  and even sinks to include ancient interface issues that RPGs had supposedly long forgotten.  You can only have one of the main characters at a time in your party, which essentially  translates to having only one useful character in your party. To fill the other two  slots, you can catch monsters &agrave; la Pok&eacute;mon. When you encounter the  roaming beasties in the dungeons, the characters line up to fight. In each area  there are four spots for characters to inhabit, leaving one spot open for movement.  Each attack has a different range, meaning that the monsters may not always be able  to reach their opponents. However, not all monsters can move to another square, so  they become blocked by your other characters in a position from which they cannot  attack. This, in turn, also prevents the main character from attacking in many  situations. Additionally, when you give the command to attack, you are giving the  command to attack the location the monster is in, not the monster itself. Thus,  if the monster moves before your attack connects, your character will strike nothing  but air. This is particularly amusing when you are attacking the back row and the  monster moves forward, causing you to run right through the monster, swipe at  nothing, and then run back through it. Every weapon has multiple attack techniques  users can employ, each requiring varying amounts of vitality points per attack.  For the most part, these aren\'t balanced, and changing weapons can sometimes be  fatal to your character as a result.<P> There is almost no point in gaining experience or developing your character in  <i>Climax Landers</i>, because every time you start or finish a dungeon, your  level drops to one. So the only reason to go into dungeons is to advance the  story and get items. However, chances are you won\'t be able to use the good weapons  and armor at level one. Additionally, characters are limited to carrying four  items when entering a dungeon. Thus, the primary purpose of getting items is  to sell them. The only permanent improvements you get from completing dungeons  are spells and skills. However, many spells and skills can\'t be used until the  characters\' stats have reached a certain level. Thus, your characters essentially  start over every time they enter a dungeon. Every battle earns experience for the  characters, which in turn earns levels that raise the characters\' stats. Additionally,  upon completing a floor of the dungeon, you can allocate bonus points to your lower  stats to let the characters use spells and skills. Like in <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i>, the  difficulty of the monsters increases as the hero\'s level increases, ensuring the game  is a constant challenge and never too easy. Given the monster difficulty system that\'s  in place, it\'s not clear why the developers decided not to let you keep your experience  from dungeon to dungeon. With the current experience system, you don\'t feel like you\'re  ever getting anywhere. <P> There are plenty of interesting little side quests to do in <i>Climax Landers</i>, but  none of them make the game particularly worth playing. Having a lot of excess development  time on its hands, <i>Climax</i> programmed 10 VMU games that can be bought and collected.  A majority of the games are pretty worthless. The most interesting game is a miniature  paint program that lets you draw a picture and display it in the gallery attached to  Sword\'s house. Sword can also upgrade his monster pen and his house, both of which cost  a lot of money. You can also sign up for bounties with a leather-clad rabbit on the  Wonderland-esque island. <i>--Peter Bartholow</i>', '<BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

It's a race in some of the hottest production cars from around the world. Choose from today's high technology wonders or from yesterday's powerful American muscle cars. It's Beauty versus the Beast. Test Drive 4 takes you to international locations to race down country roads and through city streets. You'll see the picturesque town of Keswick in Englan's beautiful Lake District. You'll wind through the streets of San Francisco including the Golden Gate Bridge and Fisherman's Wharf. Blast down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Back in Europe, head for the Swiss-Italian Alps and catch a glimpse of Bern and wind your way through the majestic mountains. Wrap up your world tour in Kyoto, Japan with its startling mix of old and new."", ""When I was thirteen, my favorite game was Test Drive II for the Amiga. I don't know what made it so much fun, the variety of extensive cars to drive or the exotic locales that I got to race through at fast speeds. At the time, the concept was new, and Test Drive set the standard for other driving games to follow. I spent many weeks playing that game, and needless to say, the Test Drive series has always had a special place in my heart. Therefore, I was quite excited to pop Test Drive 4 in my PlayStation and revisit the series that I hadn't seen in so long. Sadly though, it's not as much fun as I remember it being. I've played many driving games in the past eight years, and I have liked most of them. Test Drive 4 made me realize something though, and it finally hit me: I don't have the same sense of awe when playing driving games now. Why? Because I have a driver's license and my driving experiences take place outside of the home."", ""Everything I remember about the old Test Drive game is here. Test Drive 4 features five super cars, (the Chevrolet Corvette, Dodge Viper GTS, Nissan 300ZX, Jaguar XJ 220, and TVR Cerbera), five muscle cars (the Shelby Cobra 427, '71 Plymouth Hemi Cuda, '69 Chevrolet Corvette 427, '69 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1, and '70 Cheverolet Corvette SS 454), and five tracks (San Francisco; Bern, Switzerland; Keswick, England; Washington D.C.; and Kyoto City, Japan). The game also has multiple gameplay modes, which include circuit racing, multiplayer tournaments, two-player racing (including a link mode), and a drag strip race, and all of the nuances of the Test Drive series are here, from oncoming traffic to highway patrol."", ""The graphics in Test Drive 4 look good and easily compete with the other driving games out there; the 3D animation is smooth and there is a minimum amount of pop-up. The game's seven perspectives are enough to hold you over during the gameplay, and the game also offers a replay of your past race. Hands down, this game looks good enough; it just seems to lack in other areas."", ""Test Drive 4 feels like driving your car while on medication - you know how to control the vehicle, but for some inexplicable reason you can't. It's not that the play control sucks, rather you will have trouble controlling your vehicle at high speeds, and, every once in a while, you will spin out and stop completely. This is the most annoying thing that happens during the game, and every time it does happen the action comes to a standstill. Each course is also full of twists and turns, meaning that you rarely get to reach your vehicle's maximum speed."", ""The cars in Test Drive 4 offer a good amount of variety for driving fans. Each car controls differently, but the diversity is pretty superficial. It's good that Accolade gives players a choice, but I for one don't get too excited about driving a Jaguar, let alone a Dodge Viper. I mean, come on, it's a video game - getting excited about driving a particular car in a game is about as sad as remarking that Chun-Li is hot. The five courses presented are fun though and provide a good variety of racing terrain. However, these tracks are rather short compared with some of the other racing games out there and don't contain the depth that other games do (for the best comparison, compare any track in San Francisco Rush with the San Francisco track in this game). The music is also lackluster, failing to build any sort of excitement and perhaps proving once and for all that European-sounding techno is played out."", ""With so much competition out there, it's hard for this game to rise above the rest. Most games of this type are virtually the same, and it's amazing to see the genre so crowded with look-alike titles (but then again, how much variance can driving games have?). Surprisingly, the game's most unique feature is its drag race mode, which allows you to step on the gas in a mad dash to the finish line against another gamer. That aside though, this game fails where other Test Drive games have succeeded - instead of leading, it feels like it is merely one of the pack. --Glenn Rubenstein <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

You can set it at three different positions when batting and fielding. But in not-so-key moments (like after you've thrown the ball in from the outfield or when a ball in motion is bound to go foul or over the wall), the camera changes to a dramatic angle. These angles give the game a real broadcast baseball-game look. The angles also show off the game's facial animations: You'll see Mark McGwire jump up and down after he's launched one out of the park, or the mug of the not-so-happy pitcher who served him the fat pitch."", ""When you take a look back and compare Triple Play 2000 with the previous Triple Play, there's really no question which one is better.

The single game is more appropriate for gamers not willing to set aside an entire day for the tour mode, and it lets you select one of eight variations on the classic golf game, from four ball to skins. Once you select how you actually want to play, you\'ll get to choose from one of five different PGA pro golfers, including Tiger Woods himself. If that isn\'t good enough for you, you can opt to create a golfer, but you won\'t actually be able to customize anything other than his name and what clubs he carries. Then it\'s off to one of the five actual PGA courses found in the game to battle it out. The graphics in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 are pretty horrible. While a step in the right direction from last year\'s game, they still look as out of context as ever. The digitized golfers stand out like cardboard cutouts in front of polygonal backgrounds with flat trees and one-sided shrubbery. The swing and celebration animations are well done, but they take awhile to load and get annoying after a while. The frame rate is simply terrible while the ball is moving. The background hops toward you in an extremely choppy manner while you\'re watching your ball sail toward the green. The game also features a ""read green"" button that, when pressed, moves the background in a certain direction to let you more easily read the geography of the green. This effect looks extremely bad, and it fools innocent bystanders into thinking there has suddenly been an earthquake in the middle of your golf game. Unlike last year\'s game, there isn\'t a whole lot of sound in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000. Gone are the horrible guitar riffs and rocking music - they\'ve been replaced by silence. If you make a decent shot, the crowd will applaud and murmur approvingly, expressing fascination with your ability to move the ball anywhere near the hole. Occasionally, your golfer will pipe up with some ridiculous bit of speech with phrases like, ""Sit down! Sit!"" or ""I\'ve been here before!"" But either EA only recorded Woods himself, or all the golfers in the game have amazingly similar voices, as each golfer sounds exactly like the next. Just as in last year\'s game, you\'re still better off playing Tiger Woods PGA Tour with some of your own musical selections replacing the game\'s sound. Where Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 provides a little innovation is in the game\'s creative use of the PlayStation\'s analog control. Now, instead of the tired hit-the-bar-at-the-top-and-bottom meter that has been in almost every golf game since the dawn of time, you can opt to use a handy new method. Pull back and hold the analog control to control the power of your swing, and then push it forward, left, or right to dictate the control of the swing. This new method is a lot more conducive to controlling your golf swing, and it is a nice replacement to the old method. And for players who can\'t hang with the analog control, you can disable it and opt for the good old meter. Just like last year\'s game, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 features an automatic club selection that helps players who aren\'t comfortable selecting clubs on their own. There\'s also plenty of information available to you in the various displays that overlay the actual course. It\'s a toss-up whether Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 is better than Tiger Woods PGA Tour 99. There have been some minor tweaks, but in the end 2000 still suffers from terrible graphics and laughable sound. Fairly accurate gameplay and an innovative new control scheme save Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 from being a complete loss, but it\'s in no way a game you\'ll find yourself wanting to play for prolonged amounts of time. Casual fans of the arcade-style golfing game should keep well away, and even those looking for an accurate simulation should be cautious around this one.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

With additional features like instant replay and a soundtrack by six great French rock bands, Rush Down is sure to be a hit the world over."", 'Let\'s not beat around the bush here. Rushdown is about as much fun as playing your PlayStation during a power outage. The game features three different ""extreme"" sports: mountain biking, kayaking, and snowboarding. Each section of the game is broken up into several different tracks, each of which takes place in a different part of the world. For starters, you\'ll be doing most of your racing against the clock rather than against any AI opponents. You know the drill. If you make it to the checkpoint in time, you get some additional seconds added to your clock, and you keep on trucking. Run out of time, and the race is over. In multiplayer mode, you and a friend can go at it on a split screen, either vertical or horizontal, depending on your personal preference. You can also race against a ghost racer, which mimics one of your previous attempts. Rushdown\'s control is shoddy whether you use the analog control or not. Also, you would think that with the game\'s ""extreme"" take on sports, that there would be some various tricks in the game. However, the tricks are limited to an occasional movement here and there, as long as you catch enough air and tap the jump button a couple of times. The game\'s graphics are really terrible. There\'s quite a bit of seaming between the polygons, and the game\'s got more than its fair share of pop-up. Also, the textures are so muddy and pixelated at a distance that you often can\'t tell which way the track is going to turn until it\'s too late. The sound effects are really terrible (the sound of the bike landing after a jump or fall is especially bad), and the music, billed on the packaging as an ""Original Jungle & Rock Fusion soundtrack by cutting-edge Euro bands"" is repetitive and ultimately annoying. You really have to wonder how EA could  have managed to release both this and the similarly weak Street Sk8er. There isn\'t much gameplay to be found here, and what is in the game can be mastered in around an hour. Rushdown seems as though it could have been a passable game - three years ago. Instead, it falls squarely in the ""Hey, let\'s make an extreme sports game. Heck, my kid loves to drink the Mountain Dew"" category. Avoid Rushdown at all costs.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

FIFA 99 - Nintendo 64,,['1-4 Players'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The latest installment of FIFA for the Nintendo 64 delivers a soccer sim full of depth and realism, but it isn\'t strong enough to deliver a death blow to its nemesis, Konami\'s International Superstar Soccer Pro \'98. Materially, FIFA 99 is virtually identical to the PlayStation version as far as options and features go -meaning that there\'re tons to choose from. New modes such as the golden goal, which lets teams play to a fixed number of goals, and the European dream league, which is a fantasy league built from that continent\'s best teams, offer original departures from the standard soccer game formats already in the game. Its team strategy options and custom utilities are powerful additions to the game; not only can you set up custom leagues and cup tourneys, but you can also edit team colors, uniforms, and player stats. <P>Of course, the 64-bit version of FIFA outshines the PlayStation version in the graphics department. The textures for the field and stadiums come close to photo quality, and the player shadow effects look convincingly real. There\'s never any polygon flicker or breakup during a game. The players are animated amazingly well, even though their slightly blocky, robotic appearances make them look like Popeye clones with elbows out and fists clenched. Despite these solid graphics, there are isolated instances when the game lapses into choppy animation, notably at faster gameplay speeds. It seems to stem from a slow camera, which always seems to be running behind the action onscreen. The result: slight hiccups in animation pop-up, such as a ball ""jumping"" from one player to another. It\'s not enough to hurt gameplay, but it is noticeable enough to quit playing at those superfast speeds. <P>Speaking of gameplay, the newest installment of FIFA runs like a well-oiled machine. The standard FIFA controls are a cinch to learn, while control and passing response times are on the money. Perhaps the most notable, if small, gameplay gripe is that your same-team defenders\' AI is suspect at times, as nonhuman players stick close to attackers but rarely foul or chase after loose balls. Obviously, it\'s your job to switch players and take control, but if you don\'t switch, don\'t expect the computer to back you up. <P>However, if you\'re expecting 64-bit processing to deliver some magical leap in performance over the PlayStation\'s FIFA 99, you may be in for a letdown. A few of this game\'s shortcomings can be blamed on the Nintendo 64\'s specs. Only up to four players can play simultaneously, compared with the PlayStation\'s eight. Plus, the Nintendo 64 can handle only one in-game announcer who speaks in clipped phrases, rather than the two-man banter in the PlayStation version. The otherwise decent music also takes a drop in quality because of cartridge limitations. <P>In addition, this game shares flaws also found in the 32-bit port, such as the omission of an authentic US soccer league with teams and players (due to EA Sports\' lack of an MLS license). This omission sticks out like a sore thumb when the rest of the leagues offer the real deal, although the team/player editing features can let you ""fix"" the US league if you really wanted to. The toned-down default difficulty makes it way too easy to sprint, weave, and score at will, which should force gamers to crank the difficulty up to professional to keep the gameplay balanced. <P>While FIFA 99 is the most in-depth soccer sim to date on the Nintendo 64, it still faces stiff competition in Konami\'s arcade-style International Superstar Soccer Pro \'98. Deciding which game is best for you really boils down to what floats your boat. Konami\'s game may look a bit slicker and play with more robustness - but if your definition of a great soccer game begins and ends with dead-on realism, you can\'t go wrong with FIFA 99. --Nelson Taruc <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Test Drive Off Road,,"['Platform: Sony PlayStation 1', 'ESRB Rating: KA - Kids to Adults', 'Genre: Racing']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['NO GAME - Case and manual only. Both in good shape but may have minor flaws', 'Test Drive: Off-Road is an acceptable entry in the suddenly crowded field of off-road racing games. While the actual racing can be quite fun, the game lacks the intensity that made games like Need for Speed and Wipeout XL thrilling. All the features of a great racing title are here in some form, but without edge-of-the-seat challenge, robbing the game of any long-term play value. The vehicles in Test Drive: Off-Road are based on real 4x4s: the Jeep Wrangler, the Hummer, the Land Rover Defender 90, and a Chevy K1500 Z71 Truck. Six bonus vehicles grace the title: a monster truck, dune buggy, stock car, hot rod, mini cooper, and an off-road beetle. Whether or not the realistic details matter is a point of contention, but each vehicle has slight differences in handling and acceleration that you will notice. Gladly, there are no ""suck"" vehicles in the bunch - each plays well, and once each is mastered you\'ll be able to finish first with ease. Three types of terrain make up the twelve courses in TDOR: dirt, sand, and snow. Although they all look different, you\'ll find that your truck handles roughly the same way from track to track. As you progress, the courses get more treacherous, pitting you against miles of rolling hills, jagged rocks, and even launch-pad jumps. You\'ll find your vehicle riding on two wheels, spinning out of control, or sliding on its roof more often than you\'d probably like. If there\'s one major problem with the tracks, it\'s that it\'s far too easy to lose your way, miss a checkpoint, and fall right out of contention. Oddly enough, a good strategy for winning is to hang back and follow the leader (to keep you on course), then blow past him as the finish line comes into view. (Running second for most of the race beats getting lost in the trees). Test Drive Off-Road\'s graphics are relatively strong. All the vehicles bear close resemblance to their real-life models and the textured terrain is quite detailed - even though its ""drawn"" as you progress. This ""pop-up"" dramatically reduces the game\'s speed (you won\'t feel like you\'re going as fast once you notice it). It would also be cool if the surroundings were interactive instead of stationary - for example, it would be nice if you could run down the wooden fences or trample some trees. The game\'s soundtrack, by TVT Recording Artist Gravity Kills, is booming enough to shake your speakers. (Listening to the tune ""Guilty"" while racing has been a dream of mine for some time.) Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the sound effects - the truck engines sound like vacuum cleaners. While the game seem to be appealing overall, the only real thrills are delivered the first time you play through the game. After completing the twelve courses (which takes a fairly short amount of time), you won\'t be hungry for more. Test Drive: Off-Road is a good first attempt, and hopefully Accolade will be able to improve on its basic concept and release an update next year. (Editor\'s Note: The game also features a split-screen and linkable two-player mode. It\'s roughly what you would expect - head-to-head racing with no noticeable slowdown. While not a breakthrough, its nice to see the link cable feature utilized.)<i>--Jeff Kitts</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Need for Speed: V Rally,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Need For Speed: V-Rally is the latest Electronic Arts entry into the racing world. However, don't be fooled by the title. This game has nothing in common with the previous NFS games, and wasn't even programmed by the same team. EA simply picked up the rights to V-Rally, brought it over from Europe, and slapped the NFS name on it.. <P>EA also ported over all 42 tracks and 11 cars as well, an impressive lineup compared to most racing games. This is one of V-Rally's biggest draws, because even though there are so many tracks, they don't suffer from weak layout or boring level design. Each track has its own look, and there are plenty of conditions (dirt, asphalt, snow, rain) to race in. Rally fans take note, the car lineup is a nice collection of rally cars, including the Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer, and various other name brand cars. <P>V-Rally has some of the nicest-looking graphics around, with smooth backgrounds and colorful scenery. The tracks are pleasing to the eye. The cars themselves look good as well, although not as detailed as the tracks. The sound effects are average, nothing great but at least the engine sound lacks that annoying whine that can plague racing games. The music is fairly good, composed of the typical rock-type music found in racing games, with a few tracks slightly above par. <P>The biggest draw to V-Rally is the graphics and the huge number of tracks. However, looks and tracks alone don't make a game. And this is where V-Rally falters. The control, to put it bluntly, is horrible. The cars spin out much, much too easily, and even with understeering turned all the way up in the options, the cars still tend to go wild. Granted, some cars do turn better than others (the bigger cars tend to flip uncontrollably at the slightest touch or bump), but even the best-handling cars suffer from bad control design. <P>All in all, V-Rally could have been one of the best driving games ever, but because of its shoddy control, it simply becomes a great-looking game that isn't worth playing.

Practice moves in the training mode, or find each characters motivation in the story-driven arcade mode. If your friends think they can beat you, challenge them to a match in the versus mode. Who is the greatest of all time? Play FATAL FURY: Wild Ambition and find out.', 'Due to the ease of compatibility of its hardware (the hardware\'s cartridge format made game swapping a breeze), SNK has long been entrenched as the arcade kings of bowling alleys, Laundromats, and roadside diners. SNK has made a substantial name for itself with its 2D Neo Geo games. Because these games are much cheaper to produce and distribute than their competition, and they fit into the same convenient cabinet, you could go to the most remote regions of the country and still expect to find a Samurai Shodown, King of Fighters, or Fatal Fury game hidden somewhere in the town. Conversely, you would be hard-pressed to find even the smallest minority of gamers with a Neo Geo cartridge, CD, or CDZ system in their homes, due to the cost, limited amount of games, and extremely limited supply. As a result, SNK has made a habit of porting its games to ""competing"" consoles like the Saturn and PlayStation. While the Saturn has had the benefit of the better ports, due to RAM cartridge enhancements, the PlayStation has suffered from hacked-up conversions (due to lack of RAM mainly) that could not hope to duplicate arcade quality. When SNK announced its Hyper Neo Geo 64 arcade hardware, fighting fans across the globe drooled in anticipation of all those great SNK fighting games (among others) making the leap into full 3D. Unfortunately, the first fruit of that effort, Samurai Spirits 64, was not what you would call an unmitigated success. The gameplay was slow, the graphics looked no more spectacular than your average PlayStation game, and it suffered from severe slowdown. Lost in the fray were some well-designed characters. Part 2 corrected much of these problems, but not enough to turn the world on its ear. No wonder SNK decided to keep the King of Fighters franchise in 2D for the foreseeable future. SNK\'s second attempt to transform a 2D franchise into a 3D powerhouse, however, came with the arrival of Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition. Opening the game is a good and lengthy CG-rendered introduction that reveals the origin of Terry Bogard\'s hate for the Fatal Fury boss-man, Geese Howard. After the intro fades, the joy momentarily grinds to a halt as you load up a fighting game packed to the gills with irony.  The gameplay in Wild Ambition is actually as responsive as you might expect from an SNK title. While the animation might seem choppier than its 2D counterparts, and the response times feel different, the control is actually very good. For the first time you can battle with Fatal Fury favorites Terry, Andy, Mai Shiranui, Joe  Higashi, Billy Kane and the rest of the FF crew in full 3D. Even Duck King and Mr. Karate appear as hidden characters. While the game is in 2D, primarily, Wild Ambition does make concessions to the 3D environment. Unlike Fatal Fury\'s past, the option to sidestep into the foreground and background is handled differently here. Defaulted to the triangle button is a ""shift"" command that lets your character roll into or out of the background, allowing players to dodge attacks. While nothing revolutionary, this actually can be effective and isn\'t some useless add-on like it was in Koei\'s Dynasty Warriors. In the matter of offense, there is plenty to use in the course of pummeling your opponent. The key to your success in Wild Ambition is watching your heat gauge. With each successful attack your heat gauge rises. When the gauge is full you can unleash a heat blow, which does a bit more damage than the usual attacks. If you successfully land the heat blow, your opponent will be momentarily stunned, giving you an opportunity to tack on a couple extra smacks.  You may also execute a ""super special skill"" or an overdrive attack, which are even more powerful than the heat blows. Should your heat gauge reduce to zero because of too many hits received, your character will become stunned. Also added are air recoveries and easier counterattacks. It\'s a good thing the gameplay is competent because the graphics are a huge let down. While this is the least important aspect of the game, since everything else is handled so well, it\'s a shame that the graphics and sound are so poor. While the recently released King of Fighters Dream Match 1999 for the Dreamcast features the same old 2D characters, fighting in a pseudo-3D backdrop, Fatal Fury: WA features 3D characters dishing it out against completely flat, 2D backgrounds. Large 2D bitmaps scroll independent of the grainy floor textures as if they had nothing to do with each other. In fact, the odd thing is that the 2D backgrounds are considerably less detailed than SNK\'s usual backdrops. If this is any indication of the level of quality expected in Hyper Neo Geo to PlayStation ports, perhaps SNK ought just to skip them. Wild Ambition is one of the poorest efforts in a fifth-generation PlayStation title to date. Not even remotely approaching the level of visual quality as, say, Street Fighter EX, and seeming more at the level of quality found in Fighter Maker, Wild Ambition\'s characters are blocky and pixelated. They aren\'t light sourced and they\'re prone to polygonal glitching. The ""special"" effects are also pixelated, and they make little, if any, use of the PlayStation\'s transparency effects. The high points of the game are when a character executes a special hold attack and the camera switches to a dynamic perspective, kind of like Rival Schools - but it isn\'t nearly as good. The sound is also very rough, with the announcer\'s voice sounding like he\'s reading through a phone book. Sound effects are stock quality and seem recorded in mono at a fairly low frequency, as are the character voices. The music recorded for the CG intro is quite nice and sets the mood well for the game. As far as options are concerned, there is little else beyond the arcade, versus, and practice modes. There are character profiles and stat tracking, as well as a movie viewer that lets you watch the opening movie along with all the little cutscenes peppered throughout the game. All in all, the game is still quite fun, despite the graphical letdown. While the gameplay is in place, it is rather underwhelming. You really need to be a fan of the Fatal Fury series to appreciate this game since the casual passerby would be so much better off with Tekken 3 or even Zero Divide for that matter. Let\'s hope SNK\'s Naomi-based games fare better.<i>--James Mielke</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Byzantine: The Betrayal,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games']","{'Shipping Weight:': '15.2 ounces', 'ASIN:': 'B00003IEG5', ' Date first listed on Amazon:': 'April 1, 1996'}","['I am of two minds regarding Byzantine: The Betrayal. Initially, the fuzzy photographs, lousy acting, and mediocre writing turned me off. And the game\'s gimmick - in which you must tour virtual reconstructions of historical locations - seemed a bit weak. But as I continued my way through this murder mystery with its hi-tech angle and foreign intrigue, it began to grow on me. Not enough to get an unqualified endorsement, but enough to recommend it to those looking for a challenging and informative adventure. <P>You play a journalist who travels to Istanbul to help a college buddy solve a potentially dangerous mystery. You arrive only to be met by local police who say your friend is not as innocent as you think and that by implication you are under suspicion of smuggling valuable archaeological artifacts out of Turkey. The cops let you off with an admonition to keep your nose clean and out of their business which, of course, you ignore by immediately rummaging through your friend\'s apartment. <P>Gameplay takes place in a collection of connected 360-degree photographic panoramas. You navigate using the mouse - a la Zork Nemesis - but the image quality is not up to the high standards seen in other games of the kind. Typically there are a few hot spots and inventory items in each location. Most are simple to find and apply, but there are a few truly convoluted, illogical, and marginally unfair problems in Byzantine, like a door keypad combination, an ordered arrangement of artifacts on a collection of circles, and the final escape from secret ancient underground passageways. <P>That virtual reality element is critical to the gameplay and storyline. Within the storyline, the VR program analyzes ancient objects and ""extrapolates"" information from them to create virtual versions of ancient monuments, temples, and other significant locations. It also predicts where undiscovered artifacts, believed by archaeologists to exist, can be found in unexplored areas of these ancient locations. As the story unfolds, it becomes apparent someone is using that information to unearth those objects to sell on the black market. They then erase them from the computer\'s memory so no one knows of their existence. <P>As a gameplay gimmick, you get to move through renderings of several fascinating ancient structures. As you wander you find objects which you use to solve problems and open more unexplored areas. This is where the puzzling gets problematic. For instance, it\'s clear you need to create a virtual version of an ancient hoist to lift a heavy block, but assembling the hoist parts in the proper order is darn near impossible. <P>Between your virtual journeys, you encounter many Turks played by, we\'re told in the news release, ""professional famous actors."" They may be famous in Turkey or, more likely, in their own minds but, in reality they\'re substandard. And the dialogues follow the standard interactive adventure game click-on-question-listen-to-answer process with virtually no interactivity or true branching.  <P>To complete Byzantine you\'ll need to travel to multiple locations within Istanbul and speak with several dozen characters. Knowing where to go or to whom to speak would be a problem were it not for all the built-in coincidences. Just going to locations as they open on the map usually means you\'ll encounter people critical to gameplay who are having loud conversations in English that you happen to overhear. <P>Istanbul\'s clash and blending of Muslim and Christian religions with modern and conservative cultures is fascinating, and the game captures some of that, though it could have gone a bit further to develop the atmosphere. While it suffers many problems of its genre, the story is fascinating and it holds numerous challenges - and you can\'t help but come away from Byzantine with an appreciation for Turkey\'s critical role in the growth of civilization and its unique place in modern society.<I>--Jeff Sengstack</I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Atomic Games stands by an old adage by not messing with success; <i>Battle of the Bulge</i> retains many of the interface and game-play elements of the first three <i>Close Combat</i> titles; only the scenarios and geography have changed."", 'For its latest installment, Atomic Games focuses the battles (across several dozen campaign and individual missions) and geography around the historical Battle of the Bulge. Players can command American or German troops and control a variety of military forces, including infantry, snipers, machine gunners, and flame throwers, as well as order air strikes and artillery deployment. Overall, the graphical detail of the terrain and pyrotechnics are quite good, but some players may struggle to locate the tiny military units on the murky mud terrain or bright white snow.', ""Computer-controlled artificial intelligence provides a formidable challenge during the single-player game. Along with the solo campaign, <i>Close Combat: Battle of the Bulge</i> offers both an Internet multiplayer option and a complex scenario editor for hours of additional playability. If you're a fan of the first three <i>Close Combat</i> games or searching for an in-depth military simulation, check out Atomic Games's <i>Close Combat: Battle of the Bulge</i>. --<i>Doug Radcliffe</i>"", ""Close Combat took the wargame world by storm when it was released in 1996. In addition to being one of the first wargames to pick up on the burgeoning real-time strategy craze, Close Combat was so bold as to claim to be a historically accurate simulation of war. And while Close Combat's focus on the Normandy hedgerows wasn't unprecedented, the game's style, which emphasized infantry morale, was quite out of the ordinary. It's little wonder that publisher Microsoft and developer Atomic Games reprised the title twice. Now publishing through SSI, Atomic has tried to make the magic last through yet another sequel and has succeeded once more. Close Combat: Battle of the Bulge will appeal both to Close Combat veterans and to those simply looking for a good real-time strategy game with historical overtones."", 'The fourth Close Combat centers on the battle in which Hitler threw his last reserves at the Allies in a desperate gamble to shatter the Western Alliance and bring about a separate peace. While the plan failed - it never really stood a chance - it did make for a miserable Christmas of 1944 for thousands of GIs stuck in the Ardennes Forest in Belgium and Luxembourg.', ""Close Combat is a series of squad-level World War II tactical combat games that simulate the behavior of individual men and vehicles. However, you control the games on a squad level, in that you give orders to groups rather than to their individuals. Yet the games keep meticulous track of each individual soldier's actions and capacity to fight, and it's this excellent simulation of soldiers' behavior that makes the series truly stand out. A squad that takes too many casualties will eventually go to ground and refuse to obey orders to advance and may even rout off the battlefield. Unlike a traditional real-time game, you can't just send your units off to slaughter and have them keep coming back for more."", ""At heart, the fourth Close Combat is very similar to more traditional real-time strategy games: You assign your units various orders such as move, fast move, sneak, lay smoke, ambush, defend, and fire by right-clicking the mouse, and you give your units a target or destination by left-clicking. It's that simple. The game keeps track of all your units for you, so you just manage their various formations on the battlefield rather than wallow in details like making sure a certain soldier is reloading his mortar. The game's vast breadth of units is another key feature, as all sorts of historical vehicles and unit types are present, from single snipers and machine-gun teams to heavy mortars, flamethrowing engineers, and Panther tanks. When the units clash in tactical combat, the effect is intense and never cartoonish. Close Combat: Battle of the Bulge models warfare and does a damn good job of it."", ""One of the problems with the campaigns in last year's Close Combat III was that you didn't feel like you were influencing the greater course of the war in any way by winning your battles. This was only to be expected from a historical standpoint, as the small sqauds depicted in the game could hardly hope to determine the course of Operation Barbarossa. Nevertheless, the single-player mode consequently felt like a set of strung-together scenarios rather than a more cohesive and meaningful campaign. Close Combat: Battle of the Bulge redresses its predecessor's problem by implementing a strategic map in which you can move your forces and initiate battles. German and American units can be moved around a map of the Ardennes that consists of more than 40 areas. When hostile forces coexist in an area, combat occurs. Because the strategic map is used to determine supply, positional objectives become very important. This new strategic element is well designed and has a great effect on gameplay."", ""The strategic overview and the tense nature of the Bulge campaign make the fourth Close Combat a pulse-pounding game that forces you to do more than just fight the next battle. But the real appeal of the game is the tactical combat itself. Panthers race up forested roads to engage American armor, bazooka teams lie in wait in snowy Belgian hamlets, and even air and artillery strikes are available to the commander trying to force that crucial breakthrough, or prevent it. The fact that every battle actually has relevance to the overall strategic situation makes the game far more interesting than it would have been as a typical World War II battle simulation. Like any successful sequel, Close Combat: Battle of the Bulge doesn't merely rehash the features of its predecessor, but adds to them."", ""However, Battle of the Bulge doesn't escape some of the problems that cropped up in previous games in the series. The most notable of its problems is the computer opponent's artificial intelligence, which can be downright abysmal when it's playing as the Germans, especially in regard to the pathfinding of armored units. In fact, the pathfinding can be so bad that it's pretty much pointless for you to play as the Allies in any scenario that requires the Germans to attack first; the computer is simply incompetent on the attack. Fortunately, the computer is much more capable on the defensive."", ""Close Combat III: The Russian Front also had a tendency to become too focused on armor. Infantry units seemed unusually weak, which encouraged you to bolster your forces with tanks whenever possible. Battle of the Bulge avoids this problem by beefing up the staying power of infantry, as well as by eliminating its predecessor's unit-purchase system altogether. Instead of using experience points to buy new units, you are given replacement pools from which to choose units, and additional tanks won't be available if a given formation already has its full complement. The replacement pools make the game correspond more closely to the actual campaign, and they are a solution to the Close Combat III pitfall that eventually led to all-armor formations as the game progressed, although the preset replacements hamper the multiplayer mode, since you can't really customize your forces."", 'Battle of the Bulge also has a few strange order-of-battle problems, such as ubiquitous flamethrower- and rocket-halftracks, which were never so abundant in reality. Despite its general historical accuracy, the Close Combat series has always played a little loose with vehicle and ordnance details. However, the occasional historical inconsistency never really detracts from the games: Just like its predecessors, Close Combat: Battle of the Bulge is ultimately very enjoyable to play.', ""In fact, it's so fun that Close Combat: Battle of the Bulge will prove to be one of those games that you'll fire up again and again, and each time you'll come away having enjoyed yourself tremendously. The new strategic element gives the fourth Close Combat a whole new dimension that more than makes up for the weak artificial intelligence and reduced multiplayer options. Some historical warfare simulations are long on history and short on fun. Close Combat: Battle of the Bulge has a dash of the former and a huge dose of the latter. -- <i>Bruce Geryk</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Also, these players don\'t wrap-tackle like most tackles in the NFL. Instead, they bounce off of each other during tackles like the old 2D games. The polygonal graphics should have liberated Madden 64 of this annoyance, but I suspect the short development time hindered the game in this aspect. Despite any of these shortcomings, Madden 64 is by far the most realistic football title on the Nintendo 64. It uses the same gameplay and AI from the 32-bit versions of the game, which were also impressive in this aspect. Although EA may annoyingly call this Liquid AI, it really does have something to brag about. I\'ve been a football fan for a long, long time, and I\'ve never seen anything that resembles the NFL more than this game (and that\'s amusing, since this game doesn\'t even have an NFL license). Defense players cover receivers like they should, thus eliminating the ""money plays"" that plague every football game (in comparison, Quarterback Club 98 has a ton of them). If you know how to read a defense, you should have no trouble on offense, but if you don\'t, there\'s a rookie mode that should ease your transition into this great football simulation. The only major flaw in this otherwise stellar AI is that the computer offense is a little incompetent at times, partly because it rarely runs the ball. Along with great gameplay is a deep host of options that make Madden 64 a complete football game. The Fantasy Draft option that lets you hold a complete player draft to create your own teams from the ground up is a great option that is usually only found in PC pigskin games. Other team-building features such as the trading, creating, releasing, and signing of players is available, and they can be refereed under the salary cap and trading deadline. Although it has a few flaws, Madden 64 is still the best football simulation on the Nintendo 64. Ironically, the most realistic NFL simulation on the market lacks an NFL license, held exclusively by Quarterback Club 98. Still, I urge football fans to buy this title, unless having the real NFL teams and logos (this game does have the real NFLPA players) is of supreme importance to them.<i>--Darren Lehrmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

Heart of Darkness - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""There was a period in time when the side-scrolling action-adventure was a dominant computer game genre. Computer side-scrollers were differentiated from their console counterparts by relying more upon puzzle solving than button pushing, with two games - Out of this World and Flashback - being prime examples of the genre (a complete list would also have to include the Prince of Persia games, the Dark Castle games, and even early efforts like Karateka, Conan, and Bruce Lee). The genre returns to its roots with Amazing Studios' Heart of Darkness, a simple and frustrating little chunk of a side scroller."", ""The only recent game to which Heart of Darkness can be compared is Abe's Oddysee, but even that comparison comes up a little short. Abe's was pure puzzle solving; Heart of Darkness is a mixture of action-oriented puzzles and puzzle-oriented action. As such, it can really only be compared to Flashback and Out of this World, a not-so-surprising fact considering that Amazing Studios is made up of numerous people who worked on both of those games. Like its predecessors, Heart of Darkness is made up of a series of static screens. In each screen there is a small puzzle, or piece of a larger puzzle that will encompass several screens. The puzzle can be as simple as jumping over a crawling beast or as complex as figuring out how to activate some mechanism that will open a door several screens away while keeping an ever-increasing number of enemies at bay."", ""As I said, it's frustrating. Many will find it far too frustrating, but Out of this World and Flashback (both generally acknowledged as great games) were equally as hard. Heart of Darkness will test your reflexive ability, your timing, and your eye-hand coordination. But more than anything, it will test your patience. You'll repeat segments over and over and over again until perfecting them, and then you'll die on the next segment and have to do them over."", ""What's most impressive about Heart of Darkness is its environment. Story-wise, it's not much different from one of those movies about kids and their associated monsters that became a dime a dozen in the wake of ET. You play Andy, a little boy who has lost his dog during an eclipse. More directly, the dog was lost to the eclipse, snatched away to some nether realm of darkness and shadow. Andy, though, has a hat made out of a colander and some lights, a toy gun that shoots lightning, and, best of all, an airplane - so everything should work out fine."", ""OK, so the story isn't that great. But once Andy gets to the nether realm, the art and enemy design is fantastic. The enemies are mostly shadowy, simian-like creatures, which are entirely black except for their glowing green eyes. Other enemies aren't just shadowy, but actual shadows - and you'll have to knock out the object creating them to get past. It creates a truly hostile, frightening world, and more importantly, the designers are able to reuse the same enemies in many different ways to keep the progression challenging."", ""The graphics themselves are almost the game's best point. At a higher resolution, they would be beautiful - the incredibly lifelike animations and detailed backdrops are pretty marvelous. Unfortunately, the low resolution keeps things a little blocky, which puts a damper on the obvious care put into the art. Said low resolution is the only clue that the game has been in development as long as it has (anywhere from five to seven years according to various sources); the game itself is quite short. The sound is always appropriate, and the music, sparse as it may be, is a dramatic score performed by the London Philharmonic Symphony."", ""Apart from the difficulty, there was only one other frustrating factor to Heart of Darkness: the end. It simply didn't feel like an ending. The game (or at least the story) sort of just stops. Sure, there's a big cinematic at the conclusion (and it's important to note that the cinematics are quite impressive), but it doesn't feel like a satisfying conclusion. There is, however, a great little surprise after the credits if you manage to sit through them."", ""Heart of Darkness isn't a bad game. It's a bit short and a bit frustrating, but it's always moderately fun and occasionally very fun. Those who played Out of this World and Flashback will probably be more forgiving of its shortcomings and will undoubtedly feel some sense of nostalgia as they work their way through Heart of Darkness. Others will probably see a game that could have been incredible had it come out four or five years ago but now is just a somewhat nice-looking fairy tale with a vague story and the strange effect of causing people to tear their hair out, clump by clump.<i>--Ron Dulin</i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Nine playable tables (all can be played in Windows or DOS) are included with the game, so you can try a few rounds to get your creative juices flowing before you get to the heart of the program: the Workshop."", 'You\'ve got two choices when creating your own table: build one essentially from scratch, or modify one of the tables that comes with the game. I say ""essentially from scratch"" because there are certain design parameters you don\'t have any control over - flippers, ramps, and side-guards are already in place. Fortunately, there are 32 table templates to choose from, so finding one that suits your tastes shouldn\'t be a problem.', ""Don't care for the background graphics on a table? No problem - import a PCX or BMP image of your choosing to replace it. Adding a new object or modifying the appearance of an existing one is simple thanks to the game's Graphics Editor, which lets you crop an existing graphic in the shape of kickers, bumpers, lamps, and other objects and add it to the program's already extensive object library. And once an object's been placed on the table you can change its properties (what happens when you hit it), from number of points, awards, and sound effects, to mirroring and rotating a graphic."", ""In short, Pinball Builder gives you a lot of tools to work with, and once you fully grasp the mechanics of the interface you'll appreciate just how broad in scope the options are here. But the program does have a few quirks. For one, I'm a little puzzled why you cant place ramps, though to be fair it might be a little tough dealing with an object that's three-dimensional. But I can't figure out why flippers aren't one of the objects you can place on the table, or why the program wasn't designed to allow you to modify existing sound effects (or add new ones)."", ""Another problem I encountered was ball speed. With an ATI Mach 64 Pro Turbo PCI video card, the ball moved at the speed of sound whether I was playing in DOS or Windows, while on an S3 video card it ran fine in Windows and at 320x200 in DOS but accelerated to unplayable speeds as I increased the DOS resolution. (21st Century Entertainment's Technical Support team is aware of the ATI Mach 64 problem and is currently working on a patch.)"", ""Those gripes are relatively minor, however, compared to what Pinball Builder has to offer. Even if you never create a table, you can still enjoy new challenges by loading tables created by other, more industrious owners of Pinball Builder. But a word of warning: Things can get a little sluggish if your system only meets the game's minimum system requirements. Your best bet is to download the demo and see how well it runs on your machine before spending any money - that's what demos are for, right?<i>--Stephen Poole</i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Disc(s) are professoinally cleaned. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', 'It\'s very difficult to make a new, exciting puzzle game these days. The most addictive games are usually variants of the ""blocks dropping into a well"" theme. Wetrix+, at its core, has a lot of block-dropping going on, but the game hides it well enough to make it feel totally different. However, there\'s one fatal flaw that really keeps the game from reaching that Tetris-like plateau. You start the game with a flat 3D surface, and then the blocks begin to fall. The object is to build large, enclosed areas because after several large blocks fall, water will begin to drop onto your playfield. You want as little water to fall off your platform as possible, so you\'ll have to build a collection of lakes to store the water. Fireballs will allow you to dry up a lake, and bombs will blow a large hole in your playfield, which you\'ll have to repair quickly to keep the water from draining. Later, ice cubes will cause your lakes to freeze. This all sounds fine and good, and the game is indeed fun, but there\'s one more facet of the game, which manages to really mess things up. That something is the earthquake meter. As you build your walls higher and higher to store more water, this earthquake meter builds. If your walls get too high, the earthquake hits, destroying your carefully built reservoir and, unless you\'re quick and lucky, ending your game. While the need for something to balance the game is obvious (otherwise you could just build up huge walls around the edges of your playfield and play the game forever), the earthquake simply isn\'t it. The graphics get the job done, and the water effects are really pretty. The soundtrack is filled with peppy techno numbers that fit the action pretty well, and the electronic voice that reports information like how many lakes you currently have is cool. There are a few different camera angles, but none of them are particularly more or less useful than the default view. If it weren\'t for that silly earthquake thing, Wetrix+ could have been a great puzzle game. It has different modes, including multiplayer options, and all the bells and whistles you could ever want in a puzzle game. But the earthquake really prevents the game from reaching its full potential. Still, considering the Dreamcast\'s lack of domestic puzzle games, Wetrix+ fills a gap, and puzzle fans should at least check it out.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Big racing chairs for you and your opponent to sit in, big screen monitors to see all the arcade action with, and big sturdy force-feedback steering wheels and pedals to feel every bump and grind with. In its eagerness to port it to the PC, Sega didn't get any of this in the original. No multiplayer, no force feedback, and only three tracks. But now the deluxe version addresses most of those problems."", ""You have your choice of eight different stock cars, each with slightly different features such as acceleration or grip, as well as the option of tuning a particular car by adjusting things like suspension or handling. But before you get too excited thinking it's just like NASCAR Racing, you best put the brakes on. At best it could be described as NASCAR Racing lite, really lite."", 'You get to burn some rubber on the six hi-res courses, that is if your PC\'s got the horsepower under its hood (you\'re gonna need at least a Pentium 90 for a decent frame rate). Though in classic ""what were they thinking"" fashion, there\'s no support for 3D cards, making the best resolution here a bit ho-hum compared to almost any other similar product. To be fair, the company is using the tried-and-true ""a patch is forthcoming"" in the nebulous future.', ""Thankfully, it does include the multiplayer support that accounted for most of the original's appeal. You can play up to eight over a network or through your other standard multiplayer options. And if you want to race with a buddy sitting close by, there's a two-player split-screen mode. Though this is nice, it fails to capture that same arcade experience. So too with the controller; as there aren't any force-feedback steering wheels yet, you're going to have to be content with a force-feedback joystick if you want the feel of every turn and crash."", ""But let me restate the fact that this isn't a bad game, per se. It's just that if you have 50 bucks to buy a racing game, NASCAR Racing 2's arcade mode offers more fun, options, and better graphics than Daytona. If, however, you're a die-hard arcade racing fan who owns them all (and perhaps are independently wealthy with nothing better to spend your money on), keep in mind that this game may never make it to the winner's circle, but it'll get you where you want to go.<i>--Shane Mooney</i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Play solo against <i>Triple Play 2001</i>'s enhanced artificial intelligence  (AI) or go head-to-head against your buddies.

The umpire even argues and gives high fives. Great plays are  rewarded with unlocked extras and cheats, including special players and  power-ups. <i>Triple Play 2001</I> features an exclusive 500 Home Run Club license."", ""Inasmuch as baseball is regarded as America's past time, the Triple Play series is lauded as the series to beat when it comes to PlayStation baseball games. The initial releases, though plagued with frame-rate problems, were the first to offer a decent ballpark experience. With last year's release, EA fixed the frame-rate issues and delivered what was considered by many to be the best PlayStation baseball game ever. This year, EA Sports is seeking similar kudos with its release of Triple Play 2001, a game that once again seeks to evolve rather than innovate. Similar to prior releases, Triple Play 2001's gameplay sticks to familiar roots. You can control batting angle, height, and even the power of your swing. Further, controlling stance position, a dodgy experience in prior releases, is now a valuable game strategy. Should you swing for right field or pull the ball to left? Push L1 or R1, and your player will shimmy his high-paid bottom into whatever position you desire. Past the crack of the bat, base running is identical to that in previous Triple Play titles. Press a direction button to run to a base, or press triangle and a direction button to return. Depending on the button pressed, you can also charge, slide, or induce a collision at the plate. Once in a while, base-running commands aren't accepted as fast as one would like, but such occurrences are uncommon.  As with the offensive side of things, Triple Play 2001's pitching and fielding are both just as simple to learn and difficult to master. You have the choice of four stock pitches, usually a curve ball, fastball, slider, or change-up. After selecting the pitch, you can then alter both the throwing angle and pitch speed. Pay attention to your stamina meter though, or you'll end up throwing potatoes by the fourth inning. Backing you up, the fielders under your control run like banshees and, depending on your timing, you can make the fielders either jump or dive after a ball and send it flying toward a teammate. Combine all of the above with variable difficulty levels, and Triple Play 2001's gameplay is nothing but solid. It's not the gameplay that's going to bring controversy to Triple Play 2001 though but rather the additional features that come packaged with it. The game has all the exhibition, versus, home-run derby, and player draft/creation modes that hardball lovers have come to expect. In addition, the ability to unlock such legendary players as Babe Ruth or Ted Williams is a nice treat. However, while these features imbue the game with a decent level of respect, it's the addition of cheat code and enhancement rewards that's going to have Triple Play fans up in arms. Every few innings or so, you will unlock rewards such as big heads, tall players, big baseballs, or big bats. For those who dig an arcade-like experience or want NBA Jam-style baseball, these rewards may not be problematic. However, those used to purer baseball experiences may find these rewards distracting. Thankfully, EA made the use of these rewards entirely up to the user, but their presence itself does take some getting used to. While the game's play mechanics and features benefit from minor tweaking, Triple Play 2001's visuals remain on par with last year's release. Player graphics deliver near-perfect caricatures of their real-world counterparts, while all 30 stadiums are rendered in splendid detail, replete with field signage and various other trademark accoutrements. Some texture warping is present, and minor clipping issues abound, but these issues aren't as prevalent as they were last year. In fact, if there's any real complaint to be made, it's that TP2001 just delivers more of the same visually. EA deserves credit for not ruining the audio quality of the Triple Play series. Hitting, fielding, sliding, and player-interaction effects are both dramatic and entertaining, sounding peppy and energetic without being unrealistic. Furthermore, Buck Martinez and Jim Huson's play-by-play is quirky, varied, and full of the lingo baseball fans have come to expect from quality color commentary. Admittedly, the play-by-play is repetitive at times, but it's nowhere near as painful as what High Heat 2001 delivers. Rounding out Triple Play 2001's aural assault, spectator, stadium, and vendor sound bites further add to the game's level of quality and realism. In total, Triple Play 2001 is a game that represents the cream of PlayStation baseball titles. It's not perfect, but it succeeds at what it does and delivers the best rendition of a baseball experience of any PS baseball title. It's fun, amply realistic, and the variable simulation levels open the game up to wider audiences. Though hard-core fans may scoff at the addition of rewards and cheats, the option to play without them makes Triple Play 2001 an update that both simulation fans and arcade lovers can embrace.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Alundra 2: A New Legend Begins,,['ALUNDRA 2 A NEW LEGEND BEGINS'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['An epic struggle between good and evil ignites the kingdom of  Varuna as the peaceful realm falls under the control of a sinister  baron. You are Flint, a renegade swordsman seeking revenge on the  pirates who killed your mother and now flourish under the new  regime.', 'You must wield your sword through this land of unsuspecting danger and  adventure. Can you successfully explore and survive this intricate  story wrought with bizarre characters, brain-twisting puzzles, and wild  games? Beware! An even greater evil is about to be revealed.', 'Few games reek of the grasping, guileless profiteering that goes on in the game industry as much as Alundra 2 does - it\'s a sad, uninspired attempt to turn a mildly popular game into a mildly popular franchise. Lifeless exercises like this game are cooked up when companies are concerned merely with name recognition and branding, and quality comes in a distant second to marketing. While it\'s definitely playable, it\'s mediocre in almost every way and begs the question - why would you even consider it, with the plethora of titles on the platform? In this new adventure you\'ll be playing as Flint, the typical disproportionate, red-haired, cute-faced anime hero of whimsical RPGs. Pirates have killed his parents, you see, and there\'s a price on his head. You\'ll meet up with a dashing princess, the weasely pirates, and the oddly green and malevolent Mephisto, a sorcerer bent on world domination via the bizarre method of inserting clockwork keys into people and animals, turning them into android killing machines and slaves. Alundra 2 dispenses with any and all ties to the original game. This time around, Contrail - creator of the Wild Arms series and Legend of Legaia - has the chief creative duties on this game. Of course, the term ""creative"" is used very loosely here - because Alundra 2 isn\'t particularly original. Basically, we have a by-the-book experience, the endless banality unsuccessfully obscured by inane minigames. Gone too is the title character, Alundra, and any graphical, artistic, or thematic references to the original game.  The gameplay, too, is absolutely nothing original or inventive. The game employs endless standard action-RPG methodology - you have a sword, and you must smack things with it. Of course, magic is on the horizon as well. The control implementation is not the best either, and Flint will overshoot his targets in a desperate leap and get smacked upside the head in the worst scenario. Of course, getting smacked upside the head is more common than ever in Alundra 2, because Activision\'s almost flawless localization is marred by the increased ""normal"" difficulty level. The enemies do otherworldly damage in this mode. Thankfully, they have left ""easy"" - the original difficulty level in the Japanese version. Alundra 2 dispenses with its prequel\'s 2D graphics, which while basic, were functional. Instead we\'ve got hapless pointy, jagged, and seamy polygons flickering and clipping their way through a universe of warped and pixelated textures. This game would\'ve been graphically mediocre in 1997 - but for the occasional decent texture map. Soundwise, Alundra 2 is much more reasonable - while the music is fairly derivative of the work of such mainstay fantasy composers as Final Fantasy\'s Nobuo Uematsu, it\'s handled with complete competence and serves as a desperate, valiant background to the floundering mechanics and jagged graphics.  The character voices are lively, and the text is grammatical, occasionally amusing, and pretty natural - Activision\'s localization team has done a great job. It\'s a shame that this effort was wasted on such a mediocre title. Hopefully, the company\'s marketing department will see beyond branding next time and acquire a more interesting game. Alundra 2 suffers most from the fact that there is no real reason for it to exist. Fans of the original adventure will surely be disappointed with this one: Being suckered into buying a game that\'s a purported sequel and then receiving a product that bears no resemblance to the original is a frustrating experience. This game sold extremely poorly in Japan, so the prospects of a true Alundra sequel are dim at best, unless it\'s a smashing success in the USA. While it\'s true that almost all games are created as profit machines, some transcend - Alundra 2 is an unkind reminder that pulls us back into the base clay.<i>--Christian Nutt</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Street Sk8Ter 2 PS,,"['street sk8er', 'playstation', 'skateboarding']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""With shopkeepers, pedestrians, and The Man hassling you, what's a skater to do? You need to find a place to put in the bruising, bone-braking hours needed to hone your skills. With <I>Street Sk8er 2</I>, you simply turn an abandoned warehouse into your own personal skate park. Use the natural obstacles such as pipes and rails as departure points for your tricks and combos (over 200 to put in your repertoire). Once you've got the space as you like it, slap it on a separately sold memory card, truck it over to your friend's PlayStation, and see how your friend does."", ""Once you've got the moves down, take them to the crowd in the three-level Street Tour World Championship. Race against the clock while collecting special trick points in 11 events that include street, halfpipe, and park courses. Don't worry if you have trouble hanging with the big boys--<I>Street Sk8er 2</I> has a variety of skill levels and a free-skate mode that lets you indolently explore the game's many courses."", 'About a year ago, Electronic Arts released the first skateboarding game to come along in a long time. It was one of the lamest PlayStation games to come out that year, but it must have sold well enough for other companies to sit up and take notice. Now we\'ve seen games like Thrasher: Skate and Destroy and Tony Hawk\'s Pro Skater, two good skateboarding games that show that the genre definitely has a lot to offer. Now, EA is getting back into the game with a sequel, Street Sk8er 2. The game takes a lot of its influences from games like Tony Hawk, and as a result it isn\'t a failure, as its predecessor was. Much of the game is essentially a race against time. You need to get from point A to point B in X number of seconds, occasionally hitting some checkpoints that add time to your clock. The catch is that you must finish the course under a certain time while earning a certain number of points. So you must strike a balance between speed and tricks to ensure that you reach the finish line with enough points to proceed to the next level. The level design is pretty nice, containing lots of ramps and various things you can ollie over, grind on, and, if you\'re not careful, smack your face against. The levels also feature multiple paths and shortcuts, as well as windows, barrels, and other breakable objects. You can pick from a few different skaters, each of whom has a different set of tricks. But executing high-scoring trick combos isn\'t exactly difficult, as your skater sort of ""homes in"" on the lip of the ramp you\'ve jumped from, making it a challenge to actually wreck when skating in pipes. The secret to tricks is to simply hold down L1 or R1 as you\'re going airborne from the edge of the pipe - this causes you to spin. Then, you simply jam on as many different directions and buttons as possible and let go of the L1 or R1 button before you land. The game automatically straightens you out, making it almost too easy. If you can\'t even handle this, there\'s an auto-trick mode that makes things even easier. Aside from the main competition mode, there\'s also a free-skate mode, which lets you simply skate around the areas you\'ve previously visited in the main mode. You can also create your own skate park out of prefabricated parts, including ramps, pipes, and rails. The game also has a multiplayer pool duel, supporting both a split-screen mode and link cable (!) support. Graphically, Street Sk8er 2 looks significantly better than the original game, but not nearly as fluid or as sharp as Tony Hawk. The moves don\'t transition particularly well into one another, making big trick combos look extremely jerky. The levels are extremely large and look pretty good. The soundtrack is filled with songs from artists like Del the Funky Homosapien, Shootyz Groove, and Ministry. The game\'s sound effects are also quite nice and fairly realistic. Street Sk8er 2 is one of those games that would have been much better received if another, better game didn\'t exist. In this case, that game is Tony Hawk\'s Pro Skater. Still, Street Sk8er 2 is a huge improvement over the original, and skaters looking for something to do while waiting for Tony Hawk 2 to ship would do well to check out EA\'s second offering.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Trick off everything (including cop cars) in nine real-world locales, including Burnside Skatepark, malls, a school, and a downtown--all with secret areas, shortcuts, ramps, and interactive objects.', ""When it comes to Game Boy skateboarding titles, the selection is sorely lacking. Other than 720 and Skate or Die, no game has managed to approach the proper boarding experience. However, thanks to the popularity of the Tony Hawk series, Natsume and Activision have brought us their attempt at handheld skateboarding action with their GBC rendition of Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Though there's much to like and dislike about the title, one thing's for certain - skateboarding has never been this good on a handheld. Whether because of hardware constraints or rushed licensing, the game actually contains two unrelated activities - half pipe and tournament. In half pipe, players can take one of 14 real-world board champs through a high-flying journey of ollies, heelflips, Indy Nosebones, and various other catchphrased tricks. The half-pipe backdrops are well drawn and colorful, while the animation level is such that you never feel out of control. Furthermore, trick execution is confined to four-way directional-pad presses coupled with either the A or B button, making the game easy to grasp while letting board freaks chain together insane combos. Though the half-pipe mode doesn't deliver an experience at all like that of the console version of Tony Hawk, the ease of control coupled with rewarding gameplay nevertheless makes it a mode worthy of kudos. Better resembling the console experience is Tony Hawk Pro Skater's second game type, the tournament mode. You'll compete against three other boarders in a mad dash for the finish line. You attempt to come in first while executing tricks off such objects as fences, cars, ramps, and other course obstacles. The courses aren't as varied or unique as in console levels, but the animation level is high, and one never gets the impression that the game is sparsely drawn. Just as with the half pipe, tournament-mode controls are limited, but they let advanced gamers chain together some spectacular combos. Initially, tournament levels seem overly difficult, but a few minutes at the controls and you'll be grabbing speed bonuses, collecting VCR tapes, and somersaulting with the best of them. It would be nice if the computer couldn't just run you down, however, especially since returning the favor is near impossible. A one-on-one tournament is also available, but since the game lacks two-player capability, the one-on-one mode is merely for practice against the computer. While Tony Hawk's music and sound effects are borderline mediocre, they truly are some of the best executed on the GBC. Be it wooshing sounds for flips, thud sounds for landing, or the game's amusing crash effects, a variety of auditory nuances do an adequate job of portraying the boarding experience. Though an even greater level of variety would have been nice, what's present is quite appropriate. If anything, it's not the graphics or sound that detract from the game's overall quality, but the lack of a two-player feature. Since there are only eight combined tournament and half-pipe levels, the game's replay value is questionable at best. For some, the half-pipe mode will do a lot to counteract this complaint, but for most, the possibility of forgetting the game within a week is all too real. Tony Hawk also lacks a battery backup, but the passwords aren't overly long, and you needn't jot one down for every level. Though there's much room for improvement, Tony Hawk Pro Skater is easily the best skateboarding game available for the Game Boy Color. The visuals are pleasing, the sounds are appropriate, and there's just enough replay value to warrant a cautious purchase. For those into tricks, the half-pipe mode alone is worth the price of admission, but one can't rule out the sheer challenge that the tournament mode offers either. Natsume hasn't delivered a port of the PlayStation, N64, or Dreamcast Tony Hawk games by any stretch, but the GBC effort is pretty fun and does ample justice to the Tony Hawk name. <I>--Frank Provo </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

NHL Rock the Rink,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Boston Bruins tough guy Marty McSorley was once charged with assault  with a weapon after knocking Vancouver Canuck Donald Brashear out cold with a  two-handed stick swing to the right temple. What's the guy's problem, you ask?  He's playing the wrong game. Only <i>NHL Rock the Rink</i> lets players get away  with moves like that: body slam your opponent to the ice, feed him a fistful of  leather, drop him like a rock with a wicked clothesline, or check him out of his  skates. Best of all, none of these moves will land you in the penalty box."", ""<i>NHL Rock the Rink</i> delivers hockey like you've never experienced before.

Fast- paced action is guaranteed with a shot clock and team momentum meter. Take the  ice against your friend for intense head-to-head action, or see if you can  survive a championship challenge season, earning rewards to build your team into  a powerhouse. <i>NHL Rock the Rink</i> is knockdown, drag-out, no-holds-barred  hockey. Get on the ice and get it on!"", 'When it comes to sports games, there are two types of people in the world. Some people get it, and some people don\'t. Some people want a grandiose simulation-based experience, while others want to randomly tap buttons and watch the magic. The first group, those who want realistic sports games, may have a hard time warming up to EA\'s fast-paced, no-rules ice hockey game, NHL Rock the Rink. But the game delivers a solid, exciting brand of gameplay that harkens back to a simpler time, when EA was making incredible Sega Genesis hockey games that were light on sim and hard on checks. The game serves as the spiritual successor to EA\'s Mutant League Hockey, and it demands attention from anyone even remotely interested in the ""sports lite"" genre. Let\'s start with the rules. Rock the Rink removes two players from each team, making it a four-on-four game, if you include the goalies. There\'s no time clock. Instead, you play to a certain score, which defaults to five. The game also institutes a basketball-like shot clock, which forces you to constantly work your way up the ice. If the clock expires, your player falls over, and the puck gets loose. There are no rules like icing or offsides - the only times play stops is when the puck flies out of play, a fight breaks out, or a goal is scored. So, since penalties are a thing of the past, you can fly around the rink, checking as hard as you possibly can. There are even special checks and shots, like body slams and tornado shots, as well as check-dodging special moves, such as the air deke. Like Nintendo\'s classic NES game, Ice Hockey, the players in Rock the Rink are broken down into two groups - small guys and big guys. The small players (termed finesse players in the game) are better shooters, and they can execute special shots. Of course, being smaller players makes them easy to crush, and they can\'t fight too well either. The big (power) players check much harder, and they can take a little more of a beating before giving up the puck. But they can\'t maneuver on the ice as nimbly as the small guys. The game starts you off with a collection of make-believe teams, such as the Cabbies and the Sting. As you progress through the game\'s NHL challenge mode, you\'ll unlock NHL teams, complete with actual players. The NHL challenge is also the portion of the game that lets you earn upgrades for your teams. You\'ll earn three levels of upgrades for your speed, power, and shooting. Other game modes include a jump-right-in arcade mode and a tournament mode that lets you crown the King of the Rink. The game has an extensive collection of unlockable options, including different pucks, rinks, and, of course, big-head mode. The gameplay is really something. The game runs at a blazing speed, but the analog control is tight enough to let you weave between players and make your way to the net with ease, once you\'ve spent some time with the game. The control is easy to pick up, and the games are usually short enough to make it an excellent group experience. The only real black mark on the gameplay is a minor one. The fighting is absolutely lame. While you really can\'t expect a fighting engine worthy of a Tekken or a Street Fighter, the fighting in Rock the Rink consists of four buttons, three different hits, and one block. You and your opponent simply time button presses in hopes of squeezing a hit between blocks. Very boring. Luckily, the game practically asks you if you want to fight (a bell rings and you must hit R2 to actually enter the fight), so you can skip out on the lame fighting 90 percent of the time. Graphically, Rock the Rink looks pretty sharp. The characters aren\'t the most detailed player models in the world, but the game\'s frenetic pace more than makes up for the title\'s simple look. The models animate pretty well, especially the goalie, who executes stick and glove saves extremely well. The game\'s soundtrack is made up of a bunch of songs about hockey, but the music only plays when one team is in bonus mode, which pumps up the stats of your entire team for a few seconds. Celebrity Skin by the band Hole plays over the game\'s prerendered intro movie. The commentary takes on the ESPN style of sports announcing, full of catch phrases and witty pop-culture references. Since the game runs so quickly, the announcer is always talking, calling out big hits, passes, and shots. The announcer remains interesting for about a week, then the repetition starts to become a bit of an issue. NHL Rock the Rink is a pleasantly surprising ""extreme"" sports game. It doesn\'t get muddled down with too much stat tracking or too many gameplay options. It\'s a basic, bare-bones game that lets you jump right in and score some goals. Hockey fans may find that the game strays a bit too far from their favorite sport, but the game is amazingly exciting and makes a worthwhile purchase for anyone looking for a fast-paced competitive game.  <I>--Jeff Gerstmann </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

The phrase conjures up several images: sleek submarines slipping beneath the waves; torpedoes knifing through the water at unsuspecting targets; men silently praying that the next depth charge doesn't find them. SSI manages to capture all of these elements in Silent Hunter, their new World War II submarine simulator. <P>One item that immediately stands out is the variety of options available to the player. Do you want to play a campaign or single mission? Do you want dud torpedoes enabled or disabled? Do you want your crew to be green, veteran, or elite? Silent Hunter gives you a Realism Panel to select the options that fit your abilities or desires. You can make things as simple or difficult as you like. <P>Once you've selected a mission, the game places you in the control roomthe nerve center of the submarine. From here, you can use the mouse to jump from station to station. SSI cleverly lets you access common controls (navigation, torpedoes) from several different stations to prevent unnecessary navigation; when you do need to check out another station, you can use keyboard shortcuts to jump around the ship quickly. I recommend sticking to easy missions when starting out so you can get comfortable with the control interface. <P>A trip to the bridge or a look through the periscope, reveals some of the finest graphics I've ever seen in a submarine simulator. The sun rises and sets, the moon goes through phases, and cloud cover reduces visibility. Coastal cities even show distinct buildings, lights, and docks. Enemy ships are rendered in great detail, but do pixellate even in a close-up view. Sinking ships burn and smoke realistically. <P>Although Silent Hunter's graphics are excellent, its sound is even better. Sonar pings from enemy ships vary based upon distance and depth. Depth charges can rattle your teeth. You can even tell if a ship is close by listening to his propeller sounds. In addition, your crew offers digitized responses--which are always appropriate and professional--to many of your commands. <P>Silent Hunter offers great depth of play. Randomly generated campaign missions, realistic settings that have you swearing at your crew, and sounds that place you IN a submarine are the great strengths that set this product apart from its competition. While the enemy AI will make you scratch your head in puzzlement at times, it offers an acceptable challenge for a wide variety of skill levels. In the end, Silent Hunter is one part game, two parts simulator ... but entertaining through and through. <I>--Kevin Mical </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Mortyr - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>Mortyr: Schloss</i> is the first episode of a first-person game being developed by MirageMedia S.C. of Poland.', ""The plot begins in an alternate reality where Earth is ruled by the Nazi Reich. The Nazis managed to win World War II by constructing a time machine and receiving a powerful artifact from the far future--an artifact that gave them military supremacy in the world's battlefields. Today, in 2093, nobody remembers the way the world was before. The leaders have successfully misplaced history, and people know the ruling Nazism as the everyday reality. But life is never that simple. One of the military scientists, Gen. Jurgen Mortyr, and his science crew have connected the growing number of world's disasters, weather, and gravity anomalies with the development and usage of a still-secret time machine. Tests have confirmed the theory that the time travels indeed are the cause of growing cataclysms. Very soon, the cataclysms are due to connect into a great collapse that would destroy the planet. Thus Jurgen and his cooperatives make the only possible decision--to destroy this line of time, to bring life back as it should be. They want to send a trusted person to the past, to the pivotal point in time--the creation of the first time machine--to destroy it and prevent its creators from making the next one."", ""Yes, but who should go? The best and only choice is Jurgen's son, Sebastian. As a perfectly trained killing machine, the youngest instructor of the elite fighting teams, he was perfect to fulfill such a task. The task wasn't meant to be hard, anyway--transported precisely to the chamber of the time machine's inventor, Sebastian was to kill him, set the detonators, and get back a while before the explosion."", 'Unfortunately, it was probably a calculation error that made Sebastian appear in a small chapel outside the castle. Left alone without any weapons, our hero still has a mission to complete. And here is the place where you come in... if you dare.', ""Few concepts are as inseparable as time travel and the Third Reich. No matter what the ultimate destination, your average time traveler will at least consider stopping off to kill Hitler. Mortyr, by Polish developer Mirage Media, is a first-person shooter about traveling through time to kill Nazis. You'd think it's a can't-miss idea; Nazis are second only to vicious alien bugs as an enemy everyone can agree to hate, and the time travel element means, if nothing else, you should be able to exact a sweet, punishing revenge with your futuristic superweapons. But Mortyr manages to get almost everything wrong. It's a toss-up as to whether the game is terrible by design or just half-finished. In Mortyr, you go back in time to change the results of World War II. Oddly, you're not trying to alter the fact that the Nazis won the conflict and now control the world but instead are attempting to fix the weather they inadvertently screwed up. It's as if the developers thought a future ruled by the Third Reich wasn't reason enough to revise the past. The story is disposable though. Other than a few paragraphs in the manual and some in-game book items that provide several sentences of extra plot, you'll have no sense that anything resembling a story is progressing over the course of the game. Mortyr follows the exact structure put in place by id Software's seminal first-person shooter, Wolfenstein 3D: move forward, gather munitions and health, kill Nazis and their pet dogs, then collect a key to unlock the next area where you'll do exactly the same thing. Unfortunately, Mortyr's similarity to Wolfenstein runs no deeper than its structure. In its time, Wolfenstein was effective because it was original, technologically innovative, and fun. Mortyr is none of these things. Mirage created its own 3D engine for the game, and if you absolutely had to pick Mortyr's best feature, that's it. Even Mortyr's detractors, which should include anyone who has ever played or will ever play Mortyr, must grudgingly admit that the game sometimes looks good. A few of the levels have some impressive visuals, such as a high-ceilinged cathedral with a reflective floor. The mood is appropriately grim - there are lots of thick stone walls adorned with plenty of Nazi paraphernalia. But the graphics lack enough variety to keep them interesting all the way, or even part of the way, to the end. The switch from 1944 to 2093, which occurs about halfway through the game, fails to enliven the proceedings. Mortyr's future looks amazingly like Mortyr's past with a few neon swastikas. <i>--Erik Wolpaw </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Their mission: to be the first to steal the secret data and make a successful getaway. But it won't be easy! The data is hidden in a building filled with deadly maze rooms booby traps and other sinister surprises!"", ""Two of MAD Magazine's most popular characters have become more popular of late thanks to their appearance on the aforementioned humor publication's Saturday Night Live clone. Don't think, however, that this game has been released just to cash in on their recent upsurge - this is a colorized version of an early '90s release, which in turn was based on a Commodore 64 game released nigh on 15 years ago. So much for being on the cutting edge, eh? The gameplay basically goes like a prototype capture the flag. White and black operate in their own flick-screen window, moving from one area of the level to another, looking for goodies. In each stage there are four essential spy-related items for you to find before getting shot, stabbed, blown up, or electrocuted. Each screen has areas for your spy to search or leave traps for the unsuspecting opponent to discover. These traps make Spy Vs. Spy such a hilarious experience. Put a bucket of water above a door, and, with a bit of luck, you are soon treated to the sight of your hapless foe receiving an unexpected dose of H2O. If you can't think of any tricks to pull on the scenery, you can always just go and throw the other spy a well-timed punch or two. Knocking them out is vital, so you have more time to search for those precious documents. Find all four, and you can escape in a nearby getaway plane. For a game that worked perfectly in black and white, Spy Vs. Spy makes excellent use of the new color capabilities. Being able to identify your location simply by the color of the walls in the room you're in makes the gameplay a lot smoother than having to look at the always accessible map. This is essential when you're enjoying a two-player linked game, and the race against time is really on. Everything else is pretty much the same as before, which translates as merely adequate these days. The gameplay is still as addictive as ever, although playing against a computer is nowhere near as much fun as taking on a real live human challenger (as opposed to a dead one?). Spy Vs. Spy is a fast-paced, comedic strategy title especially suited for the more vindictive of players (which is pretty much all of us, really).<i>--Cameron Davis</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Virtua Striker 2,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games']",{},"[""Fresh from the arcades, <i>Virtua Striker 2</i> lobs the  international soccer phenomenon onto the Sega Dreamcast in the system's  signature arcade-perfect form. Players compete as 1 of 32 international  teams, detailed down to the members' uniforms and playing styles. The  game features six modes of play, including arcade (familiar to fans of  the standup version), international cut, tournament, league, ranking  mode, and match play. As the most dedicated soccer fanatic expects, the  gameplay is highly detailed and the action is fast and furious. The  realistic, motion-captured players perform a plethora of stylish moves,  including bicycle kicks, headers, and slide tackles. One cool feature:  as the virtual clock ticks away the hours from morning through evening,  the environmental lighting adjusts accordingly. Of course, a social  game like soccer is twice as fun with a fellow Pel&eacute; wannabe,  which is why there's a head-to-head two-person multiplayer mode."", 'Soccer, or ""football,"" as some would have it, is the world\'s most popular sport. That said, it\'s not unreasonable to assume that any time a soccer video game is released to the general public, it goes under the microscope as closely as one might critique a basketball game for accuracy and ""feel."" Very few of the myriad soccer games released have approached the upper echelon of what most people consider ""an excellent soccer game."" The games that have done so most recently have been titles like EA\'s FIFA, Konami\'s International Superstar Soccer, and Sega\'s World Wide Soccer. Interestingly, it is Sega that has created the Dreamcast\'s first soccer game, and surprisingly, it does not hail from the accurately detailed World Wide series. Instead, Sega\'s first ""footie"" title comes home from the arcade in the form of Virtua Striker 2. Virtua Striker 2 is as simple as a soccer game can get, and it\'s a soccer game that, against all reason, is incredibly popular in Japanese arcades. Practically as popular as Virtua Fighter and Virtual On in its country of origin, Virtua Striker has somehow managed to forge itself a devoted following, making this one of the more highly anticipated titles to come to the Dreamcast. While Sega would probably like to think of Virtua Striker 2 in the same breath as games like NFL Blitz or NBA Showtime, due to their extreme playability, this is absolutely not the case. Virtua Striker 2 was designed to provide a stadium-like sensation, along with all that implies. Not since Namco\'s Libero Grande have you ever had the sensation of being on the field as much as you do in VS 2. What\'s significant is that a game like this was only recently made possible due to the Dreamcast\'s powerful hardware. However, that doesn\'t save this game from being a clunker. The game is incredibly beautiful, but in the gameplay, where it counts, the game falls miserably short. To begin with, there is no analog control. While the arcade version featured the standard eight-way joystick, and not true analog, the Dreamcast version would have benefited from analog greatly due to the overly stiff control the D-pad provides. Secondly, never during a game do you feel as if you really have control over your players. This is partly due to the horrible auto-select feature the computer provides. What this means is that the computer selects which player you control, and the choice doesn\'t always make sense. Often, the computer automatically switches you to a player that\'s not even onscreen. Other times, while you\'re chasing a ball, another member of your team, coming from the opposite direction, will come within striking distance of the ball. The computer automatically switches your controller to this player, instantly switching the direction of your controller and taking away any sense of interaction with the player you might have tentatively had. It never gets better either. Goalie control? Bah! Good luck! Your other controls consist of short pass, long pass, slide kick, and offense realignment. While this sounds streamlined and dandy, it never seems to work to your benefit. The computer is agile and very adept at taking the ball from you every two seconds, something that, unfortunately, doesn\'t seem to work the other way around. Frustratingly, your only method of defense, aside from trying to steal the ball, is a slide-tackle. Despite the simplified interface, where throw-ins and goal kicks are handled via an onscreen button prompt, the game is anything but simple. One-touch kicks are nothing short of impossible to do because of the ""innovative"" power meter. The power meter functions like a swing-meter in a golf game. Instead of instant pass-shoot one-touch shots on goal, you must pause (even while running) to hold down the shoot button for an indeterminate amount of time before you can kick. Early experience will find you shooting far wide of the goal, often missing by a mile. There are many other jarring problems, including an almost total lack of voice commentary - the only vocal sample powerful enough to stick is the incredibly grating ""GOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!!!!"" that some loudmouth bellows every time someone scores. You\'re also stuck with one lousy camera angle that, while functional, gets boring quickly for people who like a top-down, or side-scrolling view in their soccer games. There\'s no FIFA license in case you were wondering. The list goes on and on, but the biggest crime this game commits is the complete and utter lack of playability. While there are loads of tournament, arcade, and versus modes available, they all play badly and are no fun, in equal proportions. Perhaps the biggest and most offensive omission is the lack of four-player gaming. Virtua Striker 2 only supports two-player action, which is incomprehensible, considering the four controller ports on the front of the Dreamcast.  Graphically, the game is wonderful to look at, if you like looking from one stinking camera angle the whole time. Character models, though, are built with oodles of polygons, giving them a nice hi-res, full-bodied look, which is impossible on the PlayStation or N64. Motion capture was put to good use here, as every player moves smoothly and fluidly, but again, this never carries over into the gameplay. When games like FIFA 99 almost completely get it right, with control a deliberate and conscientious thing, Virtua Striker\'s faults become obvious far too quickly. With Namco developing a soccer game (World Kicks) on Sega\'s Naomi board, and Konami whipping up an International Super Star Soccer for DC, there are far better possibilities for DC soccer playing looming on the horizon. Even without the third-party competition, it would even be difficult to recommend VS2 as a rental. A hi-res example of how not to design a soccer game, Virtua Striker 2 is a classic example of good ideas gone horribly wrong. Avoid at all costs.  <I>--James Mielke </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

NHL 2K - Sega Dreamcast,,"['Sega Dreacast', 'E-Everybody']","['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""In the tradition of <I>NBA 2K</I> and <I>NFL 2K</I>, two of the finest console sports games to date, Sega's <I>NHL 2K</I> aims to score big as the most realistic hockey simulation game ever seen. Those who've witnessed the capabilities of this game's predecessors know what to expect: hyperrealistic gameplay, TV-perfect camera angles, jaw-dropping graphics, expert game commentary, and other fine details that capture the spirit of the sport."", 'The game is licensed by the NHL and NHLPA, which allowed the developers to include many of the fine details on and off the ice. Teams and players from six NHL divisions are accurately represented in the game. The motion-captured, detailed player models perform as one expects from professional hockey players, right down to custom special plays. With play-by-play commentary by Hall of Fame announcer Bob Cole, and color commentary by ex-NHL coach Harry Neale, <I>NHL 2K</I> seeks to put other hockey games on ice.', 'NHL 2K had so many expectations to live up to. It had to stand up to the high standards set by its NFL 2K and NBA 2K counterparts. And it had to be better than EA\'s NHL series, a series EA Sports has had years to finesse. How do you even begin to make a hockey game that can fill these tall orders? You get a talented developer like Blackbox, and tell them that you want it ready right around the time the all-star game rolls around. Many things have been said about NHL 2K, and perhaps everyone\'s expectations were too high. Sure, NHL 2K doesn\'t offer quite as extensive a create-a-player mode as its 2K cousins, and it certainly doesn\'t have all of the modes and options that games like NHL 2000 on the PlayStation or N64 had. But it does have everything required to deliver an amazingly realistic hockey experience that more than deserves to be called great. There are many elements that have to be just right for any type of sports game to have the right feel. One of the most important, obviously, is control. This is something the team at Blackbox has elegantly simplified to make playing NHL 2K more about what you do in the game, on the ice, than what buttons you push on your controller. NHL 2K has a very simple control scheme that on the surface may seem limited, but after spending some time with the game you\'ll realize that the control scheme is much deeper, letting you do almost all of the moves you could in other hockey games just by using the analog stick. For instance, in most other hockey games if you want to skate backward you push a button. In NHL 2K when you\'re the defending player you automatically face the skater with the puck, leaving you free either to check him before he ever gets the shot off or to lie out in front of the puck to block the shot. Even deeper is the level of control you have over the placement of your shot. The instant you press the shoot button and your player rears his stick back for the shot you can actually use the analog stick to place the shot. Pressing up and down varies the height of the shot while left and right of course steers the puck in the corresponding direction. When you\'re all alone on a breakaway, there\'s no deke button to press to magically throw off the goalie - it\'s all you. You either have the skill with the analog stick to fake him out or you don\'t. In terms of responsiveness, the game controls very tight, and the nature of the analog stick makes playing NHL 2K feel even more natural than its football and basketball counterparts. While some will surely see this simplified control scheme as a negative, those who learn how the game works will love to ""\'play"" NHL 2K and never give the control scheme a second thought. Aside from control, there are a ton of other important aspects that play into how a game feels. One is the speed at which the game plays. Many people have varied opinions on just how fast real hockey is - thankfully, NHL 2K features an adjustable speed setting. Even though the game\'s default setting feels very representative of the actual speed at which real hockey plays, the adjustable setting is nice to have. Another important quality, especially for hockey, is physics. Both the player physics and puck physics are wonderful. The puck skips, rolls, and flies out of play after getting blasted off the top of someone\'s skate very realistically. The player physics are also very true to life: Players with more girth than others have an easier time of taking out smaller skaters, but since the checking system is momentum based, you can take out big guys with little guys if you get \'em going fast enough. As fans know, the AI of the computer-controlled players always makes or breaks a hockey game. Fortunately, NHL 2K\'s AI is decent enough to appease both the casual video-game hockey fan as well as the seasoned hockey veteran. One characteristic about NHL 2K\'s AI that will split opinions is that it is very true to the sport of hockey. If you just watch hockey on TV for the fights and don\'t understand the purpose of the different positions and their roles in performing basic shot setups, you\'ll be wondering why some of the players are just milling about. If this is the case, you can just turn off some of the rules like offsides and icing. Then you can set the offense to aggressive and defense to intimidate, and you\'re set. However if you do know all of the intricacies of hockey, NHL 2K is a very satisfying game to play. When set on rookie, the computer AI isn\'t a slouch. It just doesn\'t play aggressively, and it gives you more time with the puck to learn how to play. On pro, however, the computer (depending on which team it\'s controlling) is either competent or it just wins. On all pro, the computer is an animal. It uses the enforcers to crush you when it can, and the teams finesse players just to take the puck away from you when it can\'t. Oh, and then it makes a goal. But seriously, the different AI settings are quite good, offering enough variety to be challenging to anyone, at any level. But as mentioned before, knowing the difference between what the Flyers\' center Eric Lindros does best, and what the team\'s left wing Mark Recchi can do in real life, makes a big difference, as it should. Graphically, NHL 2K (like its football and basketball cousins) easily earns the title of the most visually accurate, jaw-dropping game in its sport. Everything in the game looks simply amazing - the players, the ice, the arenas, the spectators, everything. The player models used in the game are literally the most detailed ever, each comprised of 1,500 polygons. This extremely high polygon count gives the players a realistic, round, smooth-skinned look. In addition, 800 of the top players in the game actually have their real-life counterpart\'s face mapped right onto their polygonal head. This technique of using the real faces of the actual athletes depicted in the game, along with the super-smooth player models, gives the players in NHL 2K an insanely realistic look. When these features are combined with the more than 700 fluid motion-captured animations, the game looks and moves just like the real thing. The first time you see a player jump over a fallen teammate as he picks up the loose puck, you\'ll just have to say ""Wow."" The same is true for the first time you send the puck smashing through the glass and it violently explodes. There are a lot of other little visual effects that make the game look convincing - things like facial expressions, real-time ice deterioration, reflections off the ice and glass, and even ice shavings that spray off the ice when players stop and turn abruptly. You can view the action from several camera angles, the best of which happens to be the game\'s default angle, which is a typical slightly tilted overhead view that follows the action from one end of the rink to the other. The only real difference at all is that this view is dynamic, slightly zooming in and out depending on the situation. Compared with the visual standard that NFL 2K and NBA 2K set, NHL 2K has more to amaze you with, but overall it just doesn\'t look quite as smooth. Even with that said, the game is still definitely something that must be seen. <I>--Ryan Mac Donald </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

After the doomsday event, the earth is being rebuilt under the threat of trouble erupting again.

A very Zelda-like inventory system is extremely handy, and the game relies heavily on special items. While <i>Crystalis</i> doesn't come close to offering up the same level of gaming experience as other games in this genre, it does offer an entertaining quest nonetheless.

Get on your leathers and fire up your PC for the most realistic and exhilarating racing simulation of any kind. Prove you can handle 150 horsepowers with the most faithfully modeled bikes, bike physics, riders, and tracks ever seen. <i>Superbike 2000</i> also takes motorcycle racing online with Internet racing.', 'EA Sports\' Superbike 2000 is one of the most realistic and accurate motorcycle racing games out there. A wide variety of tracks and bikes and gorgeous animations and graphics offset the game\'s steep learning curve and will keep you coming back for more. <P> Superbike 2000 has gameplay options similar to those in many other PC racing sims. The game\'s career mode lets you select a factory bike and rider and enter a series of races that span 13 weekends. Each weekend is composed of a number of racing events that include two free practice sessions, two qualifying sessions, a superpole, and two final races. The practice sessions are designed to give you a better feel of the bike and let you make any necessary changes without any consequence to your overall standings. Your performance during the qualifying and superpole events then determines the starting grid of the final races, and you move on to the next track after you successfully complete them. <P> The game has four difficulty settings that you can change anytime during the game. The four levels toggle assists like automatic transmission, automatic rider movement, crash recovery, extra brake power, and automatic braking. Those who don\'t know a lot about the dynamics of riding a motorcycle would do well to select some of the assists. With the difficulty set to ""real,"" which offers no assists at all, Superbike 2000 becomes a serious challenge. Unlike cars, motorcycles don\'t have the luxury of turning and stopping on a dime, so you\'ll need to keep your eyes as far down the track as possible in anticipation of upcoming turns and traffic. A steady hand is necessary when taking turns, as too much braking will cause the bike to slide out from underneath the rider, and too much throttle will result in a spectacular crash. <P> In addition to simply keeping the bike on all two wheels, you also have to contend with constantly adjusting the rider\'s center of gravity. Moving the rider to a higher position will allow for better cornering and stability through turns, while keeping him low and close to the bike will make for higher top speeds and stability through the straights. The manual rider adjustment and touchy bike controls might seem a burden at first, but die-hard motorcycle racing fans will undoubtedly welcome the game\'s sense of realism. <P> The bikes in Superbike 2000 include factory rides from Ducati, Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Aprilia. Each of the six bikes not only looks and sounds different, but has unique handling characteristics as well. For instance, the Ducati 996 SPS and Suzuki Alstare GSX-R750 aren\'t necessarily the quickest bikes on the field, but their overall stability is attractive to novices, while the brute force of the Honda RC45 and Kawasaki ZX-7RR is better suited for more aggressive racers. Though the difference between one bike and another won\'t be instantly apparent, you\'ll gradually settle on a favorite after a few laps with each. <P> Superbike 2000 is built around an advanced version of the Superbike World Championship engine, and features bikes, riders, tracks, and scenery that look markedly improved over the original. The detail found in the bikes is quite impressive, as everything from the grooves in the front cross-drilled rotors to the aluminum-tipped exhaust pipes is clearly depicted and can be easily identified on all the bike models. Even details as minor as the glare coming off of the instrument cluster have been accounted for in Superbike 2000. The tracks and their surrounding environments are also accurately modeled after their real-world counterparts and are some of the best looking that you\'ll find in any racing game. <P> The rider animations don\'t look quite as good, but they do include an array of movements that capture the essence of motorcycle racing. For example, computer-controlled riders will constantly twist their heads sideways to take a look at the rest of the pack after each turn or shake their fists in anger after being cut off. In the first-person perspective, your rider\'s hand will twist progressively downward as you feed the throttle, and his left will work the clutch every time you shift gears. The realistic animations, coupled with the game\'s crisp graphics, result in replays that are the closest a racing game has ever come to rendering TV-quality visuals on the PC. <P> There\'s no soundtrack of any kind during races in Superbike 2000, and the sporadic commentary from the game\'s British announcer comes only during the start of each race and after a crash. However, the engine noises and exhaust notes have all been sampled from real-world bikes and don\'t ever become overly annoying as is common in some racing games. <P> Both visually and technically, Superbike 2000 is an accurate representation of SBK racing that will appeal to novice and expert racers alike. Once you get past the learning curve, you\'ll find Superbike 2000 to be one of the most realistic racing games to date. <BR>--<I>Amer Ajami</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc.

Power-hungry generals are all vying for control of NOD, yet each has a markedly different opinion on how to reclaim the Brotherhood's status as a viable threat to the GDI. Kane's Cairo temple, like his dreams, lies in ruins, swarmed by GDI scientists searching for clues that'll help them stop the onslaught of a more insidious enemy: Tiberium itself."", ""Named after the Tiber River where it was first discovered, Tiberium is now rapidly spreading across the planet like a virus, destroying all ecosystems and life-forms that stand in its destructive path. Tiberium was introduced to Earth by a meteorite and was at one time seen as a miracle resource: limitless in its abundance and harmless to others. Its disastrous effects quickly came to light, however, and the toxic crystal has all but leeched the planet's entire supply of naturally occurring metals and minerals. Life-forms that aren't instantly killed by exposure to Tiberium are affected on their genetic level and slowly mutate into hideous, almost alien, creatures. Even the oceans have become infested with Tiberium, making sea voyages not only difficult, but lethal as well."", ""Desperate to find a way to stem Tiberium's alarming rate of growth, the Global Defense Initiative has raided the now-destroyed NOD temple in Cairo in search of the Tacitus, an alien artifact that could explain the origins of Tiberium. Kane had been using the Tacitus to mutate his troops in bizarre Tiberium experiments and as a result was able to successfully genetically engineer his cyborg units. The GDI now hopes that the same artifact responsible for Tiberium's destructive march across the planet will be able to stop the crystal's spread and save humanity from extinction."", '<b>The Opening Sequences</b>', '<i>Firestorm</i> consists of 18 new missions: nine for the Global Defense Initiative and nine for the Brotherhood of NOD. Unlike <i>Tiberian Sun</i>, the central character of the expansion pack is you, the player, and not some onscreen actor. Other characters will address you in the second person and comment on your performance; applauding you for successful missions and criticizing you for failed actions. Fans of the original Command & Conquer and the subsequent Red Alert will undoubtedly be pleased by this move.', 'The expansion pack boasts some new features, including an extension to the plot of the <i>Command & Conquer</i> series. Fans of the previous games will no doubt find it a very welcome bonus. Like in all other games in this series, you will be able to play as the dominating Global Defense Initiative or the overzealous Brotherhood of NOD, and the story on both sides will occur concurrently, ending with the same finale.', ""The GDI story unfolds with researchers removing the Tacitus from NOD's Cairo temple and loading it onto the Kodiak, the GDI's airborne headquarters that first made its appearance in <i>Tiberian Sun</i>. Immediately thereafter, however, the Kodiak encounters a severe ion storm and crash-lands near the coast of North Africa. Your first mission is to find the downed Kodiak, using only a limited number of infantry and ground-support units, and extract the Tacitus artifact. The rest of the storyline focuses on the Tacitus and the GDI researchers' efforts to learn the origins of the alien artifact, what role it plays in the introduction of Tiberium on Earth, and what, if anything, can be done to stop the crystal's toxic spread."", '<b>Added Features</b>', ""In developing <i>Firestorm</i>, the designers at Westwood knew they were on a tight schedule and didn't have much time to experiment with many new options. From the start, Firestorm was supposed to be an expansion pack that simply added more missions to <i>Tiberian Sun</i>, extending the game's replayability and making the wait for the next game in the <i>Command & Conquer</i> series a bit easier on the fans. Thankfully, the design team decided to do better than that and push through actual gameplay additions."", 'Not content with simply releasing a ""mission pack,"" and knowing that gamers will want to see more added value in <i>Firestorm</i>, the designers will implement a number of changes. None of them are drastic enough to change the face of the original <i>Tiberian Sun</i>, but they\'re big enough to make <i>Firestorm</i> a worthwhile purchase for fans. One of the more significant changes will be the addition of a new multiplayer mode called World Domination.', '""We\'ve created a new mode of Internet game called World Domination Tour, where players fight for GDI or Nod in contested territories in an attempt to take over the world,"" explains <i>Firestorm</i> lead producer Rade Stojsavljevic. ""World Domination Tour functions as a graphical ladder, where players fight in contested zones and we tally up the scores at the end of the day and award control of that zone to whichever side has more victories. As the game progresses, the battle lines are advanced until one side takes over everything, at which point the battle is reset and begins again.""', '<b>Final Thoughts</b>', '<i>Tiberian Sun</i> was criticized by many for not offering anything new in terms of gameplay, despite the introduction of a brand-new graphics engine, new units, and new actors. But the game sold very well, and cutting through the many voices of discontent came praise from many gamers who were more than pleased with the outcome of the third installment in the <i>Command & Conquer</i> series. <i>Firestorm</i>, with its new units, varied multiplayer modes, and integral plot, will give owners of <i>Tiberian Sun</i> something to be excited about. And for those who were undecided about buying the original game, this expansion should add reason to finally do so. <P><i>--Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""From Q-School to Tour Championship, <i>Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 2000</i> captures the realism, beauty, and accuracy of PGA Tour golf on your computer. It's easy to play but hard to master. Earn your way onto the elite PGA Tour, play on a variety of premier courses, and immerse yourself in the life of a Tour pro. Plus, you can expand your game with the PGA Tour System of Golf and the growing EA Sports library of world-class courses. You also can add your own creations with the Course Architect."", ""Considering that the first incarnation of Electronic Arts' PGA Tour golf-sim series first appeared nearly a decade ago, it's only natural to expect that the latest installment would be the most finely honed golf simulation on the market. That's certainly been the case with other EA Sports games - just look at how much EA Sports improved Madden NFL, NHL Hockey, FIFA Soccer, and NBA Live over the years. But while Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 scores high marks in crucial areas like course selection and multiplayer support, it has a host of minor omissions and other problems, as well as some serious technical issues, that keep it from reaching the upper echelon of golf sims. <P> One of the big selling points in the PGA Tour line has been the ability to play as or against virtual versions of PGA Tour pros, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 adds several new faces to the roster: Mark Calcavecchia, Stewart Cink, Robert Damron, and Justin Leonard, to be precise. Of course Tiger is here, and in a creative double-dip move, EA tapped into its Michael Jordan license to put His Airness out on the links (though if I were M. J. I'd be a little miffed at how poorly my sprite had been rendered). There are nine pros in all (the box says ten) - a far cry from the dozens of PGA players of that first EA game years ago, but still a lot more than any other golf sim currently offers. <P> Competing against these cyberpros is definitely a blast, but many fans prefer developing their own star player rather than taking on an existing PGA persona - and here Tiger Woods 2000 falls far short of what you're able to do in other golf sims. Not counting Jordan, you can choose from only three character animations (two female and one male). While it's true that you can import a .BMP image of yourself into the game, it only appears during the golfer selection screen and as a small thumbnail at the top left of the screen during play: The actual onscreen golfer remains unchanged. You can't even choose what color shirt to wear. This might seem like a minor concern at best, but at the same time it's a real letdown compared with the comprehensive player editor in Sierra's PGA Championship Golf, or even the multiple player animations of Jack Nicklaus 6 or Links LS 2000. <P> On the other hand, the selection of courses in Tiger Woods 2000 is outstanding. Besides the game's exclusive rights to Pebble Beach, there are seven TPC courses encompassing a broad spectrum of surroundings, from the dry desert biospheres of Summerlin and Scottsdale to the tree-lined hills of Piper Glen to the gently rolling fairways of Heron Bay. With support for add-on courses released for Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf 99 and The Tiger Woods Collection, its diversity of courses is one area in which Tiger Woods 2000 doesn't disappoint. This is also the first time in the series that EA Sports has included a course architect to let you design your own course or make replicas of your favorite real-life links. While I found it a bit more cumbersome to use than the course editor in PGA Championship Golf, it's certainly functional and definitely beefs up the game's replay value. <BR>--<I>Stephen Poole</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc.

You can follow the story line in an open or linear fashion. <I>X: Beyond the Frontier</I> allows you to operate 150 types of spacecraft and space stations as well as encounter up to 10,000 objects within the universe."", ""In this game, you are the pilot of an experimental craft that accidentally drops you into an unknown sector of the universe. As you journey, you'll encounter different civilizations and experience their unique customs. But be aware: diplomacy is not always the answer. Cooperating with one race could easily make you the deadly enemy of another. Your mission is simple--stay alive."", 'Some space combat games offer plenty of white-knuckled dogfighting action that\'s just as intense as any first-person shooter could ever claim to be. X - Beyond the Frontier is not one of those games. In fact, if you aren\'t the sort of gamer who likes the idea of spending countless hours exploring the far reaches of virtual space, fighting occasionally but spending most of your time tinkering with finances, then X - Beyond the Frontier is not for you. On the other hand, if you\'re a grizzled veteran of Elite and Privateer, then X - Beyond the Frontier will definitely bring back fond memories of those classic, open-ended games of space exploration and financial exploitation. Developed by German software house EgoSoft, X puts you in control of Earth\'s first light-speed-capable spacecraft, the X Prototype. But something goes wrong during the first test flight, and you suddenly find yourself transported to a distant, alien galaxy. Unarmed and unprotected, you encounter the Teladi, an alien race fixated on trade and profit. They outfit your ship with some basic shields, sensor software that lets you maneuver between systems, and a few credits with which to buy goods for trade - but they also leave you with a sizeable debt that they expect you to pay back soon. And so your adventure begins as you set out in search of some way to earn enough money to pay back the Teladi. Gameplay in X is very open-ended, though there is a plot lurking about somewhere in the background. You aren\'t forced to follow the plot, however. In fact, the game almost encourages you not to follow it, since you are free to explore space at your leisure, buy and sell goods, fight pirates and evil aliens, and even purchase and manage your own space-born factories and mines. Given enough time, you can establish a massive, interstellar financial empire if you play your cards right. X comes with only a skimpy manual that explains few of the game\'s most important intricacies, which was apparently an intentional design decision. How to purchase a factory or mine - one of the key features of the game - is left for you to discover on your own. You must also learn how to hire freighters and fighters to service and protect your possessions. Other matters, such as the best places to find better shields, powerful weapons, and various trading commodities, are also left unexplained. Where to find good deals and better equipment might not seem like the sort of information that should be in the manual, but when every commodity in the game is sold by a different space station - and not every kind of station can be found in every system - you can end up spending an awful lot of time looking for what you need. It also doesn\'t help that you must manually identify each installation in a new system, rather than simply download a sector map on entry. However, exploring is the name of the game, and if you don\'t get frustrated by X \'s snail\'s pace in the first 10-20 minutes, chances are you\'ll love the experience of flying from system to system. Six different alien races occupy the game\'s 50-plus systems, each with its own sphere of influence and array of commodities and space-station designs. There is some crossover between the races, such as the identical-looking inner doors on virtually all space stations, but for the most part each race has a distinctive appearance. Fortunately, you don\'t necessarily have to travel from system to system to make a buck, as you would in Elite or Privateer. For example, you can buy energy units at a system\'s power plant and sell them at a factory or mine in the same system. Doing so can save you a lot of time, since you begin the game without a time-acceleration feature (which must be purchased as an add-on from an equipment supplier), and travel in X is a time-consuming process. After as little as an hour of gameplay, with some shrewd trading on your part, you should be able to outfit your X ship with a pair of lasers, a larger cargo bay, a navigational computer and the time-accelerating ""singularity time distortion engine."" After that, continued trading can quickly yield enough cash to purchase your own power plant or other installation. You even get to display your own logo on each installation you own (with a picture of your favorite Simpsons character, for example). Keep your installation protected from Xenon ships and supply them with the resources they require, and you\'ll soon have a fortune on your hands. You can even buy some freighters for your larger installations, and as long as they have access to money, they will go out and bring back all the resources necessary to keep the installation running. Then all you have to do is set your selling price for the installation\'s end product and watch the profits roll in. <I>--Michael E. Ryan </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Controls are simple but  effective. You can lay prone (a good way to disappear into mud or tall  grass), press up against walls, and easily access an inventory screen  to equip and use items. You'll find a plethora of weapons along the  way, perfect for those moments when stealth alone just isn't going to  cut it."", ""The graphics are great, but it's the spot-on accurate control that  makes this game truly shine.

Silent Hill,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation']",{},"['In a recent interview with OPM, Silent Hill\'s creators remarked that one of their main goals with the game was to frighten people on an instinctive level, and that\'s something that, in my mind, they\'ve clearly succeeded at doing. While similar horror titles, like Capcom\'s Resident Evil series, work well at making you jump in a ""boo!"" sort of way, Silent Hill establishes a very unsettling atmosphere that at once puts you off and creeps you out. Silent Hill accomplishes this through a host of wonderful little touches: a radio that emits static whenever monsters are near, a lead character that must catch his breath after running, the placement of wheelchairs and broken stretchers in abandoned stairwells, and so on. One of the most successfully unnerving elements is the game\'s lighting, which is almost always cast from a flashlight, whether you are in a dark alleyway, a fog-enshrouded back street, or a dank basement. The glare it gives off obscures almost as much as it illuminates, like a dying candle. It was that effect, much more than any fearsome creature, which made me leave a hall light on one night after playing it. That\'s not to say that the monster design is under par though. In fact, there was one species in particular - a shaggy man-thing that barks and sets after you on all fours - that sent a chill up the back of my neck every time I saw one. To back up a bit, Silent Hill begins with a car accident that separates the main character, Harry Mason, from his daughter. He wanders around looking for her in the off-season resort town that they had happened upon, encountering things and events that seem inspired at least in part by horror writers H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King (anyone remember The Mist?). Figuring out what\'s actually going on in the burg is much more of a draw for the player than discovering where some little girl has made off to, but both quests lead you around the streets, houses, and major buildings of a fairly convincing 3D Midwestern town. Aside from a slightly grainy cast to Silent Hill\'s look, its graphics are pretty tight. The use of fog and darkness work so well to enhance the game\'s mood that you don\'t mind that they\'re obviously hiding pop-up (perhaps your suspension of disbelief is withheld so that you ignore it or something), and the lighting effects produced by the character\'s flashlight are often jaw-dropping. The sound effects are likewise very strong, with scary monster growls (as I\'ve mentioned before), random clanks and crashes that force you to turn around and inspect a room you\'re sure is empty, and eerie piping that wafts in throughout. Imagine an instance in which all these elements are combined: You\'re in a dark courtyard, and snow is coming down. Your flashlight only illuminates a few feet ahead of you, but you know something\'s there with you because your radio is blaring static, and you\'ve heard some indescribable something out there make a noise. You draw your gun and... wait, while the music builds. This sort of event makes for some very tense and very entertaining moments, and the game definitely repeats and serves them quite often.  On the downside, Silent Hill\'s storyline doesn\'t deliver nearly the payoff promised throughout. You can beat the game without learning some of its most important plot points and, without a doubt, the first time you win you\'ll be left wondering what the hell happened and if that was really it. And it\'s not. There are four different endings within Silent Hill that are reached based on your performance during some key moments. Personally, I hate when developers try to extend the life of a game by making you play it through more than once. But at its base, Silent Hill still has a decent amount of play to it. A handful of well-designed puzzles keeps the game from being too short; it\'s just a shame you can\'t learn everything you want to know the first time through. Another gripe is that the game camera suffers from the same problem as many other third-person-game cameras: It always seems to fail you when you need it the most. It\'s the lack of a real climax that probably hurts the game the most, but the perspective can be vexing as well. In the end, though, Konami\'s first entry in the horror genre - while not quite up to the mark of Capcom\'s Resident Evil 2 - is a great beginning. Let\'s hope we\'ve seen the start of a new franchise by the company, because this would be an excellent starting point.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Total Annihilation: Kingdoms Expansion - The Iron Plague,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Massive armies clash. Forests and cities burn. Tremendous magical forces level entire fortresses in the blink of an eye. Four completely unique races are vying for control of Darien, each representing one of the four elements--Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.', ""In <i>Total Annihilation: Kingdoms,</i> you'll take the role of one of the four immortal monarchs of these nations at war. You'll rally your legions--swordsmen, archers, and knights on horseback--under your flag. Wizards, beasts, and even flame-spewing demons will heed your every command, waging war on an epic field of battle."", ""The game's stunning 3-D terrain of forests, magic-laden ruins, and expansive oceans provides a landscape of war fraught with danger, magic, and ambush."", ""Total Annihilation: Kingdoms hit the market last year and met with extremely high expectations. After all, the game was a follow-up to the immensely successful Total Annihilation, and fans of the original game couldn't wait to get their hands on what they hoped would be an even better development of Total Annihilation's design. But many played Kingdoms and came away disappointed; the game lacked both the strategic flow and the tactical niceties of its predecessor, and the fantasy setting didn't fit as well as the first game's sci-fi setting. Kingdoms was decent, and offered many hours of good strategy gameplay for a lot of people, but it never lived up to its name."", ""Enter The Iron Plague, Cavedog's sub-$20 add-on for Kingdoms. The Iron Plague is merely an expansion pack for Kingdoms rather than a complete redesign, so you shouldn't expect it to change the game completely. But in a very real way it bears the burden of rescuing Kingdoms from its earlier problems, and rescuing Cavedog's good reputation with gamers. In the end, it's partly successful at both. It definitely improves the original game and also reflects Cavedog's commitment to fix what needs fixing."", ""You get quite a bit for the game's $20 price tag: You get the 2.0 game-engine upgrade patch for Kingdoms itself, along with all the new units and battle maps that Cavedog made available for Kingdoms on its site since the game was released. You also get a brand-new fifth civilization to play, which brings with it all the units, strategies, and challenges of having an entirely new playable faction in the game. Along with that civilization come 25 new battle maps, and a new campaign that has 25 single-player missions tied together with another good story. The new campaign is tougher than the original campaign, even from the start. Finally, the game CD includes the code necessary to play The Darien Crusades, a cooperative multiplayer game playable over Cavedog's online Boneyards site. This review covers only the enhancements to Kingdoms and the Iron Plague expansion itself, but do yourself a favor and give The Darien Crusades a try. You don't have to buy The Iron Plague to get the software - just head on to Boneyards and download it from there."", ""Actually, you don't have to buy the expansion pack for the 2.0 upgrade patch either, as it's also available on Cavedog's site. But it's worth describing since it's the engine that runs The Iron Plague, especially because the expansion requires pack the original game to be installed anyway. The game runs more smoothly in the 2.0 upgrade than in the original retail version of Kingdoms, which makes the gameplay acceptable even at 1600x1200 resolution if you have a good video card. The patch also addresses a major complaint with Kingdoms - the horrible frame rates during large battles - first by having the program automatically decrease graphic and animation detail as frame-rate problems occur, and also by including a feature called Kenny mode, which turns off unit animation completely in the interest of faster gameplay. You can also adjust the degree of shadowing in the game and the degree to which units will automatically switch to a lower resolution to maintain a decent frame rate. But to work with these options you must edit the Windows registry manually, which is a bad idea unless you know what you're doing."", ""Other improvements in Kingdoms version 2.0 include two additional battle maps and tweaks to the game's balance, such as knocking Veruna's dirigible down a peg by making it smaller and less powerful, and increasing the targeting and firing capabilities of the Zhon Wisp. Cavedog also claims the patch will let the game run on a P200 with as little as 32MB of RAM, though you'll want to play it on a faster system. -- <i>Neil Randall</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

Freespace 2: Sci-Fi Sim of the Year,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Interplay successfully eluded the ""sophomore slump"" with the 1999 release of <I>Freespace 2</I>. After great critical acclaim, <I>Freespace 2: Sci-Fi Sim of the Year</I> builds on the success of its predecessors, adding over 20 missions and allowing one to create, customize, and even exchange single-player and multiplayer scenarios with FRED 2, the new and improved mission editor. - Up to 12 players can battle in dogfight, team vs. team (up to 8 players), and cooperative missions via LAN, TCP/IP, or modem. New scenarios include flying with Vasudan squadrons, piloting advanced stealth fighters, and ""painting"" targets with TAG (Target Acquisition and Guidance) missiles. An in-depth combat system enables players to target and destroy subsystems, disabling engines, defensive turrets, missile batteries, and fighter bays.', 'Since the early 1990s, Totally Games\' X-Wing series and Origin Systems\' Wing Commander series have maintained a stranglehold on the space-sim genre. Until last year, the space sims released by other companies were derivative of those two series yet generally had less impressive graphics, substandard gameplay, and dull plots. But some worthy challengers finally appeared in 1998 when Particle Systems unveiled Independence War and Volition released Descent: Freespace. <P> Of those two contenders, Independence War was more original, as it featured a complex physics-modeling system and put you in charge of a large capital ship. Descent: Freespace was more of a traditional space sim, as it effectively cannibalized the best elements of the genre\'s classics in addition to providing an outstanding interface and several other refreshing innovations. But while Particle Systems\' follow-up game, Independence War Deluxe, was a mild disappointment, Volition\'s FreeSpace 2 is an outstanding sequel that significantly improves upon its enjoyable predecessor. Even if Totally Games had not effectively abandoned its X-Wing franchise earlier this year, and Origin had not decided to focus solely on multiplayer games, there\'s no doubt there\'s a new king in town. FreeSpace 2 is one of the best space sims ever made and is a solid candidate for game of the year. <P> FreeSpace 2 picks up 32 years after the events of the original game. In Descent: Freespace, a 14-year war between Terrans and Vasudans was rudely interrupted by the appearance of an ominous and technologically superior race, dubbed the Shivans. To avoid extinction, the Terrans and Vasudans were forced to set aside their differences and forge a desperate alliance. Even though Descent: Freespace concentrated most of its plot developments into the first third of the game, the story ended effectively, granting the isolated remnants of the Terran and Vasudan civilizations a Pyrrhic victory. The plot of FreeSpace 2 ties deeply into the events of the original game, but new players can quickly learn what they missed through the game\'s comprehensive and interesting database. The Terrans and Vasudans remain allied and have rebuilt their societies, but their harmony is disrupted when a rogue group of Terrans secedes from the alliance because of its apparent distrust of the Vasudans. When the Shivans burst back into alliance space, the Terrans and Vasudans are suddenly faced with war on two fronts. But the alliance has had a generation to prepare for the reappearance of the Shivans and has spent that time developing formidable weaponry. Has the alliance now surpassed the mysterious Shivans? What are the real motivations of the xenophobic, secessionist Terrans? Will the alliance discover a way to reestablish contact with Earth, which was lost after the events of the original game? The complex plot of FreeSpace 2 is often surprising and consistently captivating. <P> As in the original, the story unfolds in FreeSpace 2 through a combination of mission and command briefings, sporadic cutscenes, and, most effectively, through events depicted within actual missions. Gameplay in FreeSpace 2 will be very familiar to Freespace veterans, but there are several significant improvements. You\'ll still pilot fighters and bombers, but the capital ships in the game have been made considerably more dangerous. The cruisers and destroyers weren\'t exactly puny in the first game, but they\'re positively gigantic in FreeSpace 2, and unlike in many space sims, the capital ships are as deadly as their ominous size suggests. Almost all the capital ships in the game are now equipped with powerful beam weapons similar to those that were on the Shivan dreadnought, the Lucifer, in the original game. The main beam weapons are primarily used in battles between capital ships, but most of the larger ships are also stocked with smaller, anti-fighter beam weapons. Capital ships have been decked out in flak cannons as well, which let them make quick work of bombers and fighters foolish enough to wander in range. They are also still equipped with laser turrets and missile silos as in the original game, collectively making capital ships flying fortresses you\'ll learn to fear. <P> But best of all, the capital ships in FreeSpace 2 aren\'t relegated to being exotic targets for your bombing runs. Too often in space sims there\'s very little contact between opposing capital ships. However, in almost every FreeSpace 2 mission capital ships will end up clashing with each other, adding an epic feel to the overall conflict and the individual battles. It\'s highly entertaining just to sit back and watch these titans pound away at each other, ripping through each other with their tremendous beam weapons. FreeSpace 2 is the first space sim to depict epic capital-ship battles in a manner that both plausibly reflects their importance and demonstrates their raw power in an entertaining fashion. <P> It would be even less plausible if the Shivans, a race that has effectively stalked through galaxies for thousands of years, redesigned its forces every few years. Accordingly, almost all the Shivan ships encountered in the original game return in FreeSpace 2. But there\'s no shortage of new Shivan ships either, and their existence is easily justified on the basis that the Terrans and Vasudans only encountered a small portion of the Shivan forces in the original game. Ship design is just another example of how Volition has carefully crafted a believable and constantly engaging gameworld. <P> Another notable addition is the nebula in which you initially encounter the Shivans. The nebula is beautifully depicted and envelops the entire screen, limiting your line of sight and making navigation difficult. Certain areas of the nebula are subject to entertaining but harmless energy flashes, and other areas are prone to EMP pulses that completely disrupt your HUD. The graphics in Descent: Freespace garnered plenty of well-deserved accolades even though they were limited to 640x480 resolution and were consistently quite dark, but FreeSpace 2\'s graphics are fantastic. A new high-resolution 1024x768 option has been added, and 32-bit color depth is supported if you have a capable video card. The game requires 3D acceleration, but it\'s used to good effect to depict the nebula, beam weapons, flak bursts, and the most impressive explosions yet seen in a space sim. <P> Mission design is varied and almost uniformly excellent throughout the game. Objectives change in response to scripted events, and there\'s plenty of wingmen chatter to further develop the plot and give context to mission events. There are very few missions in the game that are as simple as the ""kill all the enemies you encounter"" type commonly encountered in space sims. There\'s almost always a twist or two in each mission, but the missions are beatable and almost never feel puzzle-like as they do in some other games with heavily scripted missions, such as Independence War. FreeSpace 2\'s campaign is linear, but rather than having to play each mission until you succeed, you can skip the ones you\'ve failed five times or more, which should appease gamers who are easily frustrated. <P> The game\'s interface is virtually unchanged from Descent: Freespace, but if there was ever an appropriate use for the clich ""if it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it,"" it\'s to describe Freespace\'s outstanding interface. Valuable information that is rarely displayed in space sims, such as the status of craft being escorted, is accessible at a glance. The HUD lets you instantly identify craft that are targeting your ship, the heading of missiles homing in on your ship, and your current target\'s relative orientation to your ship. The interface used by the Freespace games was clearly designed by experienced space-sim players, and as a result, it\'s just about perfect. As in the original game, the interface is also completely customizable, and you can even useyour own pilot picture for multiplayer opponents to grow to detest. And force-feedback joystick support gives afterburner thrusts a tangible feel and physically rebukes you for colliding with other craft. <P> While Descent: Freespace promised a plethora of multiplayer features, its multiplayer aspects didn\'t work well, at least not in the game\'s initial release. Online lag was a real problem, and Volition was exceedingly optimistic in contemplating 12-player conflicts. But lag is now handled much more effectively, making multiplayer battles a lot more fun, especially if you\'re fortunate enough to have a high-speed Internet connection. You can find plenty of games to join on the free Parallax Online servers, which also maintain comprehensive pilot statistics records. (Volition actually threw a couple of the pilots who had racked up the most impressive records with Descent: Freespace into one FreeSpace 2 campaign mission.) Even more interesting is the addition of Squad War, another free multiplayer service that lets squads of pilots conquer other squads\' territories, ultimately giving you the opportunity to dynamically change the gameworld in a way that massively multiplayer games have yet to permit. Finally, in addition to a lengthy campaign and the multiplayer options, FreeSpace 2 is also packaged with the latest edition of Volition\'s mission editor, which lets you craft and trade your own missions and campaigns. Very few games offer as much inherent value as FreeSpace 2. <P> All my complaints with the game are relatively minor. Wingmen and enemy AI have improved since Descent: Freespace, but they\'re still occasionally disappointing, as ships tend to collide with each other too frequently and then seem to become unable to accomplish their objectives. Capital-ship explosions aren\'t just eye candy and can be deadly to nearby fighters and bombers, but wingmen and enemies seem incapable of effectively dodging such effects. There\'s also no 800x600 resolution option, which will disappoint Voodoo2 owners in particular. If you don\'t have a powerful system and a capable video card, you\'ll have to play at 640x480 resolution, but even that resolution boasts graphics more impressive than those in Wing Commander: Prophecy or Descent: Freespace. The music and sound effects in FreeSpace 2 are both excellent, and 3D sound is well supported, although the game shipped with a bug in the A3D support. Fortunately, DirectSound can be chosen as a viable alternative. FreeSpace 2 is an outstanding game. It retains the outstanding customizability and interface of the original game and presents a more involving story and the best graphics seen in the genre to date. FreeSpace 2 also retains all the gameplay features that worked well in the original game and adds formidable new weapons, 32-bit color effects, and improved mission design. The inclusion of a variety of multiplayer options and a mission editor should also ensure that the game has plenty of longevity. Descent: Freespace was a solid game with the potential to be even greater, and that potential has been fully realized with FreeSpace 2. FreeSpace 2 is a true classic of the genre and one of the best games to be released this year.<I>--Desslock</I> <P> --<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Dark Delusion: Deception 3,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Most role-playing games cast you as a hero who enters dungeons and castles in search of treasure and who fights with monsters while avoiding traps. Tecmo's Deception trilogy, on the other hand, can be seen as something of a reverse RPG. Here, you wait for warriors and wizards to come to you and then try to catch them in your traps. As in Square's Final Fantasy series, the story in each new Deception has nothing to do with that of the last. In the first, you played as a man; the second, a woman; and the third, a woman again. Evil kings and nobles always come into play, and you kill them by setting your traps, acting as their bait, and springing your snares at the right moment. That's all the background that really needs to be covered, save for noting that the developers' fast and loose take on both translation and spelling make for many unintentional comedic moments.  While the Deception III recipe is largely the same as before, there have been several changes and improvements. This iteration introduces the option to create your own traps out of several elements: basics, emblems, rings, and orbs. The basics you can choose from include bear traps to snag an enemy's feet, spikes that shoot from the wall, and swinging bladed pendulums. Emblems give the traps additional strength in a handful of different ways, such as making them explosive or serving as electrical conduits. Rings are an extra layer that you can use to, say, reduce the time it takes for a trap to charge or to set a trap to go off automatically when someone trips it, while orbs are an expensive way to increase a device's overall power. Once a trap is made, you can even go back and add or subtract parts, although this costs money that you unfortunately don't recoup by breaking the device down.  There are also two new game modes: trap license and expert mode. The former is essentially a second training stage, while the latter requires you to accomplish a series of assignments such as performing a four-hit combo or earning 500 points in less than forty seconds. This may sound good and challenging on paper, but in practice it turns out clumsy and unrealized. If the traps you've earned don't suit a specific task in expert mode, you're simply out of luck, as you're not allowed a lot of room for experimentation. Need three devices to toss someone out of a room? If you didn't need to do this in the main game it's unlikely you'll have enough points to pay for the traps to do it now. Visually, Deception III looks almost exactly like Kagero: Deception II. It's obvious that the game uses the same engine as before, and not much has been done to alter or enhance it. The graphics are a little sharper, but the frame rate is still very slow, and the environments look eerily familiar. Sound is also close to nonexistent in the game, save for a few explosions. Since you don't need any audio clues to play Deception III, you're better served turning down the sound entirely, putting on your own music in the background, and imagining a really big boom every now and again. Sadly, only marginal improvements have been made to this latest Deception, making it feel more like a new iteration of a sports game than a full-fledged sequel. The second game in the series felt a little behind the times in terms of graphics and frame rate when it arrived last year, but its charm allowed you to look past that. It was, in every sense, a guilty pleasure. Deception III's use of the same engine, however, makes the game look and feel very dated now, and since the gameplay is basically just more of the same, the title gains no such allowances.  There is still some fun to be had with Deception III, and it's probably too severe to call it a bad game, per se, but without a doubt it lacks the spark and originality found in the two previous titles.  <I>--Joe Fielder </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

K-1 Grand Prix,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""Ostensibly, K-1 Grand Prix is the third title from Xing, but really it's the same game all over again. The beefed-up graphics and additional options in K-1 Revenge, the second game in the series, were enough to appease K-1 fans like this one once, but two times in a row just doesn't cut it. The cleaner character models and all of the new modes added to K-1 Grand Prix simply can't hide the fact that the game is just the same. You still can choose from several modes of play, including single player, tournament, and training. There is also a new career mode, which lets you create your own kickboxer; unfortunately, the creation system employed is terribly simple, and it doesn't offer much variety at all. The career mode lets you fight your way up from the bottom of the ranks in the hopes of being named champion. Along the way, you must pay your dues by going through tedious exercises so you can earn enough points to purchase moves, which you can use during a match. Of course you can still choose from 16 of the top kickboxers in the world, like Andy Hug, Musashi, and Ernesto Hoost. This game controls the same as the first two games: The D-pad moves your fighter toward and away from your opponent; the shoulder buttons[QUERY: let your fighter] sidestep, while the buttons on the face of the controller execute punches, kicks, and special attacks. If you press up or down on the D-pad while pressing an attack button you'll vary the height and/or type of attack. However, the actual speed that the game runs at is a great deal slower than that of the other K-1 titles, and this makes playing K-1 Grand Prix totally boring. Visually, K-1 Grand Prix is definitely an improvement over its predecessors. The game's frame rate is fast and runs quite smoothly. The character models have improved dramatically: No longer are the fighters blocky polygons strung together but instead are quite rounded, and they represent their real-life counterparts quite well. However, improved models can't hide the same old animations used for punches and kicks. The animations of the fighters performing various moves look very stiff and unrealistic. In the audio department, the sound effects are decent but not very authentic. The music in the game is good enough to get the job done but not much past that. Unfortunately, there's no cool quasi-rendition of Van Halen's Running With the Devil, as there was in the last K-1.  In the end, K-1 Grand Prix is for the most part the same as the original. Sure, the graphics are cleaner and the game has more options, but for anyone who has played the first two K-1 titles, the third isn't worth playing. If you haven't played any of the K-1 games, and you are curious about K-1 Grand Prix, you shouldn't be - the game's outdated engine and control scheme are inferior to just about any other fighting or boxing game released in the past year. If you just have to know for yourself, take my advice and play K-1 Revenge -  it was a bit faster and therefore more fun.  <i>--Ryan Mac Donald </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Listen to real commentary  from announcer Joey Styles while you annihilate your opponents. Among the  hardcore weapons you can choose are cheese graders, kendo-sticks, baseball bats,  shovels, and ladders.', 'Extreme Championship Wrestling is an east-coast-based wrestling organization that uses ""extreme"" wrestling matches as a way to distinguish itself from the slightly more kid-friendly WWF and WCW. Good ECW matches contain all sorts of mayhem that you\'d never see on a more straitlaced wrestling program, from people being tossed through mountains of tables, to barbed-wire matches. Any rules you might be used to from watching safer wrestling shows have been thrown out the window. ECW may not have the big names or the big budgets of a WWF or a WCW, but it\'s got many talented wrestlers and a unique and interesting product. Acclaim\'s ECW Hardcore Revolution, however, contains none of this. Remember Acclaim\'s last wrestling game, WWF Attitude? ECW Hardcore Revolution is, at its core, Attitude with different wrestlers and different sound effects, with a couple of new modes and moves (mostly finishers) tossed in to help make you forget that you\'ve already played this game. But with the game playing nearly identically to Attitude, it\'s impossible to shake the feeling that you\'ve played this game before. None of the ""extreme"" elements that made ECW as popular as it is are present. Any finisher that requires an object of any kind (Rob Van Dam\'s Vamdaminator, for instance) isn\'t in the game. You won\'t see anyone flying off the top rope out into the crowd area here. The only ""extreme"" differences between this game and Attitude is that this game plays slightly faster, it\'s easier to toss someone out of the ring, the language is a slightly dirtier, and there\'s a barbed wire match, which turns the ring ropes into some horrible-looking barbed wire. Trying to bounce off the wire makes you fall over in pain. For those of you unfamiliar with WWF Attitude, it uses a balanced gameplay system of grappling and reversals that keep players from relying on the same easy moves over and over again. Basically, you want to pull off a few easy moves, like punches, kicks, and other simple moves to swing the match\'s advantage in your favor. Once your advantage light is fully lit, it\'s significantly easier to execute grapple moves. If you don\'t have the advantage, harder moves will usually be blocked. As you wear your opponent\'s health bar down, you\'ll eventually be able to perform your wrestler\'s finishing move. ECW works in the exact same way, right down to identical life bars. Graphically, the game has been bumped a notch over Attitude. The characters are more colorful, as are the arenas. The sound is also good, though it\'s still chock-full of lame phrases from the crowd. The announcing seems more accurate, mostly because Joey Styles, the voice of ECW, works alone, so there\'s less speech to match up with the action. ECW Hardcore Revolution isn\'t a bad game, by itself. But it in no way represents the style of wrestling that the ECW uses, it has absolutely zero points going for it in the originality department, and the game comes off as a real slap in the face to the federation\'s hard-core fans. ECW and its fans deserve better than this. ECW\'s wrestling style isn\'t the same as the WWF\'s, and ECW\'s game shouldn\'t be like the WWF\'s, either. Plus, this is the third year that Acclaim has trotted out the same wrestling engine with a few slight tweaks. It\'s getting very old. Fans of ECW would be better served by waiting for Acclaim\'s next ECW game, which will use a new (and hopefully more accurate) engine.   <I>--Jeff Gerstmann </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

BattleTanx: Global Assault,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['USED: Play Station 1 BattleTanx Global Assault. Case is damaged, butgame is uaranteed to play. We do combine shipping, so be sure to checkout our other listings!* BRAND/SYSTEM = Playstation 1* CONDITION = Visible Wear: USED* GAME AGE RATING = T- Teen* GAME INCLUDES = Game w/ Case Only* AVAILABILITY = In Stock* SHIPS WITHIN = 1-2 DaysITEM ID: 141275CATEGORY: Playstation', ""It's strange to see BattleTanx come to the PlayStation, since it has always seemed as though 3DO started the series on the Nintendo 64 because there weren't any Twisted Metal-type games there. Now it's arrived on the PlayStation (where vehicle-based shooters run like wine) and without a four-player mode .... But it's not totally without merit. BattleTanx's storyline is a combination of the plots from at least several apocalyptic '70s sci-fi films and novels. In this latest edition (the first appeared only on the N64), you and your wife are safeguarding chieftains of a new civilization and have recently sired a child - a rarity in this future world, where most of the women have died due to a strange, if modestly generic, plague. One of the other world leaders, a madwoman who controls most of Europe, has discovered that your son has telepathic powers (known as The Edge) similar to her own, and she sets out to steal him from you before he develops fully. When her troops (they're all in tanks - everyone drives tanks in this game, just accept it) fail to kidnap him, she uses The Edge to take control of your forces, setting the three of you on the run. At that point you pop into your trusty tank and fight the good fight. Besides your main guns, there are secondary weapons and power-ups such as grenades, which you can throw into fortified areas or bounce around corners to destroy heavy gun emplacements; a plasma pulse that zooms around the screen until it finds a target; and a cloaking effect that renders you invisible after a Predator-style shimmer. And you're not the only one who gets to pick them up; you'll find that the enemy tanks use them frequently, perhaps to your chagrin, but it at least adds to the game's challenge. No doubt about it though, the best weapon you have in your arsenal is The Edge, which initially only stuns opponents within close range, but later it allies them with you, once your abilities have improved.  The game's life system is set up so that instead of having a set number of lives, you acquire tank bucks, which you use to buy different tanks. The basic Abrams tanks cost a standard amount of money, while the beefy Goliaths run more than twice as much, and the small quick rides run about half the price of the basic tank. How you want to spend your cash is up to you. There are also more tanks to choose from in the sequel - from the Inferno, which sports a flamethrower, to the Marksman, which equips a laser you can use to snipe from a distance. One thing that the PlayStation version of BattleTanx: Global Assault has over its N64 counterpart is more levels, although that's a bit of a mixed blessing. BattleTanx: GA on the N64 had almost twice as many levels as the original game, and they felt less cookie-cutter and offered more variety. You could play a few simple search-and-destroy missions back-to-back, but they'd be followed up by one in which you'd have to guard a convoy or free allies from a prison. However, these new PlayStation-specific levels feel like more of the same, which takes away from the entire game. The levels that had felt original on the N64 don't now, because there are three more like them here.  The tanks, weapons, and stages help out a lot throughout the game's multiplayer deathmatch variations, but you'll skip over many of them for the Battlelord stages, where you must steal opponents' queens and return them to your base, all the while defending your own matriarch. The two-player co-op mission, where you and a friend play the main game from a split-screen perspective, is BattleTanx: GA's main asset, even though the frame rate is a little jumpy.  While the graphics in BattleTanx: GA don't appear quite first-generation, they don't stack up to the graphics in similar games on the PlayStation such as Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8, all of which run at a much faster frame rate. The horizon is always enshrouded by a very lackluster fog effect; the game's explosions are wholly unimpressive; and the between-level introductions consist of simple text rundowns. The soundtrack is essentially the same as in the Nintendo 64 edition, which worked well enough for a cartridge-based game, but on a CD-based system, it's severely lacking.  Instead of playing to the PlayStation's abilities, this port tries to match the N64 version as much as it can, without improving the areas where it could exceed it. If you've really been looking forward to playing this game, you're much better off renting a Nintendo 64 and the N64 edition to see it done right.  <i>--Joe Fielder </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Sammy Sosa Softball Slam,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['In the copycat world of sports video games, it\'s unusual to find a game concept that\'s never been done before. So it\'s something of a wonder that the preferred sport of the bearded, pot-bellied, blue-collar American is just now making an entry into the video-game market. But even though the game may deserve some credit for originality, the sheer lack of quality throughout the game keeps Sammy Sosa\'s Softball Slam from being anything interesting. Sammy Sosa\'s Softball Slam makes an over-the-top arcade-style approach to softball, portraying it as the silly, somewhat outrageous ""sport"" it is. There are no professional players here - just beer-guzzling guys and well-endowed women out in the park for a little fun. The game does a good job of staying with this theme, as fielders will often flub catches, basemen will overthrow their bases, and runners will occasionally plow over the ball carriers. The gameplay is just about as simple as you could possibly get - when you\'re pitching you can choose from one of four pitches, and when you\'re batting you can choose from one of three swings. There are none of the complex ball-angling or pitch-prediction techniques found in most other baseball games on the market - just a simple single-button hit-the-ball-when-it\'s-over-the-plate technique that gets boring pretty quick. Once the ball is hit, the computer switches you to the nearest fielder and shows you exactly where the ball is going to land with a huge circular icon - stand anywhere underneath it, and you\'ve got a great chance of catching it. Tossing the ball to the bases is pretty intuitive, as Softball Slam uses the diamond button-for-a-base scheme so common in other baseball games. Still, playing the game really isn\'t that fun, as the overly simplistic nature gives you almost no control over your players. The addition of flaming homeruns and power throws - throws that light on fire and are faster but less accurate - really do nothing to help the gameplay. The first thing you\'ll notice about this game is just how ugly it is. Simply put, the graphics are way below par - not only is the animation of all the characters extremely choppy, but the textures and backgrounds are pathetic. There are almost no shading and lighting effects, and the characters look extremely polygonal. The backgrounds are both blurry and pixilated, and making out exactly what\'s going on while you\'re fielding is sometimes difficult. On top of that, your batters will often go into a practice animation or taunt in the middle of the pitch, only to suddenly jump into the swing animation when you press the button. This effect not only looks ridiculous, but it also makes it that much harder to judge the pitch. The sound is really bad too. Not only does the game feature an overobnoxious announcer who unsuccessfully tries to get you into the game by screaming things like ""It\'s wild! It\'s crazy!"" when you get a base hit, but the taunts from the stands are enough to make you go insane. You\'re guaranteed to hear ""Hey, your shoe\'s untied"" at least twice for every batter, making this game infinitely better without the soundtrack. There\'s no in-game music, and the ambient sound effects really make you wish they had put some sort of music in the game. While the game offers you the option of creating your own team, the options are extremely limited. When playing a coed league, you\'ll have to have an equal number of guys and gals on your team, and you won\'t be able to change their order. The options that it does give you are pretty ridiculous - you\'ll be able to change your players\' name, size, weight, and a few of their stats, but you won\'t be able to change their actual faces or hair color. The edit-player mode also features a ""transform to Sammy Sosa"" button, which, when pressed, transforms the character into Sosa as if he were some sort of fleshy Optimus Prime. Unfortunately, once you press the button you can\'t change back, meaning Sammy\'s now stuck on your team. Also, while the mode uses a point system to measure stats on each of the different players, it doesn\'t regulate your spending, meaning you can simply pump all the stats up to their max without giving it a second thought. All in all, the edit-team options are so limited and tedious that it\'s not really worth spending the time to use them. While it\'s nice that more arcade-styled takes on regular sports are showing up on consoles, Sammy Sosa\'s Softball Slam is a poor example of how games like this should be done. This game simply screams mediocrity, as almost every aspect of this game is substandard. While casual gamers might want to give this game a rental, those looking to experience a little softball action should simply go outside and do it the old-fashioned way.  <I>--Ben Stahl </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Mobile 1 Rally Championship,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Rally racing is characterized by its virile, bombastic nature, colored by hostile tracks and an emphasis on slides, grinding, and bullying one's way up the chain. It takes a certain type of individual to truly appreciate the sport's lusty, organic interpretation of the idea of racing four-wheeled mechanical constructs. A person thus inclined, and in addition, possessed by a particular devotion to rally racing, might just get into Mobil 1 Rally Championship.  Rally racing has yet to find a game that does it justice. Colin McRae Rally and EA's V-Rally 2, the titles that serve as benchmarks for the genre, bear their share of blemishes (the former more than the latter). Developed by HotGen and published by EA, Mobil 1 doesn't do much to further rally racing's cause, either. Rather, it adds yet another flawed take on the sport, which, though fun at moments, ultimately doesn't satisfy the sport's need for an adequate digital doppelganger.  Mobil 1 offers all the required play modes for a racing title: an arcade mode, a championship series, a set of time trials, and a two-player mode. The arcade mode, just as you'd expect, allows for a light, small-commitment experience. To proceed through the stages, you must accrue an average of two points (out of a possible four) per race. All of the game's customization options are available in the arcade mode, however simple, and must be altered after every race to best take advantage of the makeup of the tracks. The championship mode comes very close to re-creating the actual rally experience: Dividing the cars into four categories (the last of which becomes available upon winning the championship), championship mode sets you off on a total of six tournaments interspersed throughout the British Isles. Each rally is composed of six races, each with differing track and environmental conditions. With a total of 48 races, variety is something Mobil 1does not lack. And with the fourth vehicle class as an incentive, those so inclined will find themselves drawn to the game. The time trials, on the other hand, start off rather slow, as only the tracks you've braved in championship mode are open for a romp. Also, completion of the arcade mode lets you race through the time trials backward. The two-player mode lets you and a friend enjoy a truly liberated take on the sport, as it features six looping tracks native to the mode. While this isn't doesn't really accurately portray the soul of the sport, most people are in favor of forfeiting reality for a little enjoyment. If only the game were more pliable and less spastic, the game would have been a great deal of fun. Though Mobil 1 is not totally unplayable, certain factors often make it difficult to get into. First off, steering is totally temperamental, even for a rally game. And you will find little solace in the adjustable settings; finding that perfect zone between over- and understeering is quite impossible. The smallest deviations from the ultrathin tracks are punished by wild spinouts and paralyzing crashes.  Speaking of tracks, the race conditions, while truly disparate and never redundant, have effects on the cars' performance that seem extremely off-kilter. Racing on snow feels as if you're battling the influence of magnets placed on either end of the track, periodically pulling you in to their respective fields, making your race feel more like a woozy zigzag than an earthy romp through merciless terrain. Powerslides are governed by the same temperamental physics: Their being the cornerstone of rally racing makes this flaw hard to swallow. Often, a mistimed slide will stop you dead in your tracks, when it should have merely propelled you farther in your desired direction, albeit at your flanks. Also, going offtrack seriously tars down your vehicle. Sad, because the offtrack element is such a huge part of the sport.  At least Mobil 1 boasts a sharp visual production in its favor. The cars are excellently detailed, though the damage they incur looks a little flat and bland. The frame rate is passable - never really impressive, never staggeringly slow. The environments do well to re-create Britain's lush raceways, and they aren't possessed by too much annoying pop-up. Aesthetically, Mobil 1 is one of the sharper rally games out there.  Mobil 1's sound is for the most part bearable, though hardly remarkable. The effects are functional, if often a bit garbled and semidistorted. Engine sounds are particularly whiny, though I've learned to expect that from rally titles. The navigator's voice is often a tad unclear - truth be told, I'm not sure if it's the thick accent or the fuzzy nature of the whole audio production that's difficult to deal with, or a combination of both.  In terms of an overall package, EA's V-Rally 2 and Colin McRae have much more to offer than Mobil 1. Though neither offers a flawless interpretation of the sport, you're better off going with one of them, as Mobil 1's problematic controls and hyperactive physics model seriously compromise enjoyment of the game much of the time. Rally aficionados may find some respite in Colin McRae Rally's sequel, if and when it makes its way stateside.<i>--Miguel Lopez</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

ECW: Hardcore Revolution - Sega Dreamcast,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Introducing the wrestling game to end all games! ECW Hardcore Revolution packs a barbed wire punch that leaves you screaming for more! Three all-new monster arenas pack well over 20 ECW wrestling stars in all their bad-mouthed, brawlin' glory, including the Madhouse of the Extreme (NYC), ECW Arena (Philly), and Pay-Per-View Events! Feel the terror of being hit with a flying chair or snagged in a strip of razor sharp barbed wire at any given moment! Whether you create your own wrestler or Pay-Per-View event in any of the 20+ featured game modes, it's awesome, no-holds-barred hardcore gaming!"", 'Extreme Championship Wrestling is an East Coast-based wrestling organization that uses ""extreme"" wrestling matches as a way to distinguish itself from the slightly more kid-friendly WWF and WCW. Good ECW matches contain all sorts of mayhem that you\'d never see on a more straitlaced wrestling program - from people being tossed through mountains of tables, to barbed-wire matches. Any rules you might be used to from watching safer wrestling shows have been thrown out the window. ECW may not have the big names or the big budgets of a WWF or a WCW, but it\'s got many talented wrestlers and a unique, interesting product. Acclaim\'s ECW Hardcore Revolution, however, contains none of this. Remember Acclaim\'s last wrestling game, WWF Attitude? ECW Hardcore Revolution is, at its core, Attitude with different wrestlers and different sound effects, with a couple of new modes and moves (mostly finishers) tossed in to help make you forget that you\'ve already played this game. But because the the gameplay is nearly identical to Attitude, it\'s impossible to shake the feeling that you\'ve played this game before. None of the ""extreme"" elements that made ECW as popular as it is are present. Any finisher that requires an object of any kind (Rob Van Dam\'s Vamdaminator, for instance) isn\'t in the game. You won\'t see anyone flying off the top rope out into the crowd area here. The only ""extreme"" differences between this game and Attitude are that this game plays slightly faster, it has slightly cleaner graphics, it\'s easier to toss someone out of the ring, the language is slightly dirtier, and there\'s a barbed-wire match, in which the ring ropes turn into some horrible-looking barbed wire. Trying to bounce off the wire makes you fall over in pain. For those of you unfamiliar with WWF Attitude, it uses a balanced gameplay system of grappling and reversals that keep you from relying on the same easy moves over and over again. Basically, you want to pull off a few easy moves, including punches and kicks, to swing the match\'s advantage in your favor. Once your advantage light is fully lit, it\'s significantly easier to execute grapple moves. If you don\'t have the advantage, harder moves will usually be blocked or reversed by your opponent. As you wear your opponent\'s health bar down, you\'ll eventually be able to perform your wrestler\'s finishing move. ECW works in the exact same way, right down to identical life bars. Graphically, the game has been bumped a notch above Attitude. The characters are more colorful, as are the arenas. The sound is also good, though it\'s still chock-full of lame phrases from the crowd. The announcing seems more accurate, mostly because Joey Styles, the voice of ECW, works alone, so there\'s less speech to match up with the action. However, Joey occasionally refers to the wrestlers as ""player one"" and ""player two,"" which is a little annoying and pretty unnecessary unless you\'re playing as a created wrestler. ECW Hardcore Revolution isn\'t a bad game by itself. But it in no way represents the style of wrestling that the ECW uses. It has absolutely zero points going for it in the originality department, and the game comes off as a real slap in the face to the federation\'s hard-core fans. ECW and its fans deserve better than this cookie-cutter approach to game design. ECW\'s wrestling style isn\'t the same as the WWF\'s, and ECW\'s game shouldn\'t be like the WWF\'s either. Plus, this is the third year that Acclaim has trotted out the same wrestling engine with a few slight tweaks. It\'s getting very old. Fans of ECW would be better served by waiting for Acclaim\'s next ECW game, which will use a new (and hopefully more accurate) engine. <i>--Jeff Gerstmann </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

The game also features a new ""smart"" camera that captures the onscreen  action as if it were being broadcast on your TV set. Remote control, couch, and pizza not included.', ""Last year's release of High Heat 2000 exists as an example of one of the worst PlayStation sports titles ever released. Unlike its PC cousin, the PS version was visually offensive, sounded abhorrent, and lacked any semblance of decent stat keeping. Undaunted, 3DO is back with this year's update, Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001. With a year's worth of mistakes to learn from and the addition of Sammy Sosa's namesake, the 2001 release aims to offer baseball fans some modicum of redemption. As is true with every other console baseball title, you can choose from exhibition, season, home-run-derby, play-off, and player-editing modes. Do you want to create a seven-foot-tall power hitter and unleash him on the opposition? High Heat 2001 gives you the tools to do so, provided you don't mind replacing an existing major leaguer. Infamous to the High Heat series, family mode lets you play a quick game with the most forgiving of settings, making itself useful for those times when you have nonfanatic friends as your competition. Getting started is easy, the menus are concise, and the control interface is excellent. Depending on the simulation level you choose, batting, pitching, and fielding are tailored for various skill levels. On the lowest setting, a single swing sends the ball flying, and pitches require minimal effort in the presence of computer-assisted fielding. At the highest setting, pitching becomes a nightmare of angles and speed, batting requires painstaking precision, and fielding is nearly as difficult as the real thing. Though there are four levels of simulation, only the lowest and highest differ noticeably from one another. Regardless, High Heat 2001 offers precise control, responds quickly, and executes about ten times faster than last year's release. If there's any drawback to gameplay, it's not the controls or game mechanics but the lack of decent artificial intelligence. Without tricks, the game's four difficulty settings let you square off against a balanced computer opponent at your own skill level. Unfortunately, Team .366 left the game vulnerable to two of the oldest tricks in electronic baseball history, the low curve and the double-steal attempt. Regardless of difficulty level, the CPU will strike out time after time to curveballs low and away. Furthermore, if you get a man on first and a man on third, you can usually send them running and manipulate the CPU into giving you an extra base or an added run. Unless you're the type of person who can avoid such shortcuts, you'll be destroying the AI by 30 runs in no time. Visually, High Heat 2001 improves upon the previous release in hundreds of minor, albeit necessary, ways. Characters resemble human beings this year, and though they lack in polygons, they even animate with some level of realism. Stadium visuals, while remaining blocky, are also improved. Whether you play in Safeco Field, the Sky Dome, or the Ebbots Field of yore, at least the environs resemble their real-world counterparts. The polygon count is still a bit low, and the action does get blocky at times, but compared with last year's release, High Heat 2001 is beautiful. One has to wonder, though, why are the bases recessed into the field? It's silly to note that the developers couldn't spare an additional 20 or so polygons for realistically detailed bases, especially considering how wonderful the PC version looks. While Team .366 spent some time fixing the game's visual problems, the audio is still as sparse and uneventful as ever. Ted Robinson's play-by-play is repetitive and sleep inducing, sound effects lack enthusiasm, and the spectators drone on with a crescendo reminiscent of bad opera. Electronic Arts and 989 Studios can make baseball games that sound exciting, so there's no excuse for the bland audio that Sammy Sosa High Heat 2001 delivers. Although this game is not for everyone, it's safe to say that this year's High Heat will be a welcome addition to the game libraries of those who enjoyed last year's game. The gameplay is decent, many of last year's aggravating flaws are nowhere to be found, and the general feel of a baseball game is present. Unfortunately, the game's visual and audio quality remains far below what the competition offers, failing to bring about the same kudos that its PC counterpart is known for.  <I>--Frank Provo </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Armored Core: Master of Arena PS,,['2 disc'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Brand New and Sealed Sony Playstation 1 Game. Backed by a 45-day guarantee.', ""The third game in the Armored Core series follows in the footsteps of the second game - last year's Armored Core: Project Phantasma - in that it's more like an add-on pack than a new game in the line. Armored Core: Master of Arena provides new missions, arena opponents, and other assorted bits, but the interface, graphics, and overall feel are essentially the same.  If you haven't played an Armored Core game yet, there's some explaining to be done. You're a Raven, a mercenary pilot of a giant robot known as an armored core. You lend out your services to various companies and agencies that hire you for missions such as bodyguard work, search and destroy runs, or even the occasional rare-item retrieval. From there, you can use your earnings to buy additional parts to improve your mech, so you can do your job better, make more money, buy new parts, and so on. Areas of your robot that can be configured include the head, core, arms, legs, CPU, generator, back weapons, hand weapons, and special parts. A wide variety of items are available, allowing you to create a fairly distinct AC of your own. This customizability is one of the best things about the series. Beyond going on missions, the Ravens also like to compete against each other for top ranking within the organization. In a kind of future gladiator-style match-up, two mechs enter one of a number of disparate arenas, and only one leaves. To the victor goes prize money and occasionally an extra part; to the loser, nothing at all. These features remain in Armored Core: Master of Arena. In fact, the similarities between the last two games are overwhelming. The graphics are almost identical, which is unfortunate because they're looking more and more dated as time goes by. What once deserved an a score of eight a few years ago is now lucky to get a six because the visual standard has been raised, but none of the game's camera problems (your AC sometimes gets in the way of your view) have been fixed. The missions in AC:MOA are largely variations of earlier ones. In one, for example, you're parked on the top of a submarine and must fend off attackers from above. At one stage of AC: PP, you were parked on top of a helicarrier in the same way. This isn't to say that's bad, it's just more of the same. There are some fun and somewhat fresh new stages in AC:MOA - such as one where you attack a huge armored fortress - but they're exceptions. Many of the missions are pretty hard to accomplish, which makes one wonder how players who haven't imported ACs from previous games can survive them at all. Besides the missions, there are also several new, mostly well-designed arenas, new weapons and parts, and even PocketStation support, which lets you download your AC into the unit to compete against friends. Most distinct from previous AC games, though, is AC:MOA's multiplayer and configurable enemy options. First, its multiplayer mode is different from that of Armored Core: Project Phantasma. In AC: PP, two original copies were needed to compete in PlayStation Link Cable play. Armored Core: Master of Arena, however, comes with a second disc, making it a little easier to link up and fight. The second disc is also noteworthy because it offers a few more enemy mechs to battle, as well as the ability to create your own AC opponents, much the same way you've tooled together your own machine but with some basic AI levels to boot. It's a nice function, but it's not quite as cool as it sounds since you're limited to fighting one mech at a time. Even with these new elements, Armored Core: Master of Arena is really only recommended to die-hard fans of the line. It's much more of a stand-alone game than the last one was, but it's still not nearly the full-fledged sequel that it should be. The series could use a complete graphics overhaul, an update to the camera and controls, the ability to fight several mechs at once in an arena, and maybe even some bio-organic parts, just to mix things up a bit. People interested in checking out the Armored Core trilogy should start with the first game, which offers the same essential play you'll find here in a more comprehensive package. There's been no word on a US publisher yet for AC:MOA, but it wouldn't be a surprise if an Ascii, Crave, or Jaleco signed it up for late '99. Keep an eye on our news section for word.

A roster- management feature allows for multiplayer trades; creating, signing, and  releasing players; and calling up minor-league prospects. New York Yankees  broadcasters John Sterling and Michael Kay provide play-by-play and studio  commentary."", 'Go figure. On the system everyone counted out when it came to sports, Acclaim released the best console baseball title ever - All Star Baseball. Regardless of the lack of competition among N64 baseball titles, ASB proved that cartridge gaming did not preclude quality sports games. Not content to rest on their laurels, Acclaim and High Voltage are back this year with All Star Baseball 2001, and once again, it\'s not on the PlayStation or the Dreamcast but on the Nintendo 64. Similar to last year\'s title, the game offers a variety of arcade and simulation modes. For those hankering for the arcade experience, single-button pitches and swings are the norm, while realists can enable variable pitching and batting-simulation cursors. All Star Baseball 2001 also sees the return of the 3D batting-angle system, which, when coupled with the game\'s subtle pitch-guessing feature, gives the title the best control mechanics of any currently available baseball title. Fans of last year\'s stamina and hot/cold batting meters will rejoice at their return, and now there are also hot/cold pitching-effectiveness indicators. Overall, ASB 2001\'s offensive and defensive interfaces are a joy to experience, with intuitive control systems, quick response, and the feeling that you are indeed in control. Additionally, the pacing is spot-on, and the management interface is both stylish and simple, making for gameplay that will please both casual and hard-core sports fans. Featurewise, All Star Baseball 2001\'s offerings are standard fare, delivering season, exhibition, batting practice, and home-run-derby modes. There\'s also a moderate amount of freedom for player creation, trades, and team customization. It would have been nice if the game tracked an even greater abundance of stat categories, but considering ASB 2001 is second only to 989 Studios\' PlayStation game, MLB 2001, in terms of stat tracking, such a complaint is minor at best. Frankly, the fact that they fit all 30 teams, 35 stadiums, more than 700 players, and a smattering of Hall of Famers on a cartridge is amazing. Enhancing the gameplay, All Star Baseball 2001\'s visuals are crisp, clear, colorful, and full of depth. The polygon count for stadiums is high, allowing for advertising banners, scoreboards, and even the occasional diamond-vision screen. Furthermore, player models are realistically dimensioned and styled, animating in ways one would usually reserve for broadcast television. Since sky and outside visuals are made up of flat background images, there are times when the illusion of a 3D environment is broken, but compared with the PlayStation\'s offerings, this game\'s a masterwork. While ASB 2001 makes the most of the N64\'s graphical capabilities, the same can\'t be said for the game\'s sound quality. John Sterling and Michael Kay\'s play-by-play is exceptional but is devoid of variety. Furthermore, while the game contains announcements for most player names, there are many notable omissions. For example, veteran player Stan Javier, the Mariners\' center fielder, has no such player announcement. Adding insult to injury, crowd noise is minimal, and the various organ and interstitial music brings new meaning to the term ""chagrin."" Wise gamers take note: The sound menu lets you disable the more annoying sound categories. Regardless of sound issues, All Star Baseball 2001 is the best console baseball game, bar none. The visuals are photo-realistic, the gameplay itself borders on perfect, and the variety of game modes and multiplayer options offer high replay value. Furthermore, the game is just fun - and that, when all is said and done, is what counts the most.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Versus mode is a one- or two-player game that allows players to battle against each other or the computer. Tatsumi technodome mode allows players to unlock hidden features, including bonus movies, game music, character bios, and even karaoke!', 'A few years back, Capcom circumvented convention, or at least the company\'s own convention, and released a little niche game in the arcades called Cyberbots. Cyberbots was a game that went largely unheralded outside of Japan and, for one reason or another, it was only released for the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation in its native country. More recently, Capcom circumvented convention again and released a little niche game in the Japanese arcades called Kikaioh: Tech Romancer. Built on the PlayStation-based System 12 board, it is Capcom\'s second major attempt at bringing a giant-robot-fighting game to the masses. This time, however, it\'s in 3D, and the cast is entirely new. Much more of a port to the high-powered Dreamcast than Capcom\'s other 3D fighter, Star Gladiator 2, ever was, Tech Romancer is a combination of great graphics and solid fighting fun. If you\'ve ever gotten a kick out of watching giant-monster films, or you have had the fortune to see any number of Japanese children\'s shows (for example, Ultraman, Go Go Ranger, Kikiader, Mazinger Z, etc.), then you\'ll most likely dig Tech Romancer. While all the robots are Capcom ""originals,"" they obviously borrow from some of the most famous giant robots Japan ever offered. Evangelion, Gundam, the aforementioned Mazinger Z, Macross, and even Giant Robo have a neo-representative in attendance. If you have a favorite brand of ""real-life"" robot, chances are you\'ll find something to like here. Initially available are nine robots, with Kikaioh being the lead robot and others like Diana 17, Bolon, Twinzen V, and Wise Duck being some of the other bots. Of course, your first job is to pick one, but depending on which robot you pick, you may also have to select a pilot, who will determine special attacks and configurations. Once past the initial obligations, you\'ll discover a fighting game that feels like a traditional Capcom fighter but also plays like a 3D game. The main controls offer a block button, a jump button, and two attack buttons. Although this seems rather sparse at first, you\'ll soon discover the variations that make this one of the most enjoyable fighters in the last few years. Unlike Capcom\'s usual six-button layout, Tech Romancer uses all four Dreamcast buttons, as well as the shoulder triggers. You have a jump and a block button, as well as two attack buttons. The left and right shoulder buttons control, respectively, supermove selection and a side-step/attack move. The backgrounds are 3D, and they feature 3D polygonal buildings, which crumble under heavy fire. Power-ups can be found inside said structures, and when you pick them up (by simply walking over them), you can choose which enhancement to use by pulling the left trigger. Among the items you can pick up are repair boxes, offense up, defense up, hero mode, and power-ups that enable character-specific moves. The Y button performs most of your hand-to-hand moves, while the B button usually results in a long-distance attack, although some robots will launch an additional close-range attack. Various combinations of these buttons (for example, both attack buttons, block plus both attack buttons, both attack buttons plus jump, and others) will launch superdestructive supermoves that fill the screen with all sorts of special effects. Tech Romancer may be the first 3D fighter to have as many over-the-top superattacks as it does normal moves. While the full list of attacks and superattacks is both impressive and large enough to keep even the nimblest FAQ writer busy for weeks, it\'s the final attacks that offer the wildest visuals. After you\'ve drained an opponent of half his damage bar, you can execute a final attack - a move that, if successfully executed, will end the round in no uncertain terms. The downside is that the move is completely blockable or cancelable, and it must be timed right lest you leave yourself open to a counterattack. This can be useful for a comeback if you are close to dying, but you have managed to reduce your opponent\'s health enough to try a final attack.Bolon, the hodgepodge ball-shaped robot whose child-pilot is prone to bratty temper tantrums, can serve as a good example to describe a final attack. When you trigger her final attack, a large red curtain falls down and Pollin basically brings her opponent to a tea party. The antagonist always manages to insult Bolon/Pollin, who subsequently blows up the house of cards around them. Likewise, another of her lesser attacks shows Bolon throwing a minitrain and train track down to the ground. These items get underfoot and cause significant damage to the enemy. The attacks are wild and varied, and don\'t be surprised if your robot transforms, Veritech-fighter style. Other strategic moves - such as the power-break, which exposes turtlers to further attacks, and the steel-dash, which will also open up an opponent to a beating - are necessary to your survival. All of the robot designs are impressive, and they are considerably more memorable than Star Gladiator 2\'s palette swaps While playing Tech Romancer, you have two main options aside from the versus mode. Hero-challenge mode is a no-frills arcade mode that runs you through the gauntlet of robots, plus three bosses. The meat of the game is found in the story mode, which adds between-fight cinemas, multicharacter conversations, and even small animations. Each character also has his or her own individualized motif, designed to mirror different television shows. The character and robot you choose will determine which robots you encounter and, occasionally, which paths you choose between stages. Beating the game will also reward you in other ways, specifically in unlocking various hidden items. The graphics, originally modeled on the System 12 board, have been significantly improved. While not quite at the same level of Soul Calibur, they\'re certainly pumped up higher than the graphics in Star Gladiator 2. You\'d be hard-pressed to find a glitch or a moment of polygon seaming anywhere, even during dramatic close-ups or screen-filling superattacks. While most people won\'t have seen the original arcade version of Tech Romancer, it\'s no overstatement to say that these stellar robot designs benefit from the move to the Dreamcast hardware. Other sundry effects also give Tech Romancer that extra level of detail that separates the good from the great. Great lighting effects are present, as are subtle 3D elements such as a starfleet hovering close by in one stage. Craters are also left behind when grenades and rockets scorch the earth. Sadly, the backdrops are little more than flat 2D bitmaps, which aren\'t as detailed or high in resolution as they could have been, thus lending a dioramic feel to the game. The sounds in Tech Romancer are all crystal clear and full of punch, ranging from explosions to laser cannons to robot hydraulics to the voice actors\' quotes. Likewise, swords clashing, rocket-fists firing, and buildings crumbling all get the appropriate audio treatment. The music is classic Capcom, and if that\'s your thing, then you\'ll definitely enjoy the epic, yet cheesy, melodramatic Japanese action-show-style themes presented here. <I>--James Mielke </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Dragon Valor,,['Disc(s) plus hard plastic protective replacement case only. Disc condition ranges from flawless to scratched but is guaranteed to work.'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"[""<I>Dragon Valor</I> provides the narrative structure of role-playing games and combines it with the fighting action of adventure games. You'll take on the role of Clovis, the patriarch in a succession of Dragonslayer warriors. In the first chapter of the game, you'll battle in real-time combat through a fantastic world of powerful dragons and evil bosses. Power-ups along the way will make you an even more formidable hero, and you'll also benefit from spells you'll receive from defeated foes."", ""<I>Dragon Valor</I> also presents a number of possible love interests for Clovis. The hero of the game's second chapter will be the offspring of Clovis and whomever you choose as Clovis's mate. That hero must continue Clovis's fight against evil and, like Clovis, must choose a mate. The Dragonslayer mantle is handed down through four generations, with many possible heirs throughout."", ""Blending different genres into a single title often results in a refreshing game experience. In an industry where it sometimes seems like everything has been done, drawing from multiple established formulas is an easy way to provide something new. This is unfortunately not the case with Dragon Valor, the new role-playing-game-cum-street-brawler-cum-Zelda clone from Namco. Although it takes ideas from all of these genres and is indeed a solid game, Dragon Valor lacks the imaginative spark that sets games like Zelda apart from the teeming masses of unoriginality. Ostensibly, Dragon Valor is an adventure game, but playing it is like playing several games at once. Imagine putting Final Fight, Lunar, Crash Bandicoot and Zelda in a blender and hitting the puree button. The game presents a static overworld map that is navigated by selecting the move command and picking from a few preset locations (rarely more than two, often only one); this might give the impression of freedom, but the lack of choices really makes the game's progression very linear. When you arrive at each location, you begin a side-scrolling action sequence. Although the strikingly average graphics in these levels are 3D, the game allows only the slightest movement into the back- and foregrounds. Your character will encounter a number of enemies in these action scenes, and the combat is accomplished like a typical street-fighting game such as Final Fight or, more recently, Fighting Force. Always armed with the same mystical sword (we'll get to that later), your character bashes enemy after enemy using several different special attacks. Attacking an enemy with several button presses results in a combination of slashes and thrusts, just as in the typical street brawler. Dragon Valor extends the concept by giving you a variety of other moves to perform, such as aerial attacks and acrobatic evasions. Using these moves in the combat scenes is perhaps the most interesting aspect of the game, but the moves can't manage to relieve the tedium of most of the battle sequences. Dragon Valor provides you not only with a big sword and plenty of attacks but also with an RPG-style inventory and status screen in which you can manage the magic and items that you have acquired. The game's RPG elements are incredibly basic, however. The only stats represented numerically are strength and defense, and these are increased not by gaining experience (indeed, enemies provide no experience points when killed), but by picking up power-ups. The status screen also lets you select from a list of magic spells, which are gained by defeating certain boss-like enemies. These spells run the typical RPG gamut, from the elemental triumvirate fire/ice/lightning to the mainstay heal spell. Although the in-battle magic is a nice addition, it certainly doesn't add anything groundbreaking to the combat. The action in Dragon Valor is complemented by a variety of puzzles. The game could have really shined in this area, but the puzzles are generally uninspired rehashes of those seen in past Zelda games, from pushing boxes over switches to lighting torches for the purpose of illuminating an area. The game deserves small credit for including the magic spells in the puzzles' solutions, but the difficulty in finding the solutions doesn't match the brain-twisting complexity of Zelda 64, the game from which Dragon Valor seems to have drawn the majority of its inspiration. Dragon Valor's banal gameplay could be forgiven if its story were fresh and interesting, but alas, it suffers from the same unoriginality. You begin the game as the average boy (in this case Clovis), whose town is attacked by a rampaging dragon. After Clovis watches his sister die, the fallen hero bequeaths the sword to Clovis, who then embarks on a quest for revenge. Perhaps the only interesting part of Dragon Valor's story is that Clovis can meet more than one girl during this first chapter of his adventure (maybe dating simulation should be added to the list of genres the game draws from), and the offspring from this apparently random coupling will be the hero for Chapter 2. That child then begets the hero of Chapter 3, and so on. This makes little more than graphical and narrative difference, however, as each hero wields the same sword and uses the same moves as Clovis. Even stats and items are carried over from one chapter to the next, despite the supposedly lengthy progression of time. Different heroes experience different levels, however. Although Dragon Valor stands on its own as a fairly solid game, and there's nothing necessarily bad about it, the game just isn't particularly noteworthy. The average graphics, sound, and play mechanics contribute to the feeling that all this has been done before, and the uninspired storyline and lack of real plot twists really doesn't give you much motivation to keep playing. The branching family tree adds a measure of replay value, but the game is average enough that few will want to play it through more than once.  <I>--Brad Shoemaker </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

All those superlatives and more apply to <I>Motocross Madness 2</I>, the sequel to one of the most fun (if not the most realistic) motocross simulations ever created.', ""This sequel improves on the original by offering larger racing environments, more modes of play, and much more detailed graphics. The environments now have a full complement of trees, cacti, bushes, and other solid objects to smack into, and some game modes even introduce highway traffic into the mix. There's nothing like jumping over a moving semi on your way to the finish line! The new Pro Circuit career mode adds a lot of replayability (and long-term strategy) to the game, and fun multiplayer modes like tag offer a refreshing break to standard racing when playing online."", ""On the downside, all the new graphical goodness requires some serious computer hardware. While a 3-D accelerator isn't required, that's a little like saying your car doesn't need an engine because you can still push it. With a decent 3-D card, at least a 350 MHz processor, and plenty of RAM, however, the game really comes to life. Those of you with 3-D audio cards are also in for a treat, as it becomes possible to tell where other riders are just by listening."", ""It took some time to get used to <I>Motocross Madness 2</I>'s completely over-the-top physics.

Diablo 2: Collector's Edition,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['In <i>Diablo II,</i> players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players will explore the world of <i>Diablo II,</i> journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. The Collectors Edition includes the four-CD game, a 24-minute <i>Diablo II</i> movie on DVD and in letter-box format, the 70-minute soundtrack, and the D&amp;D <i>Diablo II</i> pen-and-paper box set for playing D&amp;D in the <i>Diablo II</i> setting.', 'Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed.', 'Diablo, lord of terror, and youngest of the three prime evils, awoke from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo took control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo gripped the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia.', ""Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric fell under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arose to challenge the darkness that had engulfed the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronted the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit could never be truly destroyed, the hero made the noblest sacrifice of all: casting his soul and his very sanity aside, the hero took the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will could contain the demon within. The hero could never have known that his selfless act would not only ensure Diablo's victory, but would also irrevocably damn his soul for all time."", ""Several changes have been made in the general gameplay of Diablo. The first thing you'll notice is the new interface. The familiar balls of health and mana frame the interface, but now more of the screen is devoted to the game. The text window in the middle of the screen is gone. Now, dialogue from NPCs appears over the respective NPC's head, and item descriptions and text also appear over objects."", 'Another new addition is the stamina bar. One big gameplay change is the ability to run. Now, you can run, but only for limited durations. When you do run, the stamina bar slowly depletes. When it runs out, you need to rest until it starts to fill up again. There will be items and spells that increase your stamina, but running will always be a limited ability. Although running obviously allows you to travel faster, it will leave you more vulnerable to attack, although you can go from run to attack seamlessly, as there is no pause between the two actions.', 'Moving around in Diablo has been improved in other ways as well. To cut down on the tediousness of walking back and forth between cleared-out areas and town, Blizzard North has added waypoints to the game.', ""However, these aren't waypoints in the real-time strategy sense. These waypoints are more like teleportation spots, quick portals between two or more locations in the same act. Each town has a waypoint, and various locations around the wilderness also have waypoints. You won't be able to use a waypoint until you've actually visited it once, and you won't be able to jump through it until you have touched at least two, since this is not a one-way travel system to explore the map. Instead, it's a convenience for moving about already explored areas."", ""The actual development of your character is also different. You now purchase skills via skill points each time you advance a level. In addition, the skill sets of each character are really differentiated, so that the abilities of the characters do not overlap. One other note about character development is that dying causes you to lose experience points. The designers wanted to make death something you would want to avoid even more , so they added experience loss in addition to equipment loss. However, you'll never lose enough experience to drop a level."", 'Not only is development different, but the classes are different as well. There are now five characters to choose from when you play: amazon, barbarian, necromancer, paladin, and sorceress. Each has his or her own strengths and weaknesses, although all should be very different and enjoyable to play. One of the key reasons why Diablo II looks like it will have immense replay value is because of the great differences between classes.', 'Amazon: A good all-around class with some spell use and special physical attacks. She is best with the bow, but also good with the spear and javelin, excelling in long-range attacks.', 'Barbarian: A powerful brute bereft of magic but possessed of potent combat skills. He is the only character that can wield two weapons at once; and this ability is available from level one!', 'Necromancer: A weak character who can command undead minions to aid him. His spells let him animate the dead and enhance their strength. He has some offensive magic.', 'Paladin: This warrior is second in physical strength and the best defensive fighter. He has healing and defensive spells to go with his powerful melee attacks.', 'Sorceress: She is also a weak fighter but possesses the most powerful magic arsenal, complete with fire, cold, and lightning spells.', 'The new trading menu is a big improvement over Diablo, where you had to dump your items on the ground and hope the other player paid you. Now, when you click on another player, you are requesting a trade. If he agrees, a trading window pops up, where you can place your items for trade and he can place his compensation. You both click when you are ready to finalize the transaction. It is not unlike the trading window for EverQuest.', ""Another new feature we noticed but that took us a while to comprehend was the socket items. You'll find weapons, shields, and helms in the game that have sockets in them. You'll also find gems in rare instances in caves and off of dead monsters' bodies. These gems can be placed in the sockets to convey special powers in the items, like the Materia system in Final Fantasy VII. A topaz, for instance, adds lightning damage if you place it in a weapon, but adds lightning resistance if you put it in armor. In our short time playing, we've already seen several different gems, including sapphires, emeralds, diamonds, and jeweled skulls. This adds yet another element to the already rich plethora of items you can find in the game. <br />--<i>Copyright 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.
