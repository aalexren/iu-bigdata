The expansive story of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, created under direction from George Lucas, is set during the largely unexplored era between Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. In Star Wars: The Force Unleashed , players assist Darth Vader in his quest to rid the universe of Jedi - and face decisions that could change the course of their destiny. As its name implies, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed completely re-imagines the scope and scale of the Force by taking full advantage of newly developed technologies: Digital Molecular Matter (DMM) and Euphoria. Paired with the powerful Havok Physics system, these new technologies create gameplay only possible on the new generation of consoles. DMM incorporates the physical properties of anything in the environment of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed so that everything reacts exactly like it should; wood breaks like wood, glass shatters like glass, plants on the planet Felucia bend like plants on the planet Felucia would, and more. Meanwhile, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed's revolutionary behavioral-simulation engine, Euphoria, enables characters in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed to move, act and even think like actual human beings, adapting their behavior during gameplay on the fly and resulting in a different payoff every single time you play Star Wars: The Force Unleashed.""]",Disney Interactive,"['>#26,994 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#969 in Video Games > PlayStation 3 > Games']",$74.99,Video Games,B00EY3F8L0

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet\'s huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist\'s salvation or their end? Discover their fate in <i>Borderlands</i>. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> As in a traditional RPG, <i>Borderlands</i> is built around the continual leveling of characters as they delve into quests. These quests include both story-driven adventures and side quests that offer players rewards such as items exclusive to quest completion and/or forward movement of the story.

A group of 12 have had enough and initiate a terror ultimatum called the Blacklist - a deadly countdown of escalating terrorist attacks on U.S. interests. Sam Fisher is the leader of the newly formed 4th Echelon unit: a clandestine unit that answers solely to the President of the United States. Sam and his team must hunt down these terrorists by any means necessary, and stop the Blacklist countdown before it reaches zero.', '<strong>Operate without Restrictions</strong><br> Sam is back in his tactical suit and goggles, and hes more deadly than ever. He is the only secret operative with the power to act above the law, and uses ruthless methods to interrogate enemies in order to extract crucial information that will prevent the next Blacklist attack. Pursuing the terrorists to the far reaches of the world, Sam flies from exotic locales to U.S. cities as he races against the clock to find out whos behind the Blacklist. Thrilling gameplay is enhanced by full motion performance capture, creating a highly cinematic experience. <br><br> <strong>Kill in Motion</strong><br> Always one step ahead, Killing In Motion lets Sam strike with lethal precision by marking and executing multiple enemies in one fluid motion. Active Sprint allows him to traverse the environment easily and fluidly, climb walls and leap over barriers in order to reach his next target while on the move.<br><br> <strong>Unleash the power of 4th Echelon Prototypes</strong><br> Splinter Cell Blacklist innovates from the roots of the franchise, and players can enjoy a series of twists on franchise favorites including reinvented classic weapons. Infiltrate terrorist cells by using new gadgets such as the upgraded snake cam and micro-trirotor drone which allows Sam to scout ahead, mark targets remotely, distract enemies, or explode with frag grenade force. Splinter Cell Blacklist is also bringing back fan-favorites like the sticky shocker, and for close quarters combat, players can wield the curved and brutal Karambit knife.<br><br> <strong>Build a New Echelon</strong><br> With a mandate directly from the President, Sam is building a whole new Echelon unit; his team, his way. Anna Grim Grimsdottir is his technical operations manager, CIA operative Isaac Briggs brings additional firepower, and resident hacker Charlie Cole rounds out his support crew. 4th Echelon is a fully mobile ops unit with unlimited resources and cutting edge technology aboard the repurposed stealth airliner, the Paladin.<br><br> <strong>Enjoy a Fully Integrated Experience</strong><br> Sam and his team are aware of terrorist attacks in real time thanks to the Strategic Mission Interface (SMI). The SMI allows the team to receive data about mission objectives while on the move. Players can earn money for completing missions and objectives and buy upgraded weapons and items from the SMI hub aboard the Paladin.']","by

The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone.

This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer.

You can effectively test your mettle without compromise, but also have the option to lower the difficulty.', ""Mimicking the adjustability commonly found on race-prepared coilover suspension, the pedals' spring force and travel both conform to individual preferences. The pedals' spacing can be set to nine different lateral positions, and they're also height adjustable to offer a choice of upright or reclined configurations. And, the pedal frame introduces the sensation of footwell limits, replicating the unique perspective of pro racers. Ergonomic adjustability doesn't stop with the pedals. Set the steering wheel's rake angle to one of four settings &#x2013; ranging from zero to 15 degrees &#x2013; with the included Allen key."", ""Genuine suede leather covers the aluminum steering wheel. The aluminum-faced pedals employ non-contact, position-sensing technology to increase longevity and reliability. Twin paddles promote instant gear shifting and are made of solid aluminum. Durable metal and strong ABS plastics impart the feeling of quality and craftsmanship, while high-precision internal components &#x2013; like the wheel shaft's dual roller bearings &#x2013; boost racing efficiency."", 'For a completely stable response, attach the wheel to your table or desk with the included clamps. And when driving from the comfort of your couch, detachable lap rests keep the wheel securely nestled in your lap.', ""Two facets of the wheel are primed and ready for potential updates farther down the road. The wheel face, mounted on a removable boss, easily detaches from the shaft to allow uncomplicated swapping. The internal computer chip's firmware is also upgradable via USB connection to a PC."", ""Taking a decisive step beyond commonplace installations, the Mad Catz Pro Racing Force Feedback Wheel and Pedals system easily integrates into Playseat's Revolution* and Evolution* gaming seats. Providing the means for the ultimate home-racing rig, you benefit from uncompromising performance coupled with striking aesthetics."", '<small>* Each sold separately</small>']","by

From rolling boulders and spiked walls to spring boards, iron maidens, human cannons, falling bathtubs and banana peels, the player can choose from a multitude of dramatic, sadistic, and comical traps in order to finish off an enemy. However, simply setting traps is not enough, as they need to be activated in turn. Timing also plays an important role, as an untimely activation could result in Laegrinna falling into her own trap or allowing her rivals to catch her. Depending on the manner in which an enemy is killed or captured, the Devil's three servants - Veruza, Caelea and Lilia (each representing a different aspect of cruelty: Sadistic Torment, Elaborate Death and Humiliating Demise) - reward points and upgraded traps.""]","by
