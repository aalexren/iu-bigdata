The Sims Medieval [Instant Access],,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<div class=""aplus"">', '<em>The Sims Medieval</em> is a brand-new direction for the popular single player Simulation game franchise, as the familiar gameplay mechanics of <em>The Sims</em> are blended with light Role-Playing (RPG) elements in a Medieval European setting. In this new incarnation PC and Mac players must both assure the happiness of their Sims on a day-to-day level, as well as support the aims of the kingdom they build and engage in all manner of quests which Sims can take on singularly and in groups up to three. New features include: a wide range of available Sims hero types associated with buildings constructed, each with a fatal flaw to overcome; a leveling system for characters based in replayable quests; and an overall player-chosen goal for kingdoms.', '<em>The Sims Medieval</em> takes <em>The Sims</em> franchise into the Middle Ages with all new features, new graphics and new ways to play. For the first time, players can create heroes, venture on quests, and build up a kingdom all their own. In an ancient land of adventure, drama and romance, players will be able to get medieval like nobody could ever have imagined.', 'As with all <em>The Sims</em> games, <em>The Sims Medieval</em> is primarily a Simulation game where the player is responsible for all aspects of their sims\' lives. But <em>The Sims Medieval</em> expands on the classic <em>The Sims</em> gameplay formula by affecting the focus of players and their Sims via a change of environment and game mechanics. The game adopts a ""what if"" scenario, placing your sims in a Medieval setting, complete with castles, monarchs, knights, peasants, intrigue between kingdoms, etc. Thus the question is: What if a <em>The Sims</em> game was set in a Medieval European time period? The answer to this is that although the player must still be very concerned about the day to day happiness, or unhappiness, of their Sims, there are also other concerns appropriate to the time period, or at least the game\'s interpretation of the time period. This equates to the three-tiered approach to gameplay centered around: kingdom, heroes and quests.', ""Life in the kingdoms of <em>The Sims Medieval</em> revolve around castles and the other buildings and facilities that are added to a kingdom. As a kingdom is established players codify the overall ambition of their kingdom. These ambitions can reflect a variety of concerns, including political, military, economic, etc. and will serve as a sort of mission statement for everything that transpires among the Sims that populate a kingdom. In the end this initial decision affects both Sim happiness and the overall fate of your kingdom. With each building that is added during the game players gain access to specific hero character types associated with them. These range from lofty roles like rulers, knights and wizards, all the way to the more humble physicians, craftsmen, etc. These different types of Sims can be customized in ways familiar to players of earlier games, including apparel and temperament, as well as the new fatal flaw customization, which must be worked out if players choose to work towards their sims prospering. The cumulative experience of this customization makes up the building blocks of a Sim's day-to-day experience, actions in the kingdom and happiness. Once the player's Sims are established, the game opens up into an additional crucial gameplay area, quests."", 'Quests in <em>The Sims Medieval</em> contains a certain level of role-playing game mechanics, which is new to <em>The Sims</em> franchise, and which offers players the opportunity to earn skill points, experience points and kingdom points. Following standard RPG game mechanics, points allow for leveling up of Sims characters and kingdoms. Thus, quests are also a crucial element of the game that drives the story of the game forward, depending on their success or failure, the temperaments of the participating Sims and the goals of the kingdom. Simple quests can be taken on by a single Sim while more complex endeavors can require up to three Sim heroes. All quests contain multiple paths towards completion, which are further varied by the fact of the differing strengths and weakness of your chosen heroes. This type of flexibility in quests allows for maximum replay value of the game, as the outcome of quests can vary widely depending on the Sim heroes utilized.', '', '<h4>System Requirements:</h4>', '<b>Windows</b>', '<b>Mac</b>', '<small>INTERNET CONNECTION, ONLINE AUTHENTICATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT REQUIRED TO PLAY.

This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise&rsquo;s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.', 'Ten years after a devastating mass event, America&rsquo;s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever.

A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative.

In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.', 'Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he&rsquo;ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.', 'A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling.

The next-generation of fighting has been built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and XBOX ONE by the team behind the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise. <br /><br />Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, <strong>EA SPORTS UFC</strong> brings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible. The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game. <br /><br /><strong>Feel the Fight &ndash; Gameplay Features </strong><br />Step into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight. <br /><br />&bull; <strong>MMAi </strong>&ndash; A mixed martial artist&rsquo;s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight. <br /><br />&bull; <strong>Full Body Deformation </strong>&ndash; Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter&rsquo;s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression. <br /><br />&bull; <strong>Real-Time Exertion</strong> &ndash; A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world. <br /><br />&bull; <strong>Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations</strong> &ndash; EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon. <br /><br />&bull;<strong> Precision Movement</strong> &ndash; MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns. <br /><strong><br />&bull; Dynamic Striking</strong> &ndash; A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight. <br /><br />&bull; <strong>Strategic Submission Battles</strong> &ndash; To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat.

Call of Duty(R): Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty(R) franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise\'s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms. Single Player Campaign Ten years after a devastating mass event, America\'s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what\'s left of the nation\'s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as ""Ghosts"" leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty(R) before. Multiplayer In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don\'t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty(R) game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles. Squads Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates.

Harnessing the power of Daybreak Game\'s next  generation Forgelight&#x2122; engine, in PlanetSide 2 battles persist when  thousands of players align with one of three unique Empires in intense  land, air and vehicle gameplay. In PlanetSide 2, the fight for territory  is more than a victory, it&#x2019;s survival. <br /> <br /> Across the continents of Auraxis, thousands of players come together  in enormous battles to win control of critical territories and key  resources for their Empire. With an extensive skill tree and free-form  class-based system, players are able to customize their soldier, weapons  and vehicles to match their play-style, as well as the needs of their  squad, outfit or Empire. Battles can last for days or weeks, so players  need to build alliances and specialized combat outfits to take on  long-term strategic and tactical initiatives. With aircraft and ground  vehicles, as well as infantry combat, the battles are larger and more  intense than ever before.<br /><br /><strong>Key Features:</strong><br /><br /> <strong>THREE EMPIRES</strong>: Players will have their choice to join three different empires:  <br /> <ul><li><em>Terran Republic</em> &#x2013; Like a militaristic government, the Terran Republic uses its Imperial authoritarian might to impel humanity to peaceful coexistence through any means necessary. <br /></li><li><em>New Conglomerate &#x2013; </em>A loosely connected group of rebel factions and idealistic freedom fighters, the New Conglomerate fight against the hegemony of the Terran Republic and the fanatical alien influence of the Vanu Sovereignty. <br /></li><li><em>Vanu Sovereignty</em> &#x2013; A technocratic Empire that believes humanity can only evolve by rediscovering and tapping into the lost technology of an ancient alien race. </li></ul><br /><strong>MASSIVE WARFARE</strong>: Battles take place not between dozens of troops, but thousands; with air and ground vehicles slugging it out alongside squads of troops. Whether in open fields, tightly-packed urban centers or enormous structures, victory requires strategic teamwork and a quick trigger finger to survive the massive battles.<br /><br /><strong>BATTLE FOR TERRITORIES & RESOURCES</strong>: The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding key territories and controlling resources. Each battleground holds valuable resources and key positions, and the Empire that can conquer (and manage to hold) these territories are rewarded with fuel bonuses, ammo bonuses, tech bonuses, and more.<br /><strong><br />PERSISTENCE</strong>: In PlanetSide 2 battles last for days or even weeks, and finally taking control of the base means it&#x2019;s yours until someone can take it back. Working strategically as a team to capture key tactical positions such as power plants and ammo depots have long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.<br /><strong><br />METAGAME</strong>: Large scale, persistent and coordinated effort required by hundreds of players working together to accomplish continental domination.<br /><br /><strong>ENORMOUS MAPS</strong>: PlanetSide 2 features incredible continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space; every inch of which is hand-crafted, contestable space. With the new territorial control meta-game, landmass has intrinsic value.<br /><br /><strong>CLASS-BASED COMBAT</strong>: Players are able to build their soldier to match their play-style, or to match the needs of their squad, outfit or Empire. With 6 distinct classes, each combat role, vehicle and weapon has extensive certification skill trees. These cert trees allow players to grow characters laterally, unlocking weapons, attachments, equipment, specialized skills, and more.<br /><br /><strong>OUTFIT TEAMWORK</strong>: Outfits (guilds) have access to unique customizations&#x2013; allowing outfits to have their own identity, reputation and role in the ongoing war.<br /><br /><strong>VEHICLES & WEAPONS</strong>: Players are able to access a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized for player preference or purposed with unique attachments and add-ons earned in game to fit each player&#x2019;s style.<br /><br /><strong>BUSINESS MODEL</strong>: PlanetSide 2 is Free-To-Play with an additional in-game RMT marketplace with Items that range from cosmetic camouflage patterns and armor paint jobs, to things like XP accelerators. Items that affect gameplay, such as weapon side-grades will be purchasable via resources earned in-game through gameplay and achievements.<br /><br /><strong>VOICE INTEGRATION</strong>: Players are able to communicate with their squads both through keyboard and voice chat. <br /> <br /><strong>System Requirements:</strong> <ul><li>Supported OS: Windows XP   Windows Vista   Windows 7</li><li>Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E6850 or higher / AMD Phenom II X2 or higher</li><li>RAM: 4 GB</li><li>Hard Disk: 15 GB</li><li>Video Card: nVidia GeForce 8600 series or higher / AMD or ATI 4850 series or higher<br />&#xa0;&#xa0;</li></ul></div></div><br /><div><table><tr><th style=""text-align:left;"" colspan=""2""><b>System Requirements:</b></th></tr><tr><td>Processor:&#xa0;&#xa0;</td><td>Core i5-760 or better / AMD Phenom II X4 or better [Quad Core CPU]</td></tr><tr><td>RAM:&#xa0;&#xa0;</td><td>6 GB</td></tr><tr><td>Hard Disk:&#xa0;&#xa0;</td><td>20 GB</td></tr></table></div><br /><div><table><tr><th style=""text-align:left;"" colspan=""2""><b>Recommended System Requirements:</b></th></tr><tr><td>Recommended Processor:&#xa0;&#xa0;</td><td>Intel i7 processor or higher / AMD Phenom II X6 or higher</td></tr><tr><td>Recommended RAM:&#xa0;&#xa0;</td><td>6 GB</td></tr><tr><td>Recommended Hard Disk:&#xa0;&#xa0;</td><td>20 GB</td></tr></table></div>']","by

It is that aspect of the XCOM universe that we wanted to explore, and offer to the fans. &#x2013; Morgan Gray', '<b>2.\tAre they trying to maintain similar themes (Enemy Unknown had a very high-tech feel)?</b>', 'What we share in common with all XCOM games is our emphasis on gameplay focused on smart tactical team work against a technologically and  numerically superior foe. We also focus on the concept of starting off with real world conditions (in our case in the 60s) and through the course of the game gaining access to higher tech, more amazing tools/gear/weapons so that at the end  of the game, not only is the player victorious over the aliens, but XCOM itself has grown to be on par with them in terms of technology. We are hi-tech, but in an Apollo13/Right Stuff kind of way as we are a period story. &#x2013; Morgan Gray', '<b>3.\tHave they had to make adjustments for the change in era?</b>', 'When the story of the game shifted from the 1950s to the early 1960s, it opened up a lot of opportunities to illustrate the incredible technology and aesthetics of that era.  The US was left with its pants down with the launch of Sputnik in the late 50s.  By 1962, the space race in the US was reaching a fever pitch.  Innovation and technology development was moving at a phenomenal rate. We wanted to bring some that amazing technology and vibe to The Bureau.  The XCOM base itself was heavily influenced by the Mercury era NASA space program &#x2013; evidenced most in the huge screen and rows of period computers in XCOM Operations.  We also fashioned vehicles and flight gear off of what was seen in the Skunk Works test pilot program.', 'On the civilian side of things, offices took on the sleek, straight lined look of the 60s popularized in the television show Mad Man.  Out in the world, we pushed the look from the curves of the 50s to the straight lines and geometric forms evidenced by the mid-century modern Googie movement.  The affected everything from vehicles to buildings and signage.  The overall feel produced a feeling that was much more space age and overall much more befitting an XCOM game. &#x2013; Jeff Weir', '<b>4.\tWhat makes the XCOM art style unique?</b>', '<b>5.\tWill the music in the new game be created by the same composer as Enemy Unknown?</b>', 'No, but from the beginning, I wanted the music of The Bureau to match the era and vibe we were trying to establish with the art and narrative.  I wanted it to have that 60&#x2019;s FBI gangbusters feel since that is essentially the kind of people that you are playing, interacting with, and leading into battle.  But I also wanted the score to be akin to the sci-fi films of the 50s and 60s.  The two movie scores that really fit what I was looking for were both by the great film composer Jerry Goldsmith.  The first was for the 1950&#x2019;s based L.A. Confidential and the other was the original 1968 version of Planet of the Apes. Given the style of these two scores, I knew what I wanted was right in the wheel-house of Garry Schyman who had done such an excellent job on the Bioshock games. Garry and I worked out the main themes for the score and then Garry delivered an incredible score for us.   He produced almost 80 minutes of music for The Bureau which was recorded at the Clint Eastwood stage on the Warner Brothers lot in Hollywood. I feel the score really gives The Bureau a unique identity and I feel it really sets the tone of the world that we are trying to have the player experience. &#x2013; Michael Kamper, Audio Director.']","by

With 90 percent larger screens than the 3DS, 3DS XL is the ultimate 3D entertainment system.', 'Nintendo 3DS XL includes two screens. The bottom touch screen makes use of a stylus that is stored in the unit itself. The top screen displays 3D visuals to the naked eye. Looking at the screen is like peering through a window into a world where characters and objects have true depth. The system also has a 3D Depth Slider that lets players select the level of 3D they enjoy the most. The 3D effect can be ratcheted up to the highest level, scaled back to a more moderate setting or even turned off completely, depending on the preference of the user.', 'The Nintendo 3DS XL system opens up a whole new world of eye-popping gameplay possibilities. The stereoscopic 3D display of the upper screen gives objects within the game world a feeling of space and depth that extends far into the back of the screen. It becomes easier to see the position of characters and obstacles in the world, making many game experiences even more intuitive for all types of players.', 'A built-in 3D Depth Slider allows you to immediately adjust the intensity of the 3D settings on the Nintendo 3DS XL system to your liking. The 3D effect can also be turned down completely &ndash; all Nintendo 3DS games and applications can be played in 2D, and look better than any Nintendo handheld before it.', 'Portable play control reaches a new level with these amazing features, allowing for new and unique gameplay mechanics. A built-in motion sensor and gyro sensor can react to the motion and tilt of the system, so whether players are twisting their systems side to side or moving them up and down, their motion-compatible Nintendo 3DS games respond instantly.', 'The Nintendo 3DS XL system uses its two outer cameras to see the world in 3D, much like the human eye. This allows for the creation of 3D photos, 3D video, and even 3D stop-motion animations, that make for an eye-popping addition to your next photo op.', 'Social and wired like no Nintendo system before it, Nintendo 3DS XL brings fellow players together in exciting new ways with StreetPass communication. Set your Nintendo 3DS XL to Sleep Mode and carry it with you wherever you go to exchange game data like Mii characters, high scores, and custom characters with other users you pass on the street. You control what data you exchange, and you can exchange data for multiple games at once, making virtual connections with real-world people you encounter in your daily life.', 'Your Nintendo 3DS XL system can automatically connect to a wireless Internet access point. Once connected, special items will download automatically to your system via the SpotPass feature, even while in sleep mode. Some of these surprise items include exclusive content and promotions from Nintendo Zone, unique 3D videos from the Nintendo Video service, and add-on game content from your favorite Nintendo 3DS games.']","by

The Sims 3 Greatest Hits,,['1 Player!'],"['Video Games', 'PlayStation 3', 'Games']",{},"['In earlier Sims games, players interact with a household of virtual computer people. In The Sims 3, players interact with an entire neighborhood. Instead of playing each family discretely on its individual lot, players can now take their characters anywhere in town -- to a friend\'s house, out to a restaurant, to a favorite park, or even to work. No matter which Sim the player is currently following, however, all the characters in the neighborhood are active whenever the game is being played. Events that take place on the other side of town can have an effect on situations all across the neighborhood, just as the player\'s characters may influence the rest of the community with their actions (or inaction). Sims are now quick to pull out their mobile phones and keep one another informed, even if only about the latest gossip. The Create-A-Sim system in the Sims 3 refines the powerful tools featured in the Sims 2. Players have much more finely graduated control over many physical aspects of the characters they create. For example, a slider allows a choice of any size and shape between rail-thin and very overweight, instead of offering only three set body types, and a second slider controls the character\'s muscularity. To a greater degree than the previous game\'s character editor, the new tools give players the power to create recognizable Sim versions of people they know (or would like to know). Sims personalities are now determined by up to five distinguishing traits, such as ""hot headed,"" ""conversationalist,"" ""clumsy,"" ""great cook,"" ""slob,"" ""good sense of humor,"" and even ""neurotic"" or ""paranoid."" Players can choose from more than 60 available traits when they create each new Sim.']",Electronic Arts,"['>#15,966 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#575 in Video Games > PlayStation 3 > Games']",$26.95,Video Games,B00EB417GW

In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.', 'Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he&rsquo;ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.', 'A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.']","by

Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded follows the life of Larry Laffer, a loveable loser who is a balding, dorky, double entendre-speaking, leisure suit-wearing lady's man. The games follow Larry as he spends much of his life trying, unsuccessfully, to seduce attractive women. The first game in the series, Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards, was first published in 1987 and helped build the Sierra On-Line dynasty. Featured in a score of original software titles since then (not even counting numerous anthologies, repackagings, and cameo appearances), the series' namesake hero, Larry Laffer, is a bumbling, persistent everyman who just wants to be loved. Is that so wrong? With the help of Al Lowe, Larry's progenitor and designer of all of Larry's classic adventures, Replay Games is remaking the landmark first game for an entire new generation (or two!). Expanded and enhanced in every detail and ready for both mobile devices and PCs, Larry is being reborn for the players who might've seen their parents (or grandparents!) playing Larry behind closed doors.""]","by
