It's five years after the first game and the Jedi are being crushed  by the Sith. The twisted wreck named Darth Sion will bring down the Republic, unless a lone  Jedi can reconnect with the Force. You will guide this Jedi and make an important decision:  Do you follow the Light or succumb to the Dark?"", '', 'Smug Statement: The Sith Lords is smart, deep, dark, and stands as the best thing to happen to Star Wars since Timothy Zahn penned the extraordinary Heir to the Empire trilogy. Much like a Padawan learning the ways of the Force from a Jedi Master, Obsidian Entertainment has embraced the teachings of BioWare, built upon the original formula, and forged a powerful sequel that will take your breath away faster than Vader evercould.', ""In the five years that have passed since the fall of Lord Malak, the Dark Side of the Force has spread across the galaxy like a disease. Sith Lord attacks have devastated the Old Republic, and the Jedi guardians are on the verge of extinction. The Republic's only hope of survival lies within your uncertain hands. Awakening in a battle-damaged vessel that is spinning uncontrollably through an asteroid field, you have no recollection of your past, yet you can feel the Force flowing through your veins. Will you side with the Republic and battle the Sith scourge? Or will you fade into darkness and let evil reign?"", 'This compelling introduction pulls you into the plot, keeping you completely transfixed as you tip the scales between the light and dark and scour the cosmos for clues that will unearth your enigmatic past. The tale is paced to perfection and never once feels like it is making unnecessary detours to lengthen the experience.', 'From HK-47\'s amusing ""droid prejudice"" banter to Kreia\'s cryptic messages, the game is overflowing with fascinating personalities and some of the most believable characters to ever be brought to life in a game. Again, pacing is used expertly to develop relationships with the player. As the plot unfolds, you\'ll be forced to decide who to trust, who to keep close, and who to keep a watchful eye on. When you communicate with your allies, your choice of words will affect your standing with them. If you have a high enough influence over them, they may open up to you and follow your ways (be it light ordark).', ""The game also dives deeper into Star Wars lore as it utilizes a much wider selection of alien species, weapons, and gear, as well as planets that we really haven't seen much of in the movies or games. Obsidian can also be commended for creating not one, but two of the most fearsome and awe-inspiring nemeses in the Star Wars universe. Discovering who these Sith Lords are is another of the games exciting mysteries."", ""On the gameplay front, Obsidian stuck to the formula of the original game, but has built upon it with little additions and subtle tweaks. Of course, this still means that your supporting party will blindly run over a clearly visible mine, load times are just as extensive, some of the loose ends in the plot are not tied up (what's up with the HK droids?), and slowdown occurs when too many characters engage in battle. In short it still has its annoyances, yet the new material more than makes up for them. As you engage in conversation, you can now tap into your skills to add a new level of persuasion. For instance, if your character is knowledgeable to the subject matter, you may be prompted with an awareness option. Another interesting addition is the ability to break down items into components that you can turn around and use to create a wide variety of things."", ""The missions that you'll undertake are just as varied, and the consequences to your actions can be just as cataclysmic. A raised level cap won't stunt your characters growth this time around, and the variety that stems from the new character interactions only heightens the reasons to play this game numerous times. Many of the visuals are a bit underwhelming, but the detail in the facial modeling is much more defined, and you won't see as many unintentional identical twins throughout yourjourney."", ""It's almost impossible to deny the charms that emerge from this title's expertly crafted story and unbound freedom. The Sith Lords is a crowning accomplishment for video games and one of the finest Star Wars stories ever told."", '<br><br><B>Graphics:</B><br>Better facial models, but the environments are still bland and slowdown does occur', '<br><br><B>Sound:</B><br>The score fits perfectly into Star Wars canon, and the character dialogue is some of the best to date', '<br><br><B>Playability:</B><br>The same engine with a few enhancements around the edges. Influencing characters and making items are done well', '<br><br><B>Entertainment:</B><br>You absolutely have to play it twice to see where the story goes for light and dark', '<br><br><B>Replay:</B><br>High <br><br>Rated: <B>9.25 out of 10</B><br>Editor: <B>Andrew Reiner</B><br>Issue: <B>February 2005</B><br><br><B>2nd Opinion:</B><br> The call of The Sith Lords is impossible to resist. Embracing the dark side, I twisted an apprentice to my corrupt will, polluted the Force with senseless slaughter, and was told by my loyal HK unit that I was like ""a delightful random cruelty generator."" Even more than its predecessor, The Sith Lords provides countless opportunities for players to revel in the aftermath of their own choices. Essentially, anyone who said that Obsidian couldn\'t live up to the standards set by BioWare\'s first installment should be stuffing their mouths full of Bantha fodder right about now. Every exemplary aspect of KOTOR has actually been improved through expanded dialogue options, tons of alignment-specific variables, and a more engaging story. Honestly, I want to give this game an even higher score, but I just can\'t ignore the multitude of technical problems (like pathfinding and battle glitches) and certain key plot point omissions. Regardless, despite the imperfections, The Sith Lords crushes the feeble windpipes of any other RPG of 2004.<br><br>Rated: <B>9 out of 10</B><br>Editor: <B>Joe Juba</B><br><br><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif""></a><br><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a>']","by

It contains a meager 25-hour critical path (one of the dungeons is even repeated!), jarring load times before each fight, and an absence of money or shops that leaves you with a constant shortage of necessary recovery items. I'm not against titles breaking from conventions, but these are some of the worst decisions outside of Charles Grodin'sresume."", ""Unfortunately, the area where Episode II has received the greatest attention is also where it falters the most. It sports a redesigned battle system that focuses much more on combined efforts rather than individual abilities. By stocking extra attacks and using the shared Boost gauge, the party can cooperatively unleash devastating combos. First you attack a sequence of zones on an enemy (which breaks its defense), then boost other characters into the action queue so they can take advantage of the weakened foe. Unfortunately, this method quickly becomes the only viable way to inflict damage on any enemy; whether it's a simple encounter or key boss fight, every battle is a pathetic routine of eating attacks as you build up your various gauges in preparation for the big assault."", 'My favorite thing about the first Xenosaga was the way it systematically gave the finger to anyone who didn\'t devote themselves, body and soul, to taking in the whole experience. ""Oh, you don\'t want to watch the plot or figure out the skill system?"" the game seemed to say, ""Well toughen up, buttercup. It\'s a long ride."" On the other hand, Episode II appears to be aimed squarely at the milquetoasts who couldn\'t handle the previous iteration, coddling and cooing ""Do you want a lolly, sweetheart?"" Where the series\' balance (or imbalance) between story and action was once the subject of criticism, the frequency of amazing cutscenes is now all that redeems Episode II.', '']","by

This game begins 150 years prior to the original Suikoden, with a young knight in service to the Gaien navy. When he comes into contact with the cursed Rune of Punishment, he's banished from his country -- and his adventure begins."", '', 'Any game featuring a hero with an extreme bowl cut is going to have to try a little bit harder to endear itself to the gaming community. Fortunately, with outstanding gameplay trumping its predecessor and a plot to rival today\'s global power struggles, Suikoden IV covers more than enough ground to compensate for the fashion follies of its nameless hero (""Buster"" in my playthrough. Try it. It works). From the little touches like dilated pupils and oddly satisfying death animations to the grand world-enveloping storyline, Suikoden IV is a unique and gratifying RPG experience for gamers seeking something a little different.', 'As fans of the series have come to expect, the battle system for Suikoden IV has been entirely reworked. Though characters can still perform combo attacks with each other, the pairing system from the previous game has been scrapped in favor of a more traditional four-person lineup, with each warrior acting individually. To give the combat a little more variation, you\'ll occasionally have fights that depart drastically from the standard form: Ship battles have you firing your rune cannons across a grid-based battlefield, and the one-on-one duels (think ""Rock, Paper, Scissors,"" but with swords) make a return. Though these additional combat styles are simplistic, they are still great fun, and a welcome deviation from the normal pattern.', 'With the numerous entertaining battles and engaging story, part of me wants to wholeheartedly recommend Suikoden IV, but it gets hamstrung in a couple of important places. First of all, with the advent of recorded dialogue, the whole ""silent hero"" concept has ceased to be endearing, and instead makes every story point surrounding him awkward. The supporting cast typically won\'t even do the ""What was that? You want us to attack?"" work-around, which renders your main hero a strangely mute non-presence in the events determining his fate.', 'Perhaps the biggest detriment to Suikoden IV can best be characterized by Milhouse Van Houten\'s immortal utterance: ""When are they going to get to the fireworks factory?"" There are always exciting events just looming on the horizon, but many require bouts of oceanic exploration before they unfold. Here\'s the problem: your ship moves like a landmass with sails, and random encounters spring up every five seconds or so. This means that every time you need to go exploring, the game is artificially extended by about 45 minutes because of the inordinate amount of time it takes to traverse even a small expanse of the ocean.', ""Fortunately, between these bouts of tedium (which aren't a constant problem), the story progresses at a respectable clip, with plenty of revelations and a steady influx of new members to keep your party interesting. Add to that several moments in the story that will leave you staring at your screen slack-jawed in awe, and you have an outstanding adventure that rewards you well for your perseverance. Wisely borrowing elements from classics like Final Fantasy X and Chrono Cross, at its best moments Suikoden IV sits right up there with the most outstanding RPGs ever created."", '<br><br><B>Graphics:</B><br>Crisp, colorful visuals (especially running in 480p) and a stunning oceanic setting puts this entry leagues ahead of its predecessors', '<br><br><B>Sound:</B><br>The score is beautiful, and the addition of voice acting (except for the silent hero) breathes life into the world', '<br><br><B>Playability:</B><br> The new battle system is fast and fun, but controlling your ship is like driving a soggy sweater', ""<br><br><B>Entertainment:</B><br>When it's good, it's amazing.

The inclusion of excellent spoken dialogue helps flesh out the characters, but for some reason, Konami opted to keep the lead character silent. This absolutely drove me nuts. People are conversing with him, why is he just standing there? Your main character may seem like a ghost at times, but Konami did a tremendous job with the supporting cast. Combat has also improved dramatically, and thankfully, Konami has ditched the horrendous teammate system from the previous iteration. I love how the Rune of Punishment has a backlash, and combo attacks are always fun to watch. Ship battles are a bit simple, yet are a nice addition, and nothing beats questing for all 108 of the Stars of Destiny. Once again, Konami has crafted one of the finest RPGs to date.

Deemed a violation of international law and of the Japanese Post-War Constitution, Korea and China become outraged.\n\nSecretly, the head of the IDF begins launching information-warfare attacks against Japan and blaming the attacks on North Korea. When the U.S. intervenes, as they are obligated to under Article 9 of the Japanese Post-War Constitution, the U.S. is attacked as well, forcing North Korea to escalate the situation with a pre-emptive invasion of South Korea.\n\nAs war erupts on the Korean Peninsula, Sam Fisher must thwart the alliance between the Japanese Admiral, a neurotic computer hacker, and the head of an international paramilitary company in order to prevent the rekindling of a massive world war in the Pacific.\n\n\nDescription\nIt's 2007, a new world-war is brewing in the pacific. Information Warfare attacks have devastated the Japanese economy and there is rising tension between Japan, China and North Korea. Third Echelon and everyone's favourite secret agent have been sent to investigate a seemingly unrelated incident in the region but with information warfare, a traffic of guns, guerrilla fighters, computer hackers and mercenary companies, a web of intrigue stands between Sam Fisher and a way to diffuse the World War in the making.\nOperatives must infiltrate deep into hostile territory and aggressively collect critical intelligence, closer than ever to enemy soldiers.\n\nYou are Sam Fisher, the NSA's most elite black-ops agent. To achieve your mission you will kill from close range, attack with your combat knife, shoot with the prototype Land Warrior rifle, and use radical suppression techniques such as the inverted neck break. Also take on cooperative multiplayer infiltration missions, where teamwork is the ultimate weapon.As the enemy evolves, so must you."", 'Sam Fisher is back for more espionage and intrigue in Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. All the nail biting about whether to go in ""hot"" with guns blazing, or to use stealth is back in this new version, plus some amazing improvements. Chaos Theory ups the ante with vastly improved graphics, totally open level design, and coop gameplay. Fresh from the East Timor operations, Fisher is now put on the front lines of information warfare. The year is 2008 and the world is suffering from citywide blackouts, stock exchange sabotage, and electronic hijacking of national defense systems. The stakes are high and Fisher, as the NSA\'s most elite black-ops agent, is inserted in operations to aggressively gather intelligence. A wide range of missions call on a lethal mixture of weapons and close range combat. While Chaos Theory demands the same agility and athleticism required in previous Splinter Cell incarnations, some new weapons, gadgets and moves are available, such as the prototype Land Warrior rifle, and the stealthy, but oh-so-deadly inverted neck break.', 'In addition to an improved graphics engine, physics are enhanced, too. Enhancements like rag doll physics, particle effects, and realistic interaction with the environment make the Splinter Cell experience more immersive than ever. Just as judging your environment was crucial in past Splinter Cell games, Chaos Theory demands that you understand the delicate balance between light and shadow to stay alive.', ""Chaos Theory offers great replayability in single player mode, thanks to its vast, open level design. There's always more than one way to achieve your objectives. At the beginning of each mission you are given your objectives, but you must choose how to go about completing them. Decisions about stealth versus conflict are yours to make, too. Should you enter a mission with non-lethal weaponry, a host of guns and ammo, or a little bit of both? You decide."", 'The Splinter Cell franchise is known for its tense, stealth-driven multi-player modes, and Chaos Theory is no exception. This version adds unique cooperative modes where you and your teammates must complete infiltration missions. Try to keep each other alive. Try to thrive in the dark and strike when the moment is right.']","by

The evil Space Pirates are up to their old tricks again, this time on a remote planet called Tallon IV, so Samus must embark on another adventure through uncharted territory. While the perspective has changed from 2D to 3D, Metroid Prime still features many of the same elements found in the previous three games on the NES and Super NES. Samus can outfit her space suit with new weapon upgrades found along the journey, including old favorites such as the Wave Beam and Freeze Beam, allowing her to more effectively battle creatures as well as uncover new areas. Gameplay still emphasizes exploration over non-stop action, but there are still confrontations with boss characters spanning multiple screens in height and puzzles to solve using the right combination of equipment. Samus' visor can also be upgraded in the same manner as her weapons, and players will need to effectively use the visor's thermal, combat, X-ray, and scanning abilities in order to advance through the game. Once activated, the thermal display can be used to isolate weak points on an enemy or detect them hiding under the cover of darkness. Samus can also use her morph ball ability, which automatically switches the perspective behind the hero as she rolls along hallways and tunnels to escape danger or to break through barriers. The technology offered by the GameCube allowed developer Retro Studios to create a world with detail not present in earlier versions of the series. Each environment offers effects such as billowing gasses, electrical interference, sparks, explosions, and real-time weather designed to make the planet come alive with activity. As a bonus, Metroid Prime supports the GameCube -- Game Boy Advance Cable for connection with Metroid Fusion, allowing players to activate secrets intended to enhance both titles.""]","by

The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways  simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy toplay."", 'The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.', ""There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones  broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure."", 'One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.', ""But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series."", '<br><br><B>Sound:</B><br>Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakers', '<br><br><B>Playability:</B><br> Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challenging', '<br><br><B>Entertainment:</B><br>Like many of its predecessors  a true classic', '<br><br><B>Replay:</B><br>Moderate <br><br>Rated: <B>9.5 out of 10</B><br>Editor: <B>Matt Miller</B><br>Issue: <B>February 2005</B><br><br><B>2nd Opinion:</B><br> There\'s a bird sitting on my head, I\'m no larger than a toenail clipping, and I\'ve been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I\'m having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can\'t get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it\'s one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you\'ll remember for a lifetime.<br><br>Rated: <B>9.5 out of 10</B><br>Editor: <B>Andrew Reiner</B><br><br><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif""></a><br><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a>']","by

Six real-world rail lines are included from throughout history, including the Flying Scotsman line of 1920s England and the modern Odakyu Electric Rail commuter line in Tokyo. Attendees at the National Model Railroad Association's August 2000 convention marveled at the game's painstaking attention to detail. But this game is not a model railroad game; it simulates the real thing. The game's developers traveled across the world with cameras and microphones in order to authentically capture the trains in their natural habitats. Train Simulator lets you experience the world's greatest trains in all their glory. Train aficionados can drive the train, run the rail yard, or dive in with the terrain editor and create the rail lines of their dreams.

It's what happens after they squeal that is truly disturbing. You can do the humane thing and let them go, or you can finish them off in a way that usually leaves a blood smear the size of Rhode Island. Horror movie fanatics like myself will appreciate just how creative Volition has been with the vast array of deaths in this game. Limbs and heads are lost in fans, bodies are crushed in compactors, humans are added to shark and python diets, facial cosmetics are taken to the next level in deep fryers, and I've learned that wood isn't the only thing that burns in fireplaces. These executions are so grisly that you can't help but grimace at each drop of blood that is spilled. They are sick. They are wrong. But they are also executed brilliantly. If you think that a specific execution may be too much for your heart to handle, don't do it. Just get the info you need and release your prisoner. The player is the one who determines how violent the action gets. Do you value your ethics? Or do you want a gruesome thrill? The choice is yours."", ""Mechanically, the interrogation system is easy to use and the array of actions that The Punisher can utilize is quite impressive. Volition also did a phenomenal job with level design. No two stages feel alike, and each is brimming with unique death traps, scripted events, and questioning techniques. The game also embraces the atmosphere of the comic series to such a degree that it also feels like you are playing through one of its stories. Several of Frank Castle's recent affairs in the comics are recreated, and Volition even enlisted the talent of longtime Punisher scribe Garth Ennis to give this script that authentic feel. To much surprise (this is going to floor you), this game isn't nearly as gory as the comic book. Regardless though, The Punisher still takes video game violence to the next level. In many ways, it makes Manhunt look as meek and mild as Sesame Street."", ""It's a decent play, but it doesn't stack up to other run and gun shooters like Max Payne and Psi-Ops.

Frank Castle is a decorated war veteran who lost his family when a mob hit went wrong. Since then he's fought to punish any who use violence for Personal gain, without caring who gets in the way. Now he applies his military training to a new mission: The total destruction of all crime syndicates. Help the Punisher eliminate his latest target, by using mobsters' techniques and weapons against them."", '', 'Until a developer creates a game that puts players into the shoes of a severely demented protagonist who disembowels his adversaries with a plastic fork and wears their intestines as suspenders, The Punisher will hold the notorious distinction of being the most grotesque and violent game to date. While most of the gameplay unfolds through fairly tame and enjoyable shootouts reminiscent of the Max Payne series, it paves its own bloody path with a unique interrogation system that shows just how ruthless and psychotic The Punisher can be.', ""Whether you are holding an adversary at gunpoint, dangling them off of a ledge, or threatening to grind the flesh off of their face on an electric sander, The Punisher knows just how to make people talk. It's what happens after they squeal that is truly disturbing. You can do the humane thing and let them go, or you can finish them off in a way that usually leaves a blood smear the size of Rhode Island. Horror movie fanatics like myself will appreciate just how creative Volition has been with the vast array of deaths in this game. Limbs and heads are lost in fans, bodies are crushed in compactors, humans are added to shark and python diets, facial cosmetics are taken to the next level in deep fryers, and I've learned that wood isn't the only thing that burns in fireplaces. These executions are so grisly that you can't help but grimace at each drop of blood that is spilled. They are sick. They are wrong. But they are also executed brilliantly. If you think that a specific execution may be too much for your heart to handle, don't do it. Just get the info you need and release your prisoner. The player is the one who determines how violent the action gets. Do you value your ethics? Or do you want a gruesome thrill? The choice is yours."", ""Mechanically, the interrogation system is easy to use and the array of actions that The Punisher can utilize is quite impressive. Volition also did a phenomenal job with level design. No two stages feel alike, and each is brimming with unique death traps, scripted events, and questioning techniques. The game also embraces the atmosphere of the comic series to such a degree that it also feels like you are playing through one of its stories. Several of Frank Castle's recent affairs in the comics are recreated, and Volition even enlisted the talent of longtime Punisher scribe Garth Ennis to give this script that authentic feel. To much surprise (this is going to floor you), this game isn't nearly as gory as the comic book. Regardless though, The Punisher still takes video game violence to the next level. In many ways, it makes Manhunt look as meek and mild as Sesame Street."", ""It's a decent play, but it doesn't stack up to other run and gun shooters like Max Payne and Psi-Ops.

With so many clear improvements, Lone Wolf is an even better game than the first, but also has a few flaws that the original didn't."", ""The biggest difference in Lone Wolf is that there are other types of vehicles to pilot besides giant robots. Besides Mechs, you'll control battle armor, tanks, and VTOLs over the course of the game. You can even get out of your vehicle at any time during a mission and run around. All of the different vehicle types control well, but the missions that require you to spend a lot of time on foot somewhat suck.

The core gameplay is just as fun as the first, and I really liked the variety of missions. I personally found the tank levels especially enjoyable  using its cannon as a sniper rifle will never get old. The ability to switch vehicles really emphasizes the scale of the Mechs  much more so than in the first title, I felt like I was piloting an unstoppable engine of destruction. The inclusion of both new and old Mechs makes for a good selection of the giant war machines."", ""The addition of a couple of classic boss battles is also a really nice touch. The final boss is one of the coolest-looking foes I've faced in a long time, and overall the graphics are great. Both the Mechs and environments are much more detailed than in the first game (although there are some heavy draw distance issues), and the cutscenes look fantastic. The soundtrack is really fitting, and the story is engaging, while a bit sparse."", ""Of course, online play is a huge part of the MechAssault franchise, and in this arena Lone Wolf certainly doesn't disappoint. It plays much like the first title's online mode, although the new vehicle types add a lot of flexibility within individual maps. It's fast and frantic to the point where it can be difficult to formulate a strategy, but seldom frustrating. The new vehicle types have allowed for some interesting game types and maps, so Lone Wolf's online play really offers something for everyone. Conquest mode, in which different teams vie for control of the solar system in a persistent war, will no doubt become one of the biggest draws on Xbox Live."", ""While some of MechAssault 2's new features came with unexpected side effects, Day 1 must be applauded for doing so much with this sequel.

As a great follow up to a stellar game, Lone Wolf is no exception to the rule. It offers some of the most impressive destruction and particle effects you\'ll come across anywhere. The onscreen chaos is tremendous in scope, and demolishing everything in your path is cathartic on a profound level. That\'s why I have something of a major gripe with the on-foot sections of the single-player game. While usually short, they take away what I like most about the series  that overwhelming sense of power. Also, an inordinate amount of distance fog throughout dulls some of the visual excitement. There\'s also something of an uneven difficulty curve as you play, with levels hopscotching back and forth between really hard and super easy, but overall the campaign mode is excellent. Multiplayer gamers should be extremely pleased with the new innovations in their department.

I was blown away by the game\'s ability to seamlessly transition between frenzied FPS and harrowing third-person platforming. Oddworld has also created a highly innovative ammo system. Not only are you using wildlife as ""live"" ammo, you actually have to scour your surroundings and hunt for more munitions. The ammo that you unload produces a variety of results. Firing a Bolamite at a foe will tie them up in sticky webbing. Stunkz scent will make anyone near it gag. Boombats explode. And the Chippunk is just so darn cute that enemies will go to any length to squish it. Boss fights are demanding of different strategies, and even the way that the health system is managed is a complete departure from what we are accustomed to, as you shake off damage like a wet dog does water. All told, the gameplay package is creative, fun, and the perfect fit for an Oddworld game.', ""If you are of the belief that you've seen everything that video games have to offer, getting to know the Stranger will make you realize that we haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what can be done in game development."", ""<br /><br /><b>Graphics:</b><br />There's a little draw in, but it doesn't take away from the magnificence of the vistas and the creatures that inhabit the land"", ""<br /><br /><b>Sound:</b><br />You'll be hard-pressed to find better character voices in a game.

It has over-the-top, larger than life 3-on-3 gaming like you'd see on the best street courts. Play as any of the biggest NBA stars and pull off hundreds of crazy moves and dunks that you'd never see in a regular NBA game.   New Dunk Contest mode hits the street -- see if you can execute the big air slams, link together combos in mid-air and impress the three-judge panel"", '<P>Some franchises just run out of steam. NBA Jam is one of them. It started off strong&nbsp;&#8211; redefining video game basketball as we know it &#8211; had a phenomenal sophomore year, then plummeted from grace with such momentum that even those who praised the series wouldn\'t touch it with a ten-foot pole. NBA Street is walking directly in the footsteps of this highly influential game, but it has no intention of hanging its shoes up anytime soon. While sticking to the high-flying, rim-rockin\' antics that launched the series to the top of the charts, developer EA Canada has implemented enough exciting new content to make the experience fresh and addictive yet again.</P> <P>In many ways, EA has gone back to the drawing board to present the game in an entirely new light. Moving away from the mile-high afros, graffiti-riddled courts, and playful caricaturizing of the previous two releases, this series\' ankle-breaking jukes and orbital slams are now visualized with the utmost realism. Courts are teeming with animated fans, leaves falling off of trees, and breathtaking lighting effects that produce blinding rays and photorealistic shading. The player models are also impressively detailed with swaying jerseys, the authentication of signature apparel, and facial texturing that is perfected to the very pimple. </P> <P>For those of you who feel that looks mean about as much as a new hair color for Dennis Rodman, the most significant changes to this year\'s addition stem from gameplay. Focusing on the most exciting aspect of the game, dunks reign supreme in this iteration. Above and beyond the the assortment of jams that you\'ll be able to perform throughout the course of the game, players can now customize their slams when activating a GameBreaker. When your character takes flight, tapping the right analog stick in different directions will make your player perform different moves such as windmills, double pumps, and an array of remarkable feats. More impressive yet, you can also toss the ball to an airborne teammate before you land to create a two- or three-man combo that will simply decimate your opponent.</P> <P>To ensure that players are flying through the air at any given time, EA has also created an insanely deep Dunk Contest mode. Bounce the rock behind your back, leap to grab it, then spin and double pump as you bring the backboard crashing to the ground. Or if you really want to get crazy, drag props such as vending machines and port-a-potties onto the court and soar over them. Unlike the latest entry of NBA Live, this mode is easy to use, has more slams in its arsenal than Spud Webb (who is in the game), and couldn\'t be much more entertaining. </P> <P>Regarding the battle for position on the court, EA has removed the trick buttons in favor of mapping deke moves to the right analog stick. Each 45-degree angle performs a different move. Apply the modifier buttons to the equation and you have an expansive arsenal at your fingertips. This new format is much easier to tap into and be successful with. Much like dunking, a combo meter tracks how many dekes you can chain together and creates a higher multiplier for the forthcoming shot or dunk.</P> <P>Be a Legend mode has been replaced by the similarly designed and equally amusing Street Challenge. Build a baller from the ground up, create your own shoes, and compete in challenges that range from dunk-only contests to the first to perform a GameBreaker. As you gain reputation, you\'ll be asked to join an NBA team for league play. You\'ll also get the chance to build your own court. As nice as it is to have turf to call your own, there\'s little in the way of customization options.</P> <P>On occasion, your CPU opponents will make some<B> </B>silly mistakes along the lines of using a GameBreaker to shoot a three-pointer during a dunk-only contest, but the AI is still mighty impressive. Rather than going the way of the dodo like other arcade basketball franchises, Street continues to gain momentum and is more desirable now than it has ever been.</P><BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Slamfest 2005.

Today\'s case in point: Street 3. With a huge range of customization options, killer online play, and a fantastic dunk contest (that is thankfully easier to execute than NBA Live\'s), Street 3 does little wrong. The use of the right analog stick combined with the shoulder buttons to execute tricks, jukes, and dunks gives the player more control over what actions take place on the court, which in turn makes the game feel smoother.

The new material that EA has implemented is minimal at best, and most of the additions don\'t generate a lot of excitement. With that said, this is still the best-playing baseball game on the market. It may feel old hat, but it handles the fundamentals and nuances of the game much better than Major League. You really get the distinct feeling that the team spent a lot of time polishing the game to attain the highest level of authenticity possible.</P> <P>Fielding is tighter than last year, allowing players to really get a good feel for each position on the diamond. The implementation of a perfect marker on the pitching meter makes it more difficult to paint the corners, so you shouldn\'t throw as many no-hitters as you did last year. Batters can also read pitchers thanks to the new Hitter\'s Eye feature, which briefly color-coats the ball as it is thrown to tell you what you are swinging at. This looks a bit goofy in my opinion, but since you can\'t read the spin on the laces like players do, it\'s a nice&nbsp;solution.</P> <P>Most of the changes are found in the frontend. As in the Madden games, players can now run the finances of their team and build their own stadium. I really got a kick out of this new feature. Enticing people to come to games by selecting free gifts for fan appreciation days is a lot of fun, and actually having to build a winning team that brings in enough funds to upgrade the stadium facilities makes sense. It\'s very gratifying to watch your stadium grow from a rinky dink park to a colossal sporting venue. The only drawback is that unlike football\'s quick 16-game season, you\'ll need to play or sim through hundreds, maybe thousands of games to get your team where you want it. Going even further with the minor leagues, players can now play and manage rosters for their club\'s A-ball team. Franchise options don\'t get much deeper than this.</P> <P>EA has also included addictive minigames for both batting and pitching. Like Tetris, you can\'t seem to put the controller down once you start playing.

Owner\'s mode gives you some stadium options to play with, but the Spring Training minigames were what I was most excited about. It\'s just too bad that there isn\'t more to scouting in the off-season. If you\'re still slogging through a 162-game season from last year, I could see you not getting this title and being fine with that.

The AI seems a bit savvier, and opponents will grapple when you've got them nearly knocked out to buy for time.

Xion has lost his memory and discovers that he holds two magical rings. Their source are unknown to him, but so is so much else -- he and his friends will travel to find answers. Soon they'll realize how terrifying the world can truly be; Their choices after learning this hard lesson will shake the land, for better or worse."", '', ""Shining Tears is a throwback to a bygone era in gaming. A spin-off of Sega's classic Shining titles, its real-time action is reminiscent of the SNES game Secret of Mana, which is definitely a compliment. In many ways, Shining Tears is a retro-RPG gamer's dream, and will make you feel like you've gone back in time to the early 90s  which, as we all know, is both a good and a bad thing."", ""The plot of Shining Tears is, as Mr. T would say, simply a bunch of jibba jabba, filled with more clichs and stilted dialogue than an episode of Full House. But the plot is not really the draw  the two-character combat is the heart of this game. In single-player you control the primary character while AI handles your partner. But you can also steer the second player with the right analog stick and execute linked attacks between the two with a few clicks of the R1 button. It's a nifty little system that works well, but I found it inferior to playing with a real person (even if it was Joe). Coordinating linked attacks with a second player requires more cooperation and allows you more strategic thinking in battle. This is a definite plus because later fights throw so many hordes of enemies at you you'll feel like you're trying to fight your way out of a crowd at a Color Me Badd concert."", ""After a while, the combat can get as stale as MC Hammer's career, thanks to stages that are repeated over and over, and the necessity of replaying missions with different characters in order to level up your entire crew. The hand-drawn environments are gorgeous, as are the visuals as a whole, but that doesn't mean I want to see the same areas again and again. With repetitive combat and a plot thinner than Tracey Gold, Shining Tears shouldn't be quite as good as it is. But the retro vibe, beautiful graphics and unique control dynamic add a lot of value. It's not the best action/RPG out there, but offers some fun co-op and recalls days past in a far better way than any of the lame jokes I've made in this review."", '']","by

It has received much critical acclaim, and for good reasonthis core technology has made some of the best action/RPGs of the last several years. While other developers have licensed this engine for use in their own games, Snowblind has taken them all to school on how to squeeze the most juice out of it. Return to Arms is a visually stunning game in every way, and a lot of my issues with the first Champions of Norrath have been addressed. It's a pity that there isn't really anything in RtA that moves the genre forward or breaks from convention in any way."", 'All of the standard action/RPG elements are present and accounted for, and for the most part are done with a level of polish and flair rarely seen. Leveling up each character can be done in a nigh-infinite number of ways, since each one has a multitude of skills to develop or ignore at your choice. Bosses drop fatty loot to collect and power up your avatar with, and completing challenges (which become unlocked after finishing a stage) unlocks new online maps as well as hooking you up with bonus stat and skill points. These challenge rounds are easily the most interesting new element of RtA, with nonstandard objectives or restrictions that make you use your gaming skills or solve puzzles to emerge triumphant.', ""Every single change from the original Champions of Norrath is a positive one, as far as I can tell. The removal of random maps sounds like a bummer, but the result is that each level is designed much more tightly and flows better than before. Skills have been rebalanced and seem to be a bit more even, and the two new classes offer unique and fun styles of play. And, as has been mentioned, the latest revision of the Snowblind engine is amazing. Textures give a startling illusion of depth to surfaces, lighting changes give each area a different feel, and the excellent particle effects really bring the flashy spell animations to life. Plus, even though I've been seeing it for the last few years, I still have to stop and marvel at the water this engine can render out."", ""The icing on this cake of fantasy hack n' slash goodness is the amount of content available. Between the four difficulty modes (which are designed like Diablo II's, where you can start the next mode with your powered-up hero after clearing the one before), co-op and competitive online multiplayer, and the seven playable classes, there is an awful lot of game here to adventure through. Whether or not you'll be sick of cleaving orc heads before you finish it is another matter entirely, but rest assured that this is no weaksauce 10-hour quest with little replay value."", ""All of this high-heaped praise begs the question of why isn't RtA the must-have fantasy epic of 2005. The answer to that is simple: Though everything is very well-done, it's difficult to shake the feeling that I've been playing this same game since Diablo came out on PC in 1997. The core concept of bashing skulls and gaining levels and loot is still strong as can be, and I had a lot of fun with RtA, but the foreshadowings of a Dynasty Warriors-like rut are clearly visible. It's rare to see a sequel that does this little to shake up the gameplay formula of the original, but with that being said, anyone who enjoyed the first Champions title or either of the Dark Alliance games will find a lot to love here."", '']","by

The deadly ninja called Ayame travelled the land in search of her mentor when she stumbles across a small village that's been slaughtered. The only suvivor is another ninja girl named Rin, and together they'll use their talents to find the reason for this hideous crime."", '<P>Millions of years ago, the age of the ninja came to a close when a meteor hit the Earth, altering the planet\'s climate. Unable to adapt to these changes, the ninjas gradually became extinct. No, wait&#8230;that was the dinosaurs. In any case, my point is that everything must evolve or eventually die off. Sadly, I\'m afraid that the Tenchu franchise, which once helped define the stealth genre on the original PlayStation, has fallen desperately behind the&nbsp;times.</P> <P>Although Tenchu is once again in the hands of a new publisher (Sega) and new developer (From Software), the end product adheres strictly to the well-worn formula developed by the series. Body-dragging is back from Tenchu 2, and after pulling out our old copy of that game I\'d say you\'d be hard-pressed to find any major differences between the basic moveset of Tenchu 2 and Fatal Shadows.</P> <P>That\'s not to say that there isn\'t some fun to be had here. Being a ninja is just plain cool, and the thrill of grappling from rooftop to rooftop, using a host of ninja items, and pulling off nicely animated stealth kills (of which there are a ton to unlock) will always be there. However, I\'m a little disappointed that Tenchu isn\'t pushing the genre forward like Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid have.</P><BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Another entry in the long-running ninja stealth series <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>Better character models than the last iteration, but nothing spectacular <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>Nice, tasteful ambient score with a Japanese folk music flavor  <BR><BR><B>Playability:</B><BR>The combat is simplistic, but effective &#8211; if you can overlook the terrible camera  <BR><BR><B>Entertainment:</B><BR>Being a shadow warrior still has its charms, but Tenchu badly needs an overhaul  <BR><BR><B>Replay:</B><BR>Moderate <BR><BR>Rated: <B>7 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Matt Helgeson</B><BR>Issue: <B>March 2005</B><BR><BR><B>2nd Opinion:</B><BR> Ever since the original Tenchu, I have been waiting patiently for this series to move forward, and unfortunately Fatal Shadows does little new and can be summed simply as just more of the same. Not that it\'s a bad thing. It\'s just the series could be so much more than navigating a simple environment, waiting for an opportune moment, and dealing out a stealth kill. Splinter Cell (among others) has moved the stealth genre forward, but Tenchu is still living in the past in both the gameplay and graphics departments. The environments are drab, and the AI is extremely poor at times. For example, in one level I would jump into the water when I was spotted, and the ninjas tracking me down would react by following me into the drink only to discover they couldn\'t swim and instantly drowned. Who knew? Ninjas can\'t swim. Fatal Shadows does manage to tread water, but that\'s about it.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>6.75 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Andy McNamara</B><BR><BR><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Amazon.com</i>']",Sega,"['>#54,410 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#1,817 in Video Games > More Systems > PlayStation 2 > Games']",$45.06,Video Games,B0007GDMFC

As painful as it is to look at, playing this game is like running naked through a thorn-infested briar.

She soon escapes, only to remember that she was in a car crash and her parents are dead. Unfortunately, the manor residents want to kill her, and she has no idea why. Armed only with her wits and befriended by the German Shepard Hewie, Fiona must escape the manor at all costs. As Fiona and Hewie explore the manor, they will face several different types of foes. While Fiona has the ability to kick and shove enemies, its mostly Hewie who will do the attacking. If Fiona is hit too many times, her panic bar will fill up and she will become uncontrollable or frozen in place. Fortunately, like any old manor, there are plenty of places for Fiona to hide or duck behind. She can crawl under beds, duck into wardrobes, and hide in the shower. In addition to attacking, Fiona can also give Hewie different commands such as come, sit, search, attack, and even shake hands. He can be trained too, by praising him when he follows a command and scolding him when he doesnt.']","by

Much darker in theme, the four dimensions contain cathedrals, tombs of the undead, base installations and nightmarish realms, and each dimension is broken into various levels with an end-boss. When a dimension's rune is collected, the player returns to a central hub from which other levels are chosen.\n\nWith the 3D environments, a number of dark and detailed textures are used to create an evil-looking atmosphere. The level architecture is quite astonishing, featuring pillars, lava rivers, cracks in walls, ceiling-support beams and other gothic details. Nine Inch Nails' ambient soundtrack adds to the experience with subtle but disturbing noises.\n\nControls are precise, with an emphasis on strafing around monsters, and movement is in full 360 degrees allowing one to view all aspects of the level. Monsters are innovative and smart, including zombies that tear off their own limbs and throw them as weapons, undead marines, hellhounds, piranha-like fish, evasive and fast-moving Fiends, sword-bearing knights, and the menacing Shambler. Likewise, the armaments are excellent, ranging from an axe and grenade and rocket launchers to the double-barreled shotgun and Nailgun.\n\nPower-ups, such as three different armors, an invulnerable Pentagram of Protection, the devastating Quad Damage and Ring of Shadows, are strewn about the levels creating a level playing field when fighting certain monsters. These items are also useful when involved in a deathmatch. Quake is one of the first games to make use of Internet gaming; 16 combatants can face off on a server or via LAN. Aside from a few lag issues, the engine is stable and runs well on a full server.""]","by
