roviding a fresh and compelling storyline, good graphics and sound, and attention to those little details that can transform a good game into a great one. <P> Fallout is an unofficial sequel to 1987\'s Wasteland, one of the most popular role-playing games of all time. While the overwhelming majority of computer role-playing games are set in some pseudo-medieval, Tolkien/AD&D-inspired world of orcs and battleaxes, Fallout is set in the future, several years after an exchange of nuclear weapons has devastated most of the world. Inhabitants who survived did so largely by sheltering themselves in giant underground vaults. Your character\'s life has been spent entirely within one such vault. A broken chip for your vault\'s water recycler forces your character to leave the relative safety of the vault to search for a replacement chip aboveground in the wasteland, where you\'ll encounter struggling communities of survivors, Road Warrior-esque gangs, human mutants, and even stranger creatures. Hardly a typical setting for a role-playing game, but the originality of the setting is one of the strengths of Fallout. <P> Fallout oozes style. Not content with extrapolating a plausible but unexciting hi-tech view of the future, Fallout\'s design team instead crafted a vision of the future that combines 1950s cold war American culture and early, primitive computer technology (complete with ugly green monochrome screens and an abundance of vacuum tubes), with advanced energy weapons and chemical compounds. Nuka-cola anyone? <P> Negotiations to allow Fallout to utilize Steve Jackson Games\' popular GURPS character system fell apart, but Interplay\'s replacement character creation system is detailed and thorough. Almost every time a computer game is released that purports to be a role-playing game, a seemingly inevitable onslaught of debate ensues over whether or not that game is, in fact, a role-playing game (as opposed to a member of some presumably inferior wanna-be genre). <P> Fallout uses a hybrid system of character development, which is both level-based (your character gains character levels by accumulating experience points) and skill-based (your character has 10 primary skill types that can be improved throughout the course of the game). You can also give your character up to two optional traits (such as the ability to see and function better at night), each having both a positive and negative effect on your character. Gore-mongers will want to pick the ""bloody mess"" trait, which causes your victims to die in the most graphically violent way possible. Finally, every time your character gains three character levels you can add a helpful ""perk"" ability to further distinguish your character. Do you want to be a good-natured doctor with a knack for big guns, a nimble gymnast with an addiction, a ruthless assassin, or a lucky thief? <P> Interaction with nonplayer characters (NPCs) is a bit disappointing. Most of the nonplayer characters in Fallout aren\'t big on conversation and run around blithely and inconsequentially. Shades of the early Ultima games from Richard Garriott and Origin Systems, Stationary NPCs are generally important and will engage in menu-driven conversations. Mobile NPCs, on the other hand, will bark a short message at your character, which will be randomly chosen from three or so available options for that location. <P> Although you only control one character in Fallout, you can convince certain NPCs to join you in your quests, but you\'ll never be able to directly control their actions. Unfortunately, these NPC companions tend to take particular delight in blocking doorways or shooting you (and each other) in the back with semiautomatic weapons. You also won\'t be able to directly access your companions\' inventory or otherwise instruct them to give you items or to equip better armor. Give an NPC a key item and you\'ll have to barter or steal from the NPC in order to get it back. Ingrates. <P> The gaming world is presented from an isometric perspective and the graphics are detailed and extremely similar in style and quality to Origin\'s Crusader games. A sighting bubble, which surrounds your character, ensures that you\'ll never lose track of objects that would otherwise be obscured as a result of the game\'s isometric perspective. The settings are suitably apocalyptic and ironic (junked cars are everywhere, but the prevalent mode of transportation is a two-headed cow caravan). Music is also well done throughout the game, with each setting having its own distinct and often haunting melody. Sound effects are less memorable, but adequate. <P> The world moves along in real time until combat is initiated. There is a large variety of weapons to choose from, including pistols, rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, and plasma guns, and each is capable of killing your enemies in a suitably distinct graphical manner. Combat is strictly turn-based and becomes quite tactical, complete with character initiative, action points, and varying attack modes. <P> Although Interplay has recently released a bug-stomping patch, there are still a couple of annoying bugs in Fallout that may force you to backtrack and try certain tasks again. As the excellent and conveniently spiral-bound manual (the Vault Dweller\'s Survival Guide) suggests, save often. Gameplay is generally delightfully nonlinear, but occasionally the game\'s chronology gets garbled and quests are presented in an illogical sequence that can result in some inappropriate NPC conversations. <P> Even though these minor flaws bring Fallout\'s overall rating down a notch or two, Fallout is not only a worthy successor to Wasteland, it\'s also a role-playing game that is destined to become a classic in its own right. Fallout\'s detailed graphics, compelling plot, and intuitive gameplay should deservedly broaden its appeal beyond the hard-core role-playing game audience. Put simply, Fallout may be the best role-playing game to be released in years. <i>--Desslock</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

In addition, real NBA coaches roam the sidelines, and there is dramatic camera coverage of in-game and out-of-play sequences.

To do this players must first build up an entire ghostly team. There are around 50 ghosts in total and each haunter has its own personality, strengths, and weaknesses. As the game develops the characters themselves will develop and grow. What\'s more, each one has its own unique set of powers - some can make the walls drip with blood while others can cut the lights in the room. Each time you scare a human, or mortal as they are often referred to, you will increase your \'plasm;\' the energy you need to scare them in the first place, but beware. Scare them too much and they will flee from the building, never to be scared again, which will make your job much more difficult. <p/> The game uses a unique AI engine, which gives the player a sense of natural human behavior. The mortals will go about their everyday lives; cooking, going to work, arguing with each other, etc., until they encounter the horrors you control. After facing these horrors, they will become irrational, afraid, and sometimes even go comically insane. Put fright into them is what <i>Ghost Master</i> is all about.

Make your way through 6 interactive worlds with danger around every corner.

You have a weapon that can zap your enemies, and your antennas can shoot a powerful electrical charge at enemies to gain access to power-ups and treasures."", 'The main character of <I>Zapper</I> is a cricket who must rescue his brother, Zipper, from a pilfering magpie.

The goal of the game is to maneuver Zapper through a completely linear 3-D world filled with angry bumblebees, picketing beavers, giant snails, blade-swinging statues, cascading waterfalls, and various other exotic dangers that make you feel like you&#x92;re in a hybrid version of <I>A Bug&#x92;s Life</I> and <I>Indiana Jones</I>. There are six worlds and 20 levels to <I>Zapper</I>, and experienced gamers will have little difficulty moving through all of them quickly. Helping Zapper is his ability to zap lightninglike sparks out of his antennae, which causes some bugs to jump and some boxes to open. By freeing enough fireflies, Zapper gains super-zap abilities, which will eliminate certain dangers and open otherwise locked boxes.', 'Anyone who has played <I>Frogger</I> will immediately recognize the similarity of <I>Zapper</I>.

Early in the game these dangers are easily navigable, though even the most deft gamer will die often before figuring out exactly which obstacles can be traversed.

Navigating the environments is accomplished with the help of a scanner, which delineates enemy fighters in red and friendly units in blue. Various upgrades in weaponry as well as extra lives can be purchased with credits earned during missions. Once players find and rescue colonists during their mission, they can drop them off at multiple locales. Colonists returned to a drop zone will earn players power-ups, while colonists deployed at either a missile crawler or a tank factory will allow players to build ground units for additional support.

GameCube Platinum Pack with Metroid Prime Game,,[],[],{},"['', ""Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others."", ""For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum."", ""The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (<i>Pikmin</i>, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates."", ""Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started with <i>Donkey Kong</i>. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario, <i>Legend of Zelda</i>, <i>Perfect Dark</i>, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pokmon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, and <i>Star Wars</i>."", ""The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming."", ""In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat. <i>--Porter B.

Neverwinter Nights Collector's Edition - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""<I>Neverwinter Nights</I> isn't simply another computer game. It's a Dungeons & Dragons computer game, as well as all the tools you'll need to create your own Dungeons & Dragons adventures. <I>Neverwinter Nights</I> is an achievement. It accomplishes what computer role-playing games set out to do when Wizardry debuted in the late '70s: re-create the social, hands-on experience of tabletop gaming."", ""<I>Neverwinter Nights</I> uses the Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition rules in (nearly) all their complex glory. It's the first game to attempt to fully support D&D 3E's customizable features, and more significantly, it's the first game designed to re-create the experience of playing tabletop D&D. You can play BioWare's extensive campaign alone or online with your friends, or you can use the included Aurora toolset to build your own adventure module and run it for your buddies with all the control you'd have if you were running a tabletop game. The powerful Dungeon Master client lets you put words in nonplayer characters' mouths, control monsters, alter the game world, and customize your adventure on the fly. If playing is your thing, you can join other people's games and play through encounters with other gamers around the world."", ""Everything works as it should and the game is beautiful to behold. BioWare has used a limited 3-D engine to allow you to spin your viewpoint around your character and zoom in on the action. During combat, Mages unleash spectacular spells, Priests raise their symbols to drive undead hordes back, and Rogues tinker with locked chests, while Fighters dodge, parry, and strike ferociously at any attacking beasts. The sound is topnotch, with BioWare's typically high-quality voice acting and music from composer Jeremy Soule."", ""But all isn't perfect."", ""The game makes a great effort of implementing the full D&D 3rd Edition rules, but doesn't quite succeed. In <I>NWN</I>, Paladins lose their Detect Evil and Mount abilities. Druids can shape change into animals, but can't change back to human form at will. Darkvision has no noticeable in-game effect. Troublesome issues for hard-core D&D fans, but it's understandable that some changes would have to be made in order to shoehorn a freeform tabletop RPG into a computer program."", 'Other issues are not so easy to understand: the camera controls are simple and will not allow the user to lower to decrease the camera angle--you\'ll never get anything approaching a character\'s-eye view of the world. Moving to a new section within a building or going from an indoor to an outdoor area takes you out of the game and presents you with a (mercifully short) ""Loading"" screen. There is an artificial limitation on how many henchmen you can hire in the single-player game: you\'re limited to one hireling, and <I>Baldur\'s Gate</I> fans will miss the squabbling party from earlier games. More significant are the problems that arise from trying to re-create a social experience like D&D in a computer game. Multiplayer games with strangers are confusing and not as fun as they sound and, like the tabletop game, they\'re really only as fun as the players and especially the DM you\'re playing with. Multiplayer <I>NWN</I> is only worthwhile if you have a dedicated group and a DM that knows what he or she is doing. The last drawback is the documentation. The manual is large and detailed but it omits key help in module creation; you have to buy a separate strategy guide if you want that information.', ""But though slightly flawed, <I>NWN</I> has indisputably won the holy grail of RPG gaming: getting the Dungeons & Dragons experience into a personal computer. The included campaign is fascinating and the tools are powerful enough to ensure a steady stream of module content from devoted fans. Make no mistake, <I>Neverwinter Nights</I> is an achievement and will likely change the way CRPGs are played from now on. It's a game no RPG fan, no D&D fan, should miss. <I>--Bob Andrews</I>"", '<B>Pros:</B> <ul> <li>Almost perfect implementation of D&D 3E rules <li>Deep single-player game <li>Intriguing multiplayer game <li>Powerful module creation tools </ul> <B>Cons:</B> <ul> <li>Not quite perfect implementation of D&D 3E rules <li>""Loading"" screens <li>Inflexible 3-D camera <li>Only one henchman <li>Multiplayer is dependant on quality players and DM </ul>', ""Do you remember those late-night D&D sessions? They always seemed so illicit. There's a kind of wanton luxury inherent in pretending you are an elf when you should be doing your math. Oh, you can act like you don't know what we're talking about, Elwyn Stormrider. Your secret's safe with us. But though your late-night geek fests have likely been disrupted by school, work, love, or moving away from your long-lost buddies, a new game from BioWare will soon let you reunite your far-flung band and head into the dungeon."", ""More often than not, role-playing games on consoles and personal computers have shied away from that sort of experience--by which we mean the experience of dorks sitting around a table in the basement--and there are valid reasons they have done so. There is a certain amount of linearity that must be accepted without a live moderator to handle events that veer from the beaten path. What's more, the task of creating a completely open-ended mechanism for players to engage in their own storytelling seems daunting--and that's putting it mildly. Imagine trying to convert a game world hundreds of thousands of people have been imagining for years. Then, just for kicks, try to give gamers some measure of the leeway they're accustomed to in freeform, pen-and-paper role-playing. Well, that's precisely the task before veteran developer BioWare. And if the demonstration at this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo is any indication, the company has a lot to be proud of."", ""<i>Neverwinter Nights</i> endeavors to be faithful to Wizards of the Coast's 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons, which will be familiar to anyone who has ever played any version of D&D. <i>Neverwinter Nights</i> actually consists of two separate but related products: a client, which is used to connect to and play in active Internet adventures, and the Aurora Toolset, which aspiring Dungeon Masters can leverage to create tales of action and intrigue."", ""The client portion is where most players' entire experience will reside. Characters are created here, including the full roster of official races and classes and a boggling assortment of character art. Even weird stuff, like some of the new race-specific weapons, are included. Interactions with other characters, the environment, and creatures of the night utilize a radial menu system--think <i>The Sims</i>--where context-appropriate choices fan out wherever you click. Spells, special abilities, and virtually anything else to which you'd need quick access uses the same interface."", ""The 3rd Edition of the venerable D&D system brings with it the concept of feats, which are special abilities selected and honed as you accrue experience. Though we could speak for several hours on the subject without taking a breath, let us simply summarize by saying that as a player you will not want for ways to customize your alter ego. Though <i>Neverwinter Nights</i> is designed to bring computer and tabletop role-playing together, it also sports a fully featured campaign that can be played alone or with friends. No stranger to the genre, BioWare brought about a veritable renaissance in electronic role-playing with its Baldur's Gate series (and the Infinity Engine that underpinned it). Though very little has been announced in the way of details, it seems reasonable to assume that we'll be in for a treat."", ""The Aurora Toolset, like any arcane device of great power, is going to need its secrets coaxed out of it. You can't just walk up to it, turn a few knobs, maybe wave a wand around, and expect it to produce a masterpiece of enduring vision. For one thing, you'll have to provide the vision, which is not included with the product. It does, however, include wizards, or automated tasks, that will excise some of the drudgery from the process. But while perfectly enjoyable campaigns could certainly be created by the novice, truly compelling and well-imagined games are going to take more than imagination."", ""In short, <i>Neverwinter Nights</i> is like any other role-playing game, except the table you're playing on is the size of the planet Earth. So that's something. And don't worry, Elwyn, all the dice are inside the computer now. Nobody has to know. <i>--Tycho Brahe</i> -- <i>GameSpot Review</i>""]","by

But fans of <i>GTA III</i> should note that while <i>State of Emergency</i> contains adult themes and extremely violent gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. Whereas <i>GTA III</i> was about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game, <i>SOE</i> is a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups like <i>Smash TV</i> and <i>Double Dragon</i>. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing graphics."", ""In <i>State of Emergency</i>, you play as one of five selectable characters that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling. Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a single-session mode with a few variations."", ""For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode, but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for another <i>GTA III</i> will not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience that's excellent, but in a very different way.

Lords Of Magic Special Edition and Zeus (Jewel Case) - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['<i>The Lords of Magic Special Edition</i> combines the turn-based exploration and real-time combat of the enhanced <i>Lords of Magic</i> with the all-new <i>Legends of Urak Quest Pack.</i>', ""When we first looked at Impressions' Lords of Magic, we were less than impressed. The game had tons of potential but was marred by numerous flaws, both in the overall design and several specific gameplay elements (you can see our original review here). Lords of Magic Special Edition promises to address the original game's shortcomings - and lo and behold it actually does. The only problem is that the game is still flawed in many ways and is not all that much more compelling than the original."", ""Without rehashing all of the basic information on story and game flow, we'll stick to addressing the changes in the Special Edition and how they affect the overall gameplay experience. One of the more notable new features is the included Legends of Urak Quest Pack. This expansion set of five scripted campaigns challenges you to complete a series of specific quests, sort of like the scenarios in Civilization II. For example, in one quest you play a Death Mage and must find and recover a sacred scepter for your lord, the King of Darkness. Another quest is based on Arthurian legends."", ""Another new feature is the lord editor, which basically allows you to modify your character at the beginning of each game. Instead of accepting the game's default settings for starting heroes, you can modify your starting army choosing units from any of the eight faiths. Using the new map editor, you can also customize the world in which you play."", 'The Special Edition features a number of new creatures, including one legendary creature for each faith. There are also many new wandering creatures as well as a general increase in ""marauding parties"" - easily the game\'s most annoying and infuriating feature. Marauding parties seem to be the rough equivalent to Civilization\'s barbarian tribes, except that they appear at alarming rates and mete out rather severe beatings in the face of seemingly superior opposition. Many a time I found myself cursing the puny marauding parties of wolves and centaurs who would take out half of my precious units and set me back by several days (that\'s game time, not real time).', ""One point in the Special Edition's favor is the fact that, although you spend far too much time battling marauding parties, you will probably spend far less time quarreling with your neighbors - even Balkoth. This is due to the game's enhanced diplomacy model, which offers more options and seems to have fewer loopholes. No longer will Balkoth fork over a level 5 hero when you plead for him (offering nothing in return). You can still acquire another faith's hero, but you have to put up some serious barter to do so. Also, whenever you put an offering on the bargaining table, the game will tell you whether or not it's a fair deal before you accept or decline it. This can be useful for avoiding ill feelings over unintentionally one-sided trade demands."", ""As a result of the improved diplomacy model (and presumably of improved AI), the game plays out a bit more like the story would dictate. Individual faiths are not necessarily at each other's throats and, if you play your cards right, you can actually win the game more easily by befriending your neighbors (except that Balkoth character; nobody likes him). I should point out, though, that the Fire faith begins the game in a very deep hole. No other faith has a positive opinion of Fire (except Chaos, which is typically the weakest of the AI-controlled faiths), and most are downright hostile right from the start."", ""In terms of problems that have been fixed, load times in the Special Edition are generally speedier (a very good thing), and Impressions has added an option to auto-compute battle results before loading the real-time combat engine. There's a trade-off to this, however, as now the auto-compute results are a bit less favorable to your side than they were in the original game."", 'You can now interact with any of your buildings without actually marching a hero to it - a very big improvement. This both saves time and allows you to manage your campaign without running back and forth to the capital city all of the time.', 'Though the Special Edition features several improvements, there remain a number of unresolved issues. For starters, it still takes far too long for your troops to recover from battle wounds, especially when they are low-level units. This means that for every minor skirmish you fight, you often have to rest for three or four days just to get your grunts back into fighting trim. While you rest, your AI opponents are building bigger fortunes and bigger, more-powerful armies.', 'Of course, the computer faiths may just have an advantage because they all seem to begin the game with armies that are at least twice as powerful as yours. They also seem to begin with more gold, more crystals, and more ale - all for no apparent reason.', 'Catching up to the AI requires that you take over your fair share of mines and breweries, but that is a nearly impossible task in the early going. In general, there seem to be fewer first- and second-level caves near your starting city, regardless of your faith. This means that you have to attack higher-level monsters earlier than you should. As a result, it is very difficult to keep your troops alive, let alone develop them into seasoned veterans.', 'And even unit advancement seems to have been slowed considerably. Troops often go through numerous battles - against higher-level foes - without gaining enough experience to move up a level. The final result of all these minor issues is that the game is far more difficult now, even on the easiest difficulty setting.', ""Real-time combat certainly doesn't help matters much. In fact, apart from adding multilevel dungeons and buildings for the combat mode, this aspect of the game doesn't seem to have changed much. It is still difficult to see all of your units clearly when they fight the enemy at close quarters. More to the point, it's extremely difficult to target the enemy units in these situations. This wouldn't be a huge problem except for the fact that your units often stand there doing nothing after they kill off their initial targets - whether or not there happen to be enemy units nearby. Troops still get hung up on the scenery, so real-time battles are still the same old micromanagement madness that they have always been."", 'Then there\'s the minor issue of defeating one of the other lords in battle. You might think that by defeating another faith\'s leader - and thereby eliminating them from the game (at least as far as Balkoth\'s goals of conquest are concerned) - you would have made your life a bit easier. But no. As soon as you fell your colleague, vast armies of his faith will pour into your lands, hurling themselves against your forces until they eventually overwhelm and destroy you. I wouldn\'t find this ""feature"" so odious if not for the fact that the same courtesy is unavailable to you (when your character dies, the game is over).', 'The Special Edition corrects a number of flaws and adds several new features but somehow ends up being only a tiny bit more appealing than its predecessor. For those players who enjoyed the original game, the many enhancements in the Special Edition probably make it a must-have. But for the rest of us, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic II (and soon III) and Warlords III are simply better options for a fantasy-strategy fix. <i>--Michael E.

There's no attempt at realism here; it's arcade racing at its best. Graphics are incredibly smooth, with no distance pop-up, and the background details are splendid--the cityscapes have a stark reality to them and the 360-degree loops are a joy to behold (if a little stomach turning). There's plenty here to keep the average arcade racing fan happy--extra gadgets for your chosen vehicle and increased capacity engines, tyres and more are all there for the taking and all help to speed the player through the game to the point where the really groovy effects kick in. With a bike that's boosted to the hilt, hitting the turbo button produces an utterly stunning effect; the screen distorts as you hit high G and the sound goes woozy, waving in and out of phase to simulate the effect of raw speed. It's really very impressive. Add to this the novelty of the side-by-side two player mode and Extreme G3 is great fun and good value for money. --Chris Russell""]",Acclaim,"['>#12,119 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#312 in Video Games > More Systems > PlayStation 2 > Games']",,Video Games,B00005KCMG

Players steer Bilbo Baggins through places like Mirkwood Forest and Lonely Mountain, battling trolls and collecting gems for courage and health. The graphics are cartoony (like <i>Zelda</i>), but this doesn't take away from the game. We tested the Game Cube version, and found it to be very rich, with eleven different areas to explore.  Strengths include a design that is really easy to either zoom through, or take more time and explore. For example, in the first level, all you need to do is fix a bridge and find a walking stick, and you're done. But you can take much more time and explore if you want to. The only thing we'd fix is to add a running mode -- Bilbo is a little slow at times, and our 16 year old seasoned tester found some of the puzzles really tough.

It\'s not one of the best games ever, but you must give it props for a unique premise. Yes, this (Japanese-developed) Jaleco title explores the California phenomenon of lowrider cars. For the few of you not familiar, lowriders are modified classic cars equipped with hydraulic suspension systems that allow drivers to make their vehicle hop with switches (for further information, see any number of early &#8216;90s gangsta rap videos).</P> <P>And hop you will! Unfortunately, that\'s about all you\'ll do. The gameplay uses a timed-button-press mechanic &#xE0; la <i>PaRappa the Rapper</i>, although it\'s not nearly as complex or fun. Just press triangle for front hop, X for back hops, and so on. Sometimes, you\'ll need to alternate buttons for front-to-backs or side-to-sides or bed dances. Despite the mind-numbing repetition, I was compelled to continue, if only because I became quite obsessed with buying new decals and accessories for my lowrider. For this reason, I actually enjoyed this game more than any I\'ve ever scored a five out of ten.

Unreal Tournament 2003,,[],"['Video Games', 'Mac', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The stakes are high. On the one hand, fame, fortune, glory; on the other hand, death. Prove your skill in the arenas of the future, leading your team of computer-controlled ""bots"" to victory in the Grand Tournament, or compete with the best of the best via LAN or the Internet in seat-of-your-pants battles. <P> While <i>Unreal Tournament</i> offers the finest in classic ""Deathmatch"" play, right out of the box you can compete in Team Deathmatch or Capture the Flag. Control strategic points on the map to rack up your score in Domination, or test your skills in Assault, as one team defends its base from the other. Each game type comes with its own special maps and rules, for never-ending variety and challenge. Add gameplay mutators such as Jump Match or InstaGib, and <i>Unreal Tournament</i> will keep your wits honed to a razor edge. <P> Sure, playing games online can be a whole lotta\' fun and whatnot, but what if you\'re not interested in setting up an Internet account? What if you\'re not that good at first person shooters and you\'d like a chance to hone your skills off-line, in a less threatening environment? What if you\'re a Frag King who doesn\'t feel like being delayed by the time required to dial into an ISP? Well, you\'re in luck! <i>Unreal</i> shipped with a game mode called ""Botmatch"" in which you played Deathmatch games against computer-controlled opponents, called ""Bots."" <i>Unreal Tournament</i> takes the Bot Concept to the next level, providing single players with Bots that are fully ready to play with you or against you in anyone of the <i>Unreal Tournament</i>\'s very cool gameplay modes. <P> And lest you think that the artificial intelligence (A.I.) driving the actions of your Bot teammates and/or opponents is of the amateur variety, think again. Thanks to Epic\'s unmatched AI coding wizardry, <i>Unreal Tournament</i>\'s Bots are more life like than any computer controlled characters to date. They understand each game\'s unique rules. They have a firm handle (no pun intended) on all the different weapons at their disposal and how best to use them. You won\'t believe how effortlessly and skillfully <i>Unreal Tournament</i>\'s Bots utilize every nook and cranny of each level. No getting caught in corners or on stairs. They can swim, use elevators, climb stairs, and put on Toxin suits if they have to. If they\'re on your team, they can take your orders. If you\'re fighting a team of Bots, they\'ll be giving each other orders. They even insult you if play poorly. But that\'s not all! <P> If you\'re brand new to the world of first person, team-based games and are thinking to yourself, ""Assault? Domination? Capture the Flag? I don\'t know how to play those!,"" don\'t worry about it. <i>Unreal Tournament</i> includes comprehensive and fun tutorials for each of its gameplay modes. Designed from the ground up to make the learning process fun, you\'ll be wishing that EVERYTHING you had to learn was taught like this! <P> Rather than simply jumping into a mindless frenzy of Bot-fueled mayhem, <i>Unreal Tournament</i> actually provides you with a REASON to play. You and your team of Bots are fighting in a Tournament to attain the crown of Unreal Grand Master. The teams against which you\'ll be playing are comprised of the most ruthless scum the galaxy has to offer. You\'ll have to be cool under fire and keep your team working effectively if you hope to beat each of <i>Unreal Tournament</i>\'s 32 levels and come out the champion (or alive, for that matter). <P> Just because <i>UT</i> ships with an almost unbelievably realistic single player experience doesn\'t mean its forgotten about those of you with modems who like to go online for your fragging fun. Rest assured, if you\'ve got a modem and a copy of <i>Unreal Tournament</i>, you\'re going to have a LOT of fun. And the best part is this: you can be up and fragging on the server of your choice with a couple of mouse clicks. <P> No painstaking network configurations. No need to go download and install endless skin packs or levels if you\'re going to a server with user-made content. <i>Unreal Tournament</i>\'s unparalleled networking code makes it as easy as ""One, Two, uh, Die"" to play the game against anyone, anytime. If the server you\'re jumping to has unique content, UT will automatically download and install that content in REAL TIME, as you\'re connecting to the game. And thanks to Epic Games\'s amazing work on <i>Unreal Tournament</i>\'s network play, you can be sure that even a 33.6K modem can get you a silky smooth connection to the server of your choosing. Want more? Okay! <P> For the ultimate in multiplayer frag-adociousness, how about squaring off in teamplay against one of your friends. ""One?"" you say. That\'s right: you and a team of Bots vs. your friend a team of Bots. Or, if you\'re more of a traditional gameplayer, just use <i>Unreal Tournament</i>\'s built-in server finder (Ubrowser) to find a game populated by real people and join in. The possibilities are almost limitless; these are just a few of examples of how you can leverage UT\'s amazing network capabilities and its skin-crawlingly realistic artificial intelligence. <P> Playing team-based or one-one games isn\'t all that different from the ""analog"" versions you used to play as a kid: there are a set of rules and clearly stated objectives. The big difference with <i>Unreal Tournament</i>, of course, is that you can blow up the flag carrier (for example) rather than simply tackling him or her. Which is always nice. Take a look below for the different rules and objectives governing the play of <i>Unreal Tournament</i>\'s unparalleled offering of games. <P> Tournament Deathmatch / Tournament Team Deathmatch: When you think of online, multiplayer gaming, this is what you\'re probably thinking of. It\'s every man for himself in these non-stop fragfests. He who hits the pre-set frag limit first or who has the most kills at the end of the match wins. For extra fun, try a little team deathmatch. Join a team (made of either humans or Bots) and battle it out with another team that comprised of either Bots and/or humans, for the max number of total kills. <P> Last Man Standing: This is Deathmatch\'s kissin\' cousin. Each player (or team, if you\'re playing Team Last Man Standing) starts with a certain number; for the purposes of this example, let\'s say that number is 10. Every time you get killed, you get a number subtracted from your total number or your team\'s total number. When you hit ""0,"" you\'re out. The object is to be the last one with any kills left. <P> Capture the Flag (CTF): You remember it from when you were a kid. And if you\'ve been playing first person shooters for a while, then you\'re familiar with its digital equivalent. The concept is simple: you enter the game as either a member of the blue team or the red team. Your mission? To capture the other team\'s flag and return it to your base. Whether you\'re playing against Bots or human opponents, this game epitomizes WHY team games are fun. You\'ll need people defending your base, taking the offense out, and still others making attempts for the flag. Play it once and you\'ll be instantly addicted.']","by

Military bases, laboratories and downtown Los Angeles are just a few of the more than 20 unique locations found in the game, which have been taken straight from the current Terminator timeline of events. In addition, more than 20 futuristic and modern-day weapons are at the player's disposal for use in terminating any enemy in the most efficient manner possible, including the SkyNet Arc-Laser, Tech-Com Micro Rocket Launcher and the AR-15 Assault Rifle with M202 Grenade Launcher. <P> Terminators are designed to utilize the most readily and efficient means available to eliminate any particular foe--when that enemy is a Terminator this leads to absolutely brutal hand-to-hand combat. <i>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</i> will allow player's to engage in true movie-like Terminator combat as they repeatedly face the ultimate killing machine, the T-X, throughout the single-player game. Smashing opponents into walls, massive two-handed chops and crushing kicks are just a few of the dozens of moves in the Terminator's arsenal. <P> A unique twist in the <i>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</i> story will also allow players to operate the Terminator before it was reprogrammed in the future to save John Connor. As a result, players will be able to test their terminating skills against battle-hardened Tech Com special forces from the future as they fight alongside and utilize SkyNet's advanced weaponry, including Future Killer tanks and flyers, fixed gun emplacements as well as other Terminators in an effort to crush the last remnants of humankind.""]","by

For example, the player jumps from a ramp, and performs a Superman (Big Air trick). \n\nThere are a total of four game modes. The first six levels are all 'challenge-based'. The player must complete specific goals in order to advance to the next. The six, and final levels are 'competition-based' levels, where the player is judged on their performance in a number of timed runs.\n\nProquest\nProquest is the main mode of the game, and could also be called 'Career mode'. The player chooses one of the riders and seeks to progress through all the levels of the game, in a series of two minute runs. The first six levels are completed by finishing all the set challenges within them, and the competition levels can only be cleared when the player finishes a run worthy of winning the contest. Once the player finishes each successive level, they will receive new bikes (a total of four to buy) and clothing, and eventually upon completion of the game, videos of Dave Mirra and Ryan Nyquist and special cheat codes (depending on the character chosen).\n\nFreeride\nA mode where the player can freely ride any level that has been unlocked in the Proquest mode. There is no time limit, so the real aim of the mode is to allow full and unrestricted exploration of the level to find the best spots to score and to practice performing tricks.""]","by

Experience multiple ways to complete your objectives&#151;from brute force to spy-like subtleties&#151;and save the world from untold terror!"", '<P>Is there such a thing as a franchise that\'s too bankable? If there is, perhaps James Bond is it. It\'s an almost guaranteed seller, which is perhaps the reason that EA\'s last entry in the series, James Bond 007: NightFire, seemed to be cruising on autopilot. Sure, it was fun and breezy &#8211; I really liked it at the time &#8211; but it didn\'t really offer much in terms of depth or novel concepts. It almost felt like the development team had become a little too comfortable with its standard mix of FPS, track shooting, and driving.</P> <P>Perhaps sensing that ennui was setting in, EA boldly chucked its 007 blueprint and opted to craft Everything or Nothing as a third-person action/adventure. Given that the last time Bond went third person, Tomorrow Never Dies, was an out-and-out disaster, this game represents a pretty big risk for the conservative gang at EA. Does it pay off? For the most part, the answer is yes.</P> <P>One of the big things this title brings to the table is Bond\'s rappel gun, which is used frequently and adds a nice dimension of verticality to the levels. It\'s pretty cool to be storming down the side of a building, dodging explosions and capping enemies with glee. In another instance, you\'ll forgo the rappel altogether, and jump off the side of a cliff in order to save a plummeting damsel.</P> <P>It\'s these sequences that really made Everything or Nothing for me. While the basic third-person shooting is well and good, EoN supplies the flashy, over-the-top stunts that one expects from the Bond films. I was satisfied with the old FPS-action, but this new format gives EoN a bombastic panache and a tremendous amount of variety. Whether you\'re running roughshod over a Central American city in a tank, using some of the cool gadgets like the spider bot, or trying to drive your motorcycle onto a moving plane before it takes off, EoN has a wicked sense of daring and a brass set of balls.</P> <P>This is a Hollywood blockbuster in every sense of the word, and features some of the biggest star power ever seen in a game. Including Monty Python alum John Cleese as Q, Maxim favorite Shannon Elizabeth, professional creep Willem Dafoe, and Pierce Brosnan, this is a truly A-list cast. It\'s even more significant for the fact that this is an adventure unique to video games, not based on any movie project. If you still doubt that gaming is growing larger than the movie industry, here\'s further&nbsp;proof.</P> <P>Despite its daring, varied design and big-time production values, it\'s not perfect. There are frequent problems with camera view, and the auto-targeting vacillates between adequate and maddening. However, good games can make you overlook their flaws, and on this count Everything or Nothing is a success. Is it the next great evolution of gaming? Perhaps not, but it is a step towards creating the ultimate James Bond title.</P> <P>The Edge</P> <P>Although Electronic Arts does a good job of making sure its multi-system games are pretty comporably across all three platforms, there are always advantages to certain consoles. Unsurprisingly, the Xbox EoN looks the best, althought it\'s not pushing the limits of the hardware. On PS2, there isn\'t as much graphical degradation as you might expect, and the four shoulders are handy in many situations. So, let\'s call these two a draw, which brings us to the GameCube. Nitendo definitely comes in third here, mostly due to the lack of buttons. On Xbox and PS2, you have separate buttons for hugging the wall and crouch. On the \'Cube, both moves are done with the Z-button, which sometimes means you crouch when you want to hug.<BR><BR><B>Concept:</B><BR>Out with FPS, in with over-the-top third-person adventuring <BR><BR><B>Graphics:</B><BR>Not an award-winner, but as solid as you expect from an EA product <BR><BR><B>Sound:</B><BR>Mya\'s Bond theme is even worse than Madonna\'s; but it does feature a great score and tons of celeb voiceovers <BR><BR><B>Playability:</B><BR>The usual complaints (camera, auto-aim) don\'t detract too much from the experience <BR><BR><B>Entertainment:</B><BR>It\'s good to see EA taking chances with this property again <BR><BR><B>Replay:</B><BR>Moderate <BR><BR>Rated: <B>8.5 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Matt Helgeson</B><BR>Issue: <B>March 2004</B><BR><BR><B>2nd Opinion:</B><BR> Bond\'s new video game adventure was a lot more enjoyable for me than his last few cinematic outings. Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist? Who thought that was a good idea? While Shannon Elizabeth may not be an acting juggernaut, Everything or Nothing still feels like it could have worked on the big screen. The frequent switches in action keep it moving along at a nice pace and make it hard to put down. I especially like some of the more creative action stages, such as the free fall down the side of the cliff. The third-person shooting levels which make up the meat of the game are fun and work pretty well on Xbox and PS2, although the GameCube controls came up a bit short. While I preferred playing this title on the Xbox, it\'s a solid release on all three systems, and it\'s a great chance to see Bond in an adventure that\'s (a little) less ridiculous than most of his recent missions.<BR><BR>Rated: <B>8.75 out of 10</B><BR>Editor: <B>Jeremy Zoss</B><BR><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0""></a><BR><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Up to 32 people can get in on the multiplayer game modes -- fight on Earth or in space, as a Breed or human soldier', '', ""Once, I had high hopes for Breed. In fact, if it gets a patch that fixes all of the broken bits (of which there are many), it may be a decent game someday. The ideas are sound, even original, but they're also all implemented very poorly. I can't think of a single element of this title that works well, and several don't work at all."", ""In Breed you control a squad of space marines, among whom you can switch on the fly, but their AI when you're not controlling them makes them worse than useless. They don't just get stuck, they also jump off of cliffs and waste precious sniper ammo in close combat. This is especially disheartening once you realize that level design in Breed mainly consists of two things: Emplaced guns you must snipe from far away or die, and hordes of identical enemies to be mowed down. Run out of sniper ammo, and the mission is all but lostjust one of those mounted weapons can tear your force apart in disgustingly short order if left operational."", ""Vehicles are present in some missions and help to spice up the gameplay, but driving them is generally less effective than being on footespecially since your squad can't join you on them. Weapons are similarly disappointing. Not only do they sound wimpy, but the alien energy weapons you capture are so worthless you can't help but wonder how they took over the Earth in the first place. The human weapons are named strangely, but they behave exactly the same as the standard FPS rifles, shotguns, and such."", ""There are some exciting moments in Breed, where you really feel like you're humanity's last bulwark against extinction by hostile aliens. Surmounting the insane odds you're put up against is a great feeling, and some parts of the environments are destructible it's pretty awesome the first few times you collapse a tower on top of some aliens' heads. These fleeting seconds of brilliance, however, are nowhere near enough to make me forgive the problems that plague this game."", 'Normally I try to refrain from commenting on stability issues, since they\'re almost always different from PC to PC, but Breed forces me to. On any of the three machines at GI\'s top-secret headquarters, it was a miracle if Breed went 15 minutes without crashing to desktop.

The environments are huge, but they lack variety. The vehicles are plentiful, but the controls are often awkward. However, my biggest complaint has to be the AI. Enemies often lack the most basic common sense. And though you can switch between allied team members at will, the computer-controlled squad is woefully stupid. There are also some horrific technical glitches, which the developer would be wise to address in an early patch. Still, the game has some bracing action, and includes a driving, pulse-pounding soundtrack.<br /><br />Rated: <b>6.75 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Matt Miller</b><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0"" /></a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']","by

Welcome to <i>Wrath Unleashed</i>, a unique spin on a classic concept popularized by such favorites as <i>Archon</i> and <i>Battle Chess</i>. As an elemental god, you maneuver your armies across hexagonal tiles to control territory, and when an enemy moves into your domain, you defend it in one-on-one, fists blazing (literally) combat.', ""The strategy is what makes this game. Each tile on the grid is infused with the power of one of the traditional four elements that can give your units an advantage in combat.

Tread Marks is not a tank simulation, and while some elements of the game world are realistic, the focus is on fun and ease of gameplay.\n\nAre two main game modes in Tread Marks, Race and Battle Match (Deathmatch). In Race mode, tanks race through checkpoints around an off-road race course, picking up weapons and power-ups, with the object of the game being to place first in the race. Tanks can\'t be destroyed in a Race, but can have their turrets blown off. If that happens they won\'t be able to use any weapons until their turret comes back, which occurs once the tank\'s health reaches 100%. In Battle Match, tanks can be destroyed, and object is free-for-all carnage. Tanks spawn in random locations on the map, and can drive anywhere to pick up weapons and waste opponents.\n\nThe primary single-player game experience is the Ladder Race mode, where competition is in a ladder-style ranking system against 99 computer- driven opponents of varying skill levels. The better the skill in each race, the higher the Rank becomes Will naturally settle into a Rank that is appropriate for particular skill level, which will provide an optimal level of challenge in each race. \n\nIncludes weaponry such as Bolt-On weapons, Swarmer Pack, MRL Launcher, Concussion Missile, Dirt Ball, Machine Gun, Plasma Gun, Rocket Grenades, Laser, Avenger and Plasma Mines, Cruise Missiles, Heavy Flamer, Mass Driver, and more.

So says the <i>Temple of Doom</i> movie poster, and--Lara Croft notwithstanding--Indiana Jones is still synonymous with glory, romance, treasure, and adventure. Previous Indiana Jones games were produced by the graphic-adventure game masters at LucasArts. This latest installment is an action-oriented romp made by the Collective, the same development house that produced the critically acclaimed <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> for Xbox. The <i>Buffy</i> game engine is a good fit for Indy, as he travels the world on a quest to prevent the discovery of an ancient Chinese secret that could spell the end of creation itself.', 'Such a quest should be easy for an adventurer like Indy, and with game controls that are as well laid out as these, it is easy. Indy can run, jump, shimmy up ropes, swing with his whip, and duke it out with nasty villains. True to the movies, Indy also has to navigate an almost constant stream of deathtraps. Caves full of traps, ruins full of traps, medieval castles filled with traps, and guess what you find in China, yes, more traps. It gets repetitive, but the game has some clever tricks in its floppy hat. For example, skulls make noise, so Indy can toss a few and watch crocodiles target them instead of him.', ""Indy can execute quick punch combinations to knock his foes out, or he can pick up weapons such as a chair, plank of wood, machete, or firearm. His famous whip can be used to disarm foes. The only problem is the camera, which is difficult to keep in the right position--you have complete control of it, but it's hard to manage a camera while you're fighting a martial arts expert, a Nazi with a gun, or a poacher keen on decapitating Indy."", ""The graphics are good, pleasantly reminding you of some of the movies' more memorable locales. The in-game Indy mug looks like Harrison Ford down to the chin scar. Other nice touches include how Indy has to actually pick up his hat if it falls off during a fight, and the little '30s plane flying over the aged and weathered world map. The music is pure John Williams, and the voice work is handled by convincing imitators. The guy they got for Indy, in particular, sounds a lot like Ford himself. Sadly no other movie characters of note appear in the game. (I was looking for John Rhys-Davies at least, because he seems to be in every video game that comes out.)"", ""<i>Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb</i> does right by its license and provides hours of entertainment for anyone who's ever wanted to relive the movies starring the most exciting adventurer alive.
