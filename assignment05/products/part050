If you succeed in knocking down all of his op-\nponents before the replacements arrive, you advance a scoring level.\nThis increases the point value of each opponent hit.

NATIONAL TREASURE 2 Book Of Secrets UMD PSP Movie ^^,,[],"['Video Games', 'Kids & Family', 'Sony PSP', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Less engrossing than its 2004 predecessor National Treasure, Jon Turteltaubs busy sequel National Treasure: Book of Secrets is nevertheless a colorful and witty adventure, another race against overwhelming odds for the answer to a historical riddle. Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage), the treasure hunter who feverishly sought, in the first film, the whereabouts of a war chest hidden by Americas forefathers, is now charged with protecting family honor. When a rival (Ed Harris) offers alleged proof that Gates ancestor, Thomas Gates, was not a Civil War-era hero but a participant in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Ben and his father (Jon Voight) and crew (Justin Bartha, Diane Kruger) hopscotch through Paris, London, Washington DC, and South Dakota to gather evidence refuting the claim. The film is most fun when the hunt, as in National Treasure, squeezes Ben into such impossible situations as examining twin desks in the queens chambers in Buckingham Palace and the White Houses Oval Office, or kidnapping an American president (Bruce Greenwood) for a few minutes of frank talk. Helen Mirren, the previous year's Oscar winner for Best Actress, wisely joins the cast of a likely hit film as Bens archaeologist mother, long-estranged from Voights character but as feisty as the rest of the family. Returning director Turteltaub takes excellent advantage of his colorful backdrops in European capitals and the always-eerie Mount Rushmore, and oversees some wildly imaginative sets for this dramedys feverish third act in an audacious and completely unexpected, legendary setting. If National Treasure: Book of Secrets doesnt feel quite as crisp and unique as its predecessor, it is still ingenious and wry enough to laugh a bit at itself. --Tom Keogh""]","by

With the help of his spaceship, Haley, he travels through space literally dusting off stars. The problem is that Haley, not being the most reliable means of transportation, has broken down. Now Starsweep needs help getting the craft into working order again. To do this Starsweep must gather as much stardust as possible, which Haley runs on. This is a big job, but thankfully Starsweep has built a useful and quirky robot named Wishfinder. Among other features, Wishfinder possesses a built in ""treasurescope"" that can be used to track down stardust anywhere it exists. But there is more than stardust out in space. There is also seemingly unlimited treasure. Exactly how much is meant by ""unlimited?"" Join Starsweep and Wishfinder as they discover just how much that is in <i>Treasure World</i>. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> What makes <i>Treasure World</i> unique is its focus on mobile play through the wealth of Wi-Fi hotspots available around the world. The game contains more than 2,500 separate in-game items/treasure such as trees, flowers, candy, outfits, plants, etc., which are automatically unlocked as players access the more than 200 million Wi-Fi treasure spots worldwide that are registered within the game. Only a certain number of these items are accessible from a single Wi-Fi hotspot. This means that although the game can be played from a single location, players must take their DS with them wherever they go and access new Internet connections in order to continue to collect new items. Once players have a sufficient amount of items they can be used to decorate in-game environments. In addition, certain items also have musical qualities. Each of these have specific sounds associated with them and can be placed on the ground where individual sounds can be heard, scales can played and tones changed. The game also features preset ""songscapes,"" basically in-game songs associated with an environment, which draw on the sounds of a set number of items associated with these environments. When players acquire all the items associated with a songscape a melody becomes available to the player. Also, a variety of human and animal themed outfits discovered by players can be used to dress up Starsweep\'s robot Wishfinder and the Stardust unlocked at each new Wi-Fi treasure spot accessed will help move your spaceship along as well. <p/> <b>Online Sharing</b><br/> With more than 2,500 items available via multiple Wi-Fi spots, playing by themselves it will take players a good while to collect all the treasure available, but online sharing is another way to experience the wealth of content available is <i>Treasure World</i>. Through the game\'s companion Website Clubtreasureworld.com players can share and trade items, songscapes and favorite Wi-Fi treasure spots, as well as chat with other players and keep up to date on game news. <p/> <b>Key Features</b><br/> <ul> <li>Explore and discover Wi-Fi signals in the real world that will unlock thousands of treasures in the game, and use these treasures to create your own customized world.</li> <li>Treasures encompass numerous themes and appeal to boys, girls and gamers of all ages.</li> <li>Use your imagination to dress up a character that is uniquely yours &ndash; choose from over 100 character sets like Ninja, Panda, Anime, Sports, Feline and so much more.</li> <li>Add some melody to your world and create a musical masterpiece with every treasure you collect.

I will set up a studio for myself here. I have not been able to find the star key, but it appears I first have to look for nine fragments. Near the railway line, I found a box to collect the fragments in. Some entrances to some of the buildings could be opened, but at the moment, I can't make any further progress... In a straw-roofed hut, there is a fireplace where some missing parts can be joined together. I'll lock the hut again but will leave behind clues about how to open the door... An unexpected success! By chance, I discovered the key to a cave system where there is yet another gate with a star lock.

You move your mouse, joystick, wheel, gamepad, etc., and that device communicates a signal to the PC or console. Communication back to you could only come from the display (PC monitor or TV) or from speakers.', 'Tactile feedback adds technology to control devices that allows them to communicate to you as well. Today, the two primary types of tactile feedback for control devices are vibration feedback and force-feedback.', '<b>About Vibration Feedback</b><br> Vibration feedback works on the same principles as the vibration mode in your mobile phone or pager, but is typically much more sophisticated. It can be used to communicate specific ideas or sensations. The effects can range from a simple buzz that serves as an alert or confirmation, to a slower rhythmic motion that simulates vibrations from an approaching train, to a single, strong jolt that simulates a collision.', 'However, vibration feedback cannot resist your movement, assist it, or provide any directional movement or information. Because they are much simpler, vibration feedback devices tend to be much less expensive than force-feedback devices.', '<b>About Force Feedback</b><br> Force-feedback is a more sophisticated technology and provides people with very realistic tactile feedback. It has been widely used for some time in medical, space and flight simulators to provide lifelike training for students and professionals who make split-second decisions based not just on sight and sound, but also on their sense of touch.', 'This cutting-edge technology has been extended to PC and next-generation console gaming over the last five years, and is now coming to the Nintendo GameCube. Force-feedback is substantially more rich, realistic and engaging than the non-directional vibration feedback to which many gamers are accustomed. Through the use of advanced software and electronics, force-feedback can move a steering wheel, joystick, or mouse as if the device were subject to real external forces.', 'Force-feedback devices include one or more motors plus additional mechanical and electrical components and are capable of a wide variety of effects. Force-feedback can resist your movement, or assist it, and is capable of providing specific directional movement and information. And it can also provide sophisticated vibration.', 'Logitech Profiler software for PC: <ul> <li>Customize button functionality: Every game is different, and so is every gamer. We know that.

One group of these kids, who name themselves the ""Bakugan Battle Brawlers"" and who are led by Dan, find that the cards also serve as a link to a parallel dimension known as Vestroia. Here they discover that the game and its monsters that they are dedicated to mastering is tied to an imbalance of positive and negative energy in Vestroia.

The game is something of a cross between marbles and a live action card game. To get started you\'ll first need to enter your name, select an attribute and create your character. Then you\'ll be ready to explore the world of <i>Bakugan</i>. If you can\'t wait to start battling your friends, then head straight to the Battle Arena, but if you want to be the best you have to learn the rules. The goal of <i>Bakugan: Battle Brawlers</i> is to win the game by collecting three ""gate cards."" Gate cards are collected by winning battles against opponents. As a starting move each player sets down one metallic gate card. Then you\'re ready to roll your Bakugan, which is in the form of a ball. After throwing you can steer your Bakugan around the environment so that it lands on the perfect card and collects powerups. The aim is to get your Bakugan to stand on a card, and that happens when they roll over it slowly. Once the Bakugan stands, it will transform into Battle Mode. Now you\'re ready to battle. A battle begins when two Bakugan from different players stand on the same gate card. The gate card then opens and both bakugan transform into Monster Mode, and are ready to fight. The gate card can add ""G-Power"" to a Bakugan according to its world attribute (color) and can also change the rules of the battle. Players can also boost their G-power by doing well in battle.

Blast Radius,,['Factory Sealed'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['Factory Sealed', ""What do you get when you have the Colony Wars series, take out the backbreaking mission requirements, and throw in a lot more arcade-style blasting action? You get Blast Radius, that's what. Assuming the role of Kayne, you are the last remaining member of the recently eliminated Wolf Squadron. Conveniently for your employment situation, the Vorn, a gentle race currently under siege by the horrible advances of the nasty Kotan-Kai, implore you to aid them in their time of need. In return, you get to fly the Vorn's most advanced craft and weapons (why they couldn't do it themselves is beyond me) as you hurl yourself into battle against these worthy opponents. <P>In Blast Radius, you can choose from nine different assault vehicles of varying appearances, abilities, and weapons. Your streamlined HUD displays the various attributes your craft is currently equipped with: primary weapon, radar, ammo, turbo, lock-on laser info, and fuel. There is a lock-on cursor and targeting arrow that point you to your nearest enemy. Other optional weapons include torpedoes, rockets, seeker missiles, locking lasers, and fusion nukes for eye-shattering explosions and high-powered attacks.  <P>It will be apparent to veterans of the Colony Wars series that Blast Radius seems just like Colony Wars. While that's not a bad thing - and the action definitely seems to be the drawing point here - it just seems more like an expansion pack than anything else. You fly through the semi-uncharted reaches of space while attempting to down as many hostile craft as you can. If you haven't already gotten Colony Wars: Vengeance yet, and you are thinking about buying it, Blast Radius is an alternative you might want to consider because of its easier learning curve. That's not to say that the enemy ships are a cakewalk; it's just that the mission requirements rely less on nearly impossible tasks than on straightforward dogfights.  <P>The game uses the Colony Wars engine, ensuring that the action moves at a smooth pace and that the control is dead-on. The ship and battle-cruiser models seem to be more brightly colored than the ships in Colony Wars, making it easier for you to spot your enemy far off on the horizon. Weapons and weapon effects are predictably spectacular, being trademark psygnosis. The only downside is the ship design, which looks mostly ham-fisted and awkward. You'd imagine the most advanced ships of the future (or distant galaxies) to be the sexiest, most streamlined fighters you've ever seen. Instead - and this goes for Colony Wars' ships too - the designs are clumsy and often seem forced. It's not too exciting to fly something that looks like a big horseshoe or stapler while fighting the scourge of the universe. In its defense, the sound is super, with ship buzzing all around you, and lasers and explosions causing considerable neighbor-waking noise. Adding to the carnage is the link-cable option. If you have a friend with his own PlayStation, his own copy of Blast Radius, and a link cable, you can hook up for cooperative play or face off against each other in deathmatch mode. This should provide many high-speed intergalactic battles, should you meet the requirements. <P>So, while Blast Radius tends to feel a bit like a throwaway or, rather, it feels as though the company is simple cashing-in on its own success, it is nevertheless a worthwhile way to kill some time. If you liked Colony Wars and are looking for more of the same high-quality space-shooting action, Blast Radius is going to be your best option. Whether it's worth a purchase largely depends on how much you really need it. A rental might be your first move. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

In a Grudge Match, the player must fight against a CPU controlled clone of his or her fighter. The first person to get 3 ""knockdowns"" wins the Grudge Match. This match plays more like a bonus round, in that it doesn\'t have to be won for the player to continue through the game.\n\nThe final battle, the ""Championship Match"", is between the player and the mysterious entity that taunts between matches every once in a while, the Masked Warrior. If more than one person is playing the game before this match, they must fight each other to the death until only one becomes victorious and can fight him.\n\nThe player must jump, punch, and kick their opponent until his/her energy runs out. If the player presses all three of the buttons at a time, the character will perform a ""super move"".\n\nSometimes during matches the player will come across foreign objects such as knives, crates, sticks, motorcycles, and bar stools that can be thrown at you or your opponent. The player may also come across a power-up known as the ""power pill"". If the player or the opponent grab this item, one will become temporarily stronger and take less damage from hits.\n\nSometimes even the crowd will interfere in the fights. Two characters, known as Knife Man and Knife Woman, will come out of the crowd and stab the player with their daggers. The player can take these nuisances out with one hit.']","by

Built around two-player cooperative action, the accessible controls and family-friendly gameplay bring Star Wars fans across generations together like never before to fight the evil Separatists and restore peace to the galaxy. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Gameplay in <i>Star Wars the Clone Wars: Republic Heroes</i> is mission-based. Players can choose to approach the action as either a Jedi or a clone class character. Playing as a Jedi you have access to eight playable characters, and as a clone you play as one of a group of clones. The game was developed with co-op play in mind, which means players can more or less count on never fighting alone, which is a good thing considering the hordes of battle droids and other enemies you will face. The game also features a puzzle-solving gameplay component, as well as an upgrade system based on the collection of ""Force Orbs"" scattered throughout the game environment. <p/> <b>Weapons and Combat</b><br/> Keeping with the games\' user friendly approach, the control scheme has been designed with Jedi character\'s lightsaber and force powers, as well as clone characters firing trigger accessible from a single input source. Because of the difference in the character classes weapons, combat differs depending on the class chosen. Due to their reliance on the their lightsabers, Jedi will mostly engage enemies at close range, although force power attacks can allow for more distance from targets. In addition, utilizing Jedi powers at point blank range players are able to engage in ""droidjacking,"" which allows a Jedi to take control of a droid\'s weapons system and other abilities. On the other hand, clone character combat relies more on firepower, utilizing a variety of blaster type weapons and thermal grenades, although clones are able to acquire heavier weapons, such as miniguns and rocket launchers as the game progresses. Because of the projectile nature of these weapons clone character combat can be fought as a variety of distances. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Experience an all-new and exciting Clone Wars storyline that bridges the gap between season one and two of the TV series as you learn more about the mysterious bounty hunter Cad Bane and hunt down the all-new Skakoan super villain Kul Teska.</li> <li>Play as your favorite Jedi heroes including Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, Mace Windu, and Kit Fisto.</li> <li>Slice and dice your way through Separatist droids with your lightsaber and Force powers and use your agility to perform amazing leaps and navigate levels filled with interactivity.</li> <li>Turn your enemies into weapons as you commandeer droids and use their unique abilities to blast enemies and solve puzzles as a Jedi.</li> <li>Be part of an elite clone trooper squad with unique gameplay that puts firepower at your fingertips.

With big hits and sweet fakes, <i>NHL 2000</i> delivers nonstop hockey action from the first slap of the stick.

Pick up and play with the tutorial level, or take a team from the cellar to the Stanley Cup in the new Dynasty mode. This game will allow you to take the shots, and deliver the hits.', 'NHL 2000 is an uninspired attempt at a portable hockey game. It seems that THQ got caught up in trying to jam-pack the cartridge with stats, options, and features, and it didn\'t spend enough time focusing on the gameplay. You can choose any of the 1999 NHL teams and compete in exhibition games, full seasons, race to the playoffs, or just enjoy competitive shootouts. You can edit your team lines, send players to the penalty box, and set a wide range of game options like two-line passes, icing, offsides, and the stringency of referees. Where the title falls short is in actually playing a game of hockey. It\'s hard enough to follow the puck on the tiny screen, but the game is subject to flicker, often making the puck vanish completely. Controlling the skaters is an exercise in patience and frustration because they don\'t go where you want them to, and you\'ll often find yourself controlling the wrong teammate. The traditional ""press B to switch to the player nearest the puck"" scheme doesn\'t work well either, as unresponsive characters often just watch the puck sail by. The speed-burst feature is useless - the responding player will instantly sprint across almost the entire rink, burying any hope of subtlety in a spray of snow. The sounds are nearly nonexistent, and the musical score only plays when the game is paused. The AI leaves much to be desired, with the CPU goalie often twitching spasmodically for up to five seconds after making a save; because the goalie won\'t pass the puck to a teammate and the referee won\'t blow the whistle, players are forced to ram the goalie to get the action going again. Although you have to give THQ credit for trying, NHL 2000 just doesn\'t work on the Game Boy. The developers should have spent more time tweaking and play testing it instead of laboriously transcribing the stats of the current NHL roster. Even hard-core hockey fans should avoid this title; it will start gathering dust on its first day of play.<i>--Doug Trueman</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Smarter player runs and improved passing physics will give you the opportunity for increased attack options. More intelligent defensive positioning ensures your team will not chase the play or sink too deep into your own third of the pitch.</li> <li><b>Individual Team Tactics</b> &ndash; Tailor the way your team plays based on 4 unique team styles. These tactics will allow you to change your style of play based on your opposition to create a more dynamic experience while exploiting weaknesses in their game. There are four different styles of play to choose from: long ball, counterattack, wing -play and passing soccer/slow buildup.</li> <li><b>Visual Improvements</b> &ndash; Updated player portraits, improved pitch details as well as 30 new star head models headline the visual improvement in <i>FIFA Soccer 10</i>. Coupled with updated front end menus which align with <i>FIFA Soccer 10</i>&rsquo;s menus on the Wii creating a distinctively unique Nintendo experience.</li> <li><b>Be-A-Pro: Club and Country</b> &ndash; The popular Be A Pro mode from last year has been revisited with numerous upgrades to make it an even deeper gaming experience. Create a customized pro or select a real life player who will compete in club matches and over 15 international friendlies to earn a spot on the national team and qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup squad. Another new addition is the inclusion of story based scenarios where you enter the game to complete specific objectives and build the experience of your Pro (i.e. enter a tie game as a half-time substitute).</li> <li><b>Coach Feedback System</b> &ndash; Learning to play professional soccer the correct way is even easier now with insight from your manager. Made up of three components, the Coach Feedback System will provide (1) a pre-match scouting report helping plan your attack against every opponent, (2) in-game advice utilizing the touch screen that will provide recommendations on how to adjust your strategy on the fly and (3) an end of match analysis with feedback on how well your team performed based on 8 different criteria of your play.</li> <li><b>Set-Piece Creator</b> &ndash; Adding another level of customization, the set piece creator will allow you to create, test and tweak custom set pieces, utilizing the Nintendo DS touch screen, that you can then save and use in real game situations.

These events encompass everything from motocross, supercross, omnicross and others and also feature a high level of trick completion, judged with several parameters in mind. Vehicles used in the races run the gamut from specific MX bikes, and ATVS, to super buggies and trucks. Gameplay in the dirt-covered environments faced require skill and guts to master. Along with the new Rhythm Racing 2.0 physics engine, <i>MX vs. ATV: Reflex</i> helps players achieve in these areas with a new control scheme, Rider Reflex. <p/> <b>Rider Reflex</b><br/> Build around dual control inputs, the Rider Reflex control scheme built into <i>MX vs. ATV: Reflex</i> is designed to revolutionize the way you race in several different ways. The first of these is by improving precision turning when you need it. With the analog stick at the left controlling the direction of the bike, and left and right shoulder buttons controlling the direction the rider leans, tighter and faster turns are possible by simultaneously directing both in the same direction, carving the player to a stop or changing direction in a instant, just as you would on a real bike. Similarly this ability to use the rider\'s weight, also impacts more subtle abilities to control a bike, both on the ground and in the air as the rider uses his weight to slow, or speed up his momentum at crucial times and change the angle of his bike to correct a bad takeoff But Rider Reflex is not just about steering. It also has a major role to play while while you are in the air, allowing players to pull off tricks like never before. There are several tricks possible, all of which will take some time to discover and master, but the basic trick performance mechanism is simple. To pull off a trick just hold down the triangle button, use the D-pad to select a trick and modify them for extra style using the left and right shoulder buttons. <p/> <b>Wreck Avoidance System</b><br/> No matter how sick attempted tricks might seem, they aren\'t worth much if you can\'t stick the landing. With this in mind <i>MX vs. ATV: Reflex</i> helps to get you back on the ground, safe and sound with a wreck avoidance system. In the event that players can\'t manage to use the Rider Reflex control system to right themselves as they come back to earth, this automatic system provides a last chance to avoid disaster by alerting you to your danger with an onscreen arrow as the ground rises to meet you. Players must quickly use the D-pad to match the direction of the arrow in order for the rider to regain his balance and keep on going. But expect to be challenged. If you are too slow you will wreck, and the harder the impact the less time you have to react. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Rider Reflex</b></li> <ul> <li>Battle for position with new independent rider and vehicle control.</li> <li>Wreck avoidance system lets you wrestle your ride back from the verge of catastrophe &ndash; if you can.</li> </ul> <li><b>Stunts</b></li> <ul> <li>Dual controls let you tear it up with death-defying stunts and high-flying freestyle action.</li> <li>Soar high above the course with over 30 freestyle tricks designed for the PSP.</li> </ul> <li><b>Vehicles</b> - Race all the fastest and fiercest MX bikes, ATVs, trucks, buggies and more.</li> <li><b>Multiplayer</b></li> <ul> <li>The mayhem never ends as you string together your own series of events.</li> <li>4-player multiplayer, both in ad hoc and infrastructure mode, lets you challenge your friends and brings players of all skill levels together with competitive mini-game.</li> </ul> <li><b>Courses and Terrain</b> - PSP version of <i>MX vs. ATV: Reflex</i> features the same courses as seen in the console versions.</li> </ul> <td> <tr> </table>']","by

Pool Hustler,,['Out-hustle 12 underground pool sharks in six distinct venues'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Games']",{},"['For anyone who\'s watched The Color of Money, the only reasons for playing pool for real are those with dead presidents on them. That quest for the Benjamins is the motivation behind Pool Hustler, an above-average pool simulation that\'s well-rounded if a bit light in the reflex-testing department. It should be noted that Pool Hustler offers a bit more than just playing for money. There\'s a great in-depth lesson mode to teach all aspects of pool, from aiming shots to jumping balls. A two-player mode offers 9-Ball, Rotation, 8-Ball, and 14-1 Continuous games. A trick-shot mode lets you execute 30 multiball trick shots. And there\'s also a very flexible practice mode. Still, it\'s the story mode that\'s the reason for playing, as you bet cash against computer players of progressively tougher skill levels. As you beat players at different pool games, additional stages are unlocked. One cool feature in the story mode is the random ""jeopardy"" bet, where the computer asks if you want to bet on a single shot. Since these are a bit spontaneous, the occurrences add a little spice to the gameplay. From a gameplay standpoint, this game tests the intellect and not reflexes, which is either a plus or minus depending on your point of view. All the shooting parameters - power, spin, angle - are determined first. Once you deem those settings OK, you press a button to execute the shot. This is unlike Backstreet Billiards and Virtual Pool 64, where some finger finesse/timing is required to win. As far as AI goes, the computer seems well able to pick the best shots, although foes tend to be easy to beat at the start (such as winning after a boneheaded opponent sinks the eight ball prematurely). Graphically, the pool table and action are presented well enough, while the backgrounds are a bit sparse. It would\'ve been nice if the computer opponent faces were animated a lot more when they talk, but otherwise, there\'s nothing to gripe about visually. There are a couple irritating aspects in the story mode. The computer is sometimes slow in making decisions, plus there\'s extra ""cue aiming"" animation as your opponent prepares to hit a ball. This slows the game down a touch. As for the practice mode, there\'s no ""optional"" ball tracking so players can learn how to aim better, as there is in Virtual Pool 64. The music is bland; it would\'ve been nice to have the ability to play music from any CD, like in Backstreet Billiards. There\'s also one minor interface gripe. Since X is the shot power/shooting button, its possible to accidentally flub a shot while using X to clear off an onscreen message. Again, this forces you to be cautious with your button pressing, which slows the game down some more. While it\'s a good game, Pool Hustler is a few steps short of what Backstreet Billiards has to offer. It lacks any carom-type play and several play modes found in its main PlayStation competitor. (However, there is a hidden bowlliards play mode accessible by password - see the codes section for details). It\'s those drawbacks, plus other minor gameplay flaws, that keep this game from being great; instead it\'s merely good.<i>--Nelson Taruc</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Not wanting to let that go to waste, Nintendo has taken advantage in dishing up Wii Fit, complete with a new peripheral called the Balance Board.The game aims, in a nutshell, to get you fit.There are more than 40 different types of fitness training falling under four categories: 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Muscle Conditioning', 'Yoga Poses' (which sound thoroughly treacherous to us) and 'Balance Games'. The games make use of both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck combo and the Balance Board. Yes, the Balance Board...A new peripheral, the Balance Board is set on the floor and stood upon. It's equipped with pressure sensors, so players will be able to engage in activities from trying to head footballs to downhill skiing. It comes bundled with Wii Fit in one tidy package.In addition to all the exercising treachery mentioned above, players will be able to gauge their body mass index and find out their fitness age.One thing's for sure, it's going to be a hit with the ladies (and chaps who want to beef up before stepping out). It's also a thorough kick in the Body Mass Index for all the naysayers who read The Daily Mail and only see games as 'murder simulators'.Information:Number of players: 1Development Company: NintendoSoftware House: NintendoVideo Dimensions: 2DPublisher: NintendoPoint Of View: Third person, into the screen""]","by

Moto Racer 2 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The ultimate motorcycle racing game is back--and totally customizable. Build your own tracks with the new 3-D track creator and share them with your friends. Feel the adrenaline rush of high-speed racing with improved graphics and more 3-D acceleration. Choose a tire-smoking superbike or a rugged motocross bike and hang on for the ride of your life.', 'Features: <br />* Track creator lets you create, modify, and save your own tracks. <br />* Race up to 4 players on a split screen or over the Internet or a local area network in single or team races. <br />* Tracks, 32 in all, stretch from the Amazon to the Sahara. <br />* Weather modes, night racing, and real-time lighting effects. <br />* Arcade or simulation modes. <br />* Choose the level of realism for bike handling.', ""Bigger and better than its predecessor, Moto Racer 2 from Electronic Arts and Delphine offers more tracks, more bikes, and a custom track-editing feature that seriously enhances the game's replay value. This is still not a true motorcycle simulation, but as arcade racers go, Moto Racer 2 is one of the best."", 'Like the original game, Moto Racer 2 allows you to race superbikes or motocross dirt bikes on a variety of tracks. There are eight different bikes in each category, each with its own ratings for brakes, grip, top speed, and acceleration. As in the previous version, the quality of your brakes is meaningless, because you rarely use the things. Top speed and acceleration are usually the most important items to consider, though a good grip rating becomes vital in bad weather conditions.', 'One of the game\'s strengths is the sheer number of tracks available to you right at the outset - a whopping 32. True, eight of these tracks are repetitive simple loops that are intended as templates for the track editor (more on that in a second), but the other 24 tracks still represent a refreshing change from the usual ""win on every track and we\'ll unlock one more"" formula. The tracks are split evenly between superbike and motocross courses, and the environments include city streets, a rain forest, the desert, and the countryside of Brittany.', ""If the basic tracks aren't quite enough to satisfy you, the game also allows you to create and edit your own tracks with a slick built-in editing tool. Beginning with a flat circle, you can add and move control points, which allow you to alter the shape of the track. You can then raise and lower control points to create hills and valleys. The editor warns you when you've created too sharp a curve or too steep a hill, so you're pretty much assured of building a decent track every time. Finally, you can select any one of the game's preset environments for your track, and the editor will apply it automatically. It would have been nice to have more freedom in the placing of certain scenic elements (such as tunnels and bridges), but overall the editor is impressive. Once you have a track built and saved, you can easily share it with other Moto Racer 2 fans - each custom track file only takes up about 1KB of disk space. The track editor helps to keep the game playable even after you've conquered all the default courses. Better yet, it brings back fond memories of EA's Racing Destruction Set (for those Commodore 64 veterans out there)."", ""Gameplay is pretty much like the original Moto Racer. The game is not a motorcycle simulation, but it does feel sufficiently different from most car-racing games. Also, Moto Racer 2 does a great job of conveying the sheer speed of each race: When you top 150mph in Moto Racer 2, you really feel like you're going that fast. The difficulty levels are well stepped so that you can win pretty easily on the lowest setting but will be hard-pressed to place in the top three on the highest."", ""After playing Motocross Madness, some gamers may be disappointed by the limited - and relatively tame - tricks available in Moto Racer 2's motocross mode. Some other gameplay elements are disappointing as well, such as the fact that your speed drops almost to zero when you brush another bike - even though that bike continues to fly along at its previous pace. Also, the hard-to-spot curbs along the side of most tracks have the same deadening effect on your bike and will virtually eliminate you from contention after a single bump on the highest difficulty setting. Rarely will you ever crash in this game, unless you hit an obstacle during a wheelie (and then you might as well give up, as the game waits for an excruciatingly long time before setting you back on your bike). In fact, if you hit a jump poorly during a motocross race and start flying off the track, an invisible barrier will snap you right back in bounds, and you won't even lose control of your bike."", ""Obviously, the game was intended for fast-paced arcade action, and on that level it performs admirably. So long as you're not looking for a pure motorcycle sim with realistic physics and tons of motocross tricks to land, you simply can't go wrong with Moto Racer 2. With two racing modes, thrilling gameplay, a ton of tracks, and a track editor, Moto Racer 2 offers a whole lot of action for any arcade racing fan. <i>--Michael E.

It's the stuff grade-A horror movies are made of. The haunting atmosphere tries the nerves of even the most seasoned gamer.

The Drum Rocker Core is designed to take a real beating with all the positioning flexibility that professional drummers demand. Drum Rocker Core's professional aluminum drum rack lets you position your snare and tom pads wherever you want and its all-metal foot pedal is rugged and reliable. You can add optional Drum Rocker cymbals to customize your setup with real-feel, swinging cymbals that are color-assignable. And when you're ready to move from playing Rock Band to playing in a rock band, you can swap the game controller module with one of the professional drum brains made by Alesis, and you're ready to hit the road for real! Drum Rocker Core's velocity-sensitive drum pads feature a playing surface that is much quieter than other drum controllers. They also feel great  the stick rebound off of the pad is much more natural and consistent than anything else available. The pad housing is made of high-impact plastic, designed to be whacked on stage night after night. No matter how much you punish them, the Drum Rocker Core drum pads can take it. The pads are mounted to the drum rack with a metal L-Arm and clamp system, which allows them to be tilted, swiveled, raised and lowered to whatever position you want. Just one warning  once you play these pads, nothing else will do! The kick drum pedal with any drum controller takes a lot of abuse.
