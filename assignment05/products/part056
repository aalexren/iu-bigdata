Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.']","by

This series started in 1994 with The King of Fighters 94 and would eventually see the exciting Orochi Saga in KOF 95-97, the NESTS Saga in KOF 99-2001 and the Ash Saga from KOR 2003 onward, introducing such iconic characters as Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, which have earned a large fan following the world over. \n\nThe King of Fighters XIII features fighters from the entire history of the series and concludes the Ash Saga storyline. \n\nNEO MAX Super Moves\n\nNew for KOFXIII are the NEO MAX super moves, the ultimate move for each character. The requirements are strict and it takes practice to get the move to connect, but it boards the most destructive power of all available attacks and has the possibility of completely turning around a match. It features the most impressive graphic and sound effects in the game to realise the maximum sense of exhilaration and excitement.']","by

Set in the dark times between Episodes III and IV, the story is both a continuation of the prequel trilogy -- exploring the aftermath of Order 66, which called for the immediate execution of all Jedi, and focusing on the continued rise of Darth Vader -- and a direct bridge to the Original Trilogy. The Force Unleashed will forever change the fate of the Galaxy and explain key plot points that directly lead into events in Star Wars: A New Hope. With The Force Unleashed , LucasArts not only introduces a new chapter in the Star Wars saga, but also two completely new and innovative technologies -- Digital Molecular Matter by Pixelux Entertainment and euphoria by NaturalMotion Ltd. These groundbreaking technologies combine with Havoc physics to create true next-gen game play and the Force like it's never been seen or experienced before. Confront and associate with familiar faces from the Star Wars films, including Darth Vader in addition to new adversaries such as fugitive Jedi and Force-sensitive Felucians Unleash and upgrade the Secret Apprentice's four core Force powers - Force push, grip, repulse and lightning - throughout the course of the game, and combine them for ultra-destructive, never-before-seen combos. Examples of unleashing the Force in ways never thought possible: Secret Apprentice won't just Force push enemies into walls - he'll Force push enemies through walls, and will Force grip them in midair, zap them with lightning, then drop them to the ground Visit locations such as Episode III's Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk and the floral Felucia, the junk planet Raxus Prime, plus an Imperial TIE fighter construction facility Decisions mad""]",Activision,"['>#66,339 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#1,628 in Video Games > Nintendo DS > Games']",,Video Games,B0014FUWZI

Lander 1.0 - PC,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"[""Games that pit a landing spacecraft against its natural enemy, gravity, have been released for virtually every manmade computing device except the abacus. However, it's been a pretty dry decade for lunar-lander simulations. Aside from a few shareware efforts and Palm Pilot programming exercises, no notable addition to the landing category has appeared since the late 1980s. Lander is Psygnosis' attempt to reinvigorate the genre by incorporating 3D-accelerated visuals and audio, multiplayer options, and even DVD support into the classic tale of descending spaceship vs. attracting celestial body. But thanks to Lander's perversely counterintuitive control scheme, Psygnosis may have killed this endangered breed of game for good."", ""Lander has a story. Well, enough about Lander's story. The game is structured as a series of jobs that can be completed for payment. At times, you may have several commissions available at once, making the navigation of the game's thirty or so levels not strictly linear. You can use the fees you collect by successfully completing tasks to purchase new weapons, upgrade your ship's engines and shielding, or even procure one of five different landing vehicles. Every mission involves piloting your craft to some planetary hotspot and either extracting or delivering an object before your fuel runs out. Often there are complications, such as having to battle aggressive tanks and gun turrets. A few missions include some surprises. For example, one routine recovery job has you unexpectedly defending a besieged tank commander who radios you for help. But generally, the most notable struggle is the one to keep some semblance of control over the squirrelly hindquarters of your spaceship."", ""Your landing craft is designed in the style of the famous Japanese movie monster Gamera. However, instead of a single jet sticking out of its rear, the ship's sole rocket thruster is affixed to its belly and pointed straight down. Like the giant flying turtle, your lander is in constant danger of flipping over and getting stuck on its back while its stomach-mounted engine pushes it farther into the ground. There's a keyboard command to right the craft, and you'll be using it often, since controlling the vehicle is so difficult. To move the ship, you must point it in the direction you'd like to travel then apply some thrust. The ship will shoot off in that direction, its trajectory influenced by the force of gravity. If you've applied too much throttle or simply want to go in another direction, you need to reorient the ship and fire the thrusters again. The problem is that getting the ship to point in the desired direction is much trickier than it should be. Using a combination of the mouse and keyboard, you can rotate the ship on three axes, but the rotation is inexact and especially difficult in the heat of battle."", ""Once more or less mastered, the control scheme works best only when the game gives you some room to maneuver, such as when you're flying over the surface of a planet with nothing but sky above you. At these times, Lander is almost enjoyable. Unfortunately, the goal of virtually every mission rests within a maze of cramped, Descent-like tunnels. Attempting to pilot the craft through these areas is unpleasant at best. Worse yet, the camera placement is not always up to the task of providing you with a clear view of your surroundings. Often, you must attack ceiling-mounted turrets that are not actually visible, and flying up through vertical tubes is an act of faith since the default view points down. You can adjust the camera manually, but it's just too cumbersome when you're simultaneously trying to micromanage control of your ship. This extreme, unwavering difficulty combined with a lack of an in-mission save option guarantees hours of frustration."", ""At least Lander's graphics are excellent. Fog, lighting, and weather effects are very well done, and if you stick with the game long enough, you'll witness some incredible vistas. The somber techno soundtrack is also good. Up to four players can participate over an IPX or TCP/IP connection in any of Lander's three multiplayer game modes - deathmatch, capture the flag, and tag. The multiplayer game is stable and relatively smooth over the Internet, but is really nothing more than a chance for you to experience the agony of controlling Lander's wacky spaceships with three of your friends."", ""The single-thruster craft, while perfect for games about landing on the moon, is wholly unsuited to the precision indoor combat maneuvers simulated in Lander. It's like taking a blimp to a jet battle. Lander is ultimately a grim depiction of a future in which mankind's elite starship pilots don't even have the common sense to choose the right tool for the job. <i>--Erik Wolpaw </i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Williams produces sketches of areas of interest, and it&apos;s up to gamers to explore the town and find each area. Instead of packing all of its items in a series of static scenes, Shadow Lake presents lists of objects that are strewn about the game&apos;s various locations, and players are given the freedom to track them down in any order they please. The story unfolds over ten chapters, with gamers collecting hundreds of hidden items, solving a variety of inventory puzzles, taking on mini-games, and eventually discovering the truth.']","by

Hexagon Production Manager and head of Production Peter Faluisi explained the philosophy behind the game: ""Players are so experienced today and know all the clichs and are a bit jaded, so it gets harder to surprise and entertain them.

The audio and music was done by Steve Sauve, who also worked Hexagon\'s previous game Jewels of the Oracle (1995). The development team used graphics packages like LightWave, Maya, 3DS Max, and Virtools Dev to make the game. According to Faluisi, ""This allows us to do high-polygon count (hi-res) images for the 360 navigation nodes and the animations and also makes it easier to put together chunks of object oriented code with Devs Building Blocks technology.""', '', '']",Dreamcatcher Interactive,[],$4.08,Software,B000EPPF7O

As a veteran group of warriors who have seen the most brutal of battles, the Bloodjaws are appointed to complete a mission that could change the course of the war: kill the one man responsible for all of the bloodshed, the one who has, for years, exhorted the human masses to loath and fight the green-skinned people... the Emperor himself.\n\nGoblin, Styx will soon join you to aid you in your mission. He is everything Arkal is not. While Arkal focuses on power, due to his incredible strength, Styx benefits from darker powers and stealth abilities, making him the perfect assassin. From the filthy alleys at the foot of the Great Wall to the depths of the Empire of Men, your heroes will face the greatest dangers throughout their epic quest.']","by
