Humans suffered terribly in the constant combat between the two, combat which shook the universe to its very core. In order to ease this suffering, the Enlightened banished the divine power of the Dark One, imprisoning it in a stone, known as an Artifact, but at a price. Inseparably linked, where one of the divine beings went the other was bound to follow and so the power of the Enlightened was captured in a matching Artifact.

Both were revered by all peoples and a balanced, but never-ending battle between the two persisted for centuries. Humans suffered terribly in the constant combat between the two, combat which shook the universe to its very core. In order to ease this suffering, the Enlightened banished the divine power of the Dark One, imprisoning it in a stone, known as an Artifact, but at a price. Inseparably linked, where one of the divine beings went the other was bound to follow and so the power of the Enlightened was captured in a matching Artifact. Together the two were hidden away and peace, as well as balance was restored to the universe. But peace is a fragile thing. It is said that any human who comes in contact with the Artifacts will be cursed and the power of darkness will once again be awakened. Enter the game\'s heroine Ayumi. As the game begins a map which has been lost for countless years suddenly turns up and it shows the location of the artifacts. Unaware of the curse, the adventurer Ayumi searches for and finds the immensely valuable stones, releasing powerful forces in her body. Her goal and the player\'s is to discover what the secret of the curse is, free herself from it and at last defeat the darkness.<p/> <p/> <b>Characters</b><br/> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""2""> <tr> <td valign=""middle"" align=""left"" width=""8%""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/ayumi.75.jpg"" width=""75"" height=""75"" alt=""Ayumi from \'X-Blades\'""></td> <td width=""92%""><b>Ayumi</b><br/>Ayumi is a charismatic heroine and fearless treasure hunter.

As you awake from a coma for the first time since that fateful day, you find the Stilwater you once ruled is in disarray. Unfamiliar gangs have laid claim to your territory, rival factions have taken over your rackets, and cash-hungry corporations have laid waste to your once proud 3rd Street home. Abandoned and left scarred with an unrecognizable face, you seek out a plastic surgeon to begin your new life on the streets. Yet some things never change in Stilwater. <p/>Respect can only be earned and that requires a lifestyle that reflects your unique personality. Your crib, your crew, and your character define who you are on the streets and how you are perceived. The image you portray is as important as the decisions you make in a city ruled by false bravado and impulsive behavior. The only constant is the need for an identity that reflects your individuality. But style and image can only take you so far in a world where actions speak louder than words. Sometimes sending a message to your enemies requires heavy lifting, like that of a rival gang member into oncoming traffic. Respect in Stilwater needs to be taken, and what better way than to grab it from the hands of a gang full of enemies by means of a satchel charge, a flame-thrower or those minigun rounds you\'ve been saving for a special occasion. <p/> <b>Meet Your Homies</b><br/> But remember that the fight to reclaim Stilwater does not have to be waged alone. The Saints once ruled these streets as a crew of brothers, and their return to the top can help be secured through co-operative alliances. The time has finally come to seek revenge against your rivals to reestablish your crew as the rightful kings of Stilwater, but the streets are crawling with bangers. Check out the crews you\'ll run into and remember their faces and their ways:<p/> <TABLE border=""0"" cellpadding=""5""> <TD width=""79""><img valign=""top"" alt=""The Third St. Saints - a gang of \'Saints Row 2\'"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sr2.saints.jpg"" width=""75"" height=""75"" align=""top"" hspace=""0"" vspace=""0""> </TD> <TD width=""850"" valign=""top""><b>3rd Street Saints</b><br/> Once the kings of the city, the Saints have been forced out of their titular home of Saints Row by the Ultor Corporation, a giant conglomerate that gentrified the once poor neighborhood.

As you awake from a coma for the first time since that fateful day, you find the Stilwater you once ruled is in disarray. Unfamiliar gangs have laid claim to your territory, rival factions have taken over your rackets, and cash-hungry corporations have laid waste to your once proud 3rd Street home. Abandoned and left scarred with an unrecognizable face, you seek out a plastic surgeon to begin your new life on the streets. Yet some things never change in Stilwater. <p/>Respect can only be earned and that requires a lifestyle that reflects your    unique personality. Your crib, your crew, and your character define who you    are on the streets and how you are perceived. The image you portray is as important    as the decisions you make in a city ruled by false bravado and impulsive behavior.    The only constant is the need for an identity that reflects your individuality.    But style and image can only take you so far in a world where actions speak    louder than words. Sometimes sending a message to your enemies requires heavy    lifting, like that of a rival gang member into oncoming traffic. Respect in    Stilwater needs to be taken, and what better way than to grab it from the hands    of a gang full of enemies by means of a satchel charge, a flame-thrower or those    minigun rounds you\'ve been saving for a special occasion. <p/> <b>Meet Your Homies</b><br/> But remember that the  fight to reclaim Stilwater does not have to be waged alone. The Saints once ruled these streets as a crew of brothers, and their return to the top can help be secured through co-operative alliances. The time has finally come to seek revenge against your rivals to reestablish your crew as the rightful kings of Stilwater, but the streets are crawling with bangers. Check out the crews you\'ll run into and remember their faces and their ways:<p/> <TABLE border=""0"" cellpadding=""5"">            <TD width=""79""><img valign=""top"" alt=""The Third St. Saints - a gang of \'Saints Row 2\'"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/sr2.saints.jpg"" width=""75"" height=""75"" align=""top"" hspace=""0"" vspace=""0"">      </TD>       <TD width=""850"" valign=""top""><b>3rd Street Saints</b><br/>         Once the kings of the city, the Saints have been forced out of their titular home of Saints Row by the Ultor Corporation, a giant conglomerate that gentrified the once poor neighborhood.

Although there are other weapons in the game, these primary weapons allow players to hurtle through the Void at blistering speeds, shooting down anything that gets in their way. Available at anytime in the game after aquired, they epitomize 3D action by introducing a unique vertical combat system full of possibilities and bringing a whole new sense of tension and thrill to the player. In addition, if they so choose players can use their aerial capabilities to counter attacks leveled at them while on the ground and to deal with spatial issues that they may face throughout the game. But just becasue the hooverpack and jetpack are available at all times, this does not mean that they are always the best option. Through trial and error as well as experience with the devices, player\'s must determine their best uses for each situation. <p/> As a companion to its duel combat style, <i>Dark Void</i> also contains a duel cover mechanic. As with other aspects of the game\'s ground combat, players can expect convenient standard cover options, including a single button option to snap to cover against walls, etc. Cover options while using the hooverpack and jetpack are understandably more varied though, with players being able to utilize vertical cover options to shoot both up and down. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Sci-Fi action/adventure combines aerial and on-foot combat for a totally unique third-person shooter experience.</li> <li>Will&rsquo;s jetpack delives total freedom of movement allowing players to race against UFOs in high-speed chases and rain death from above onto unsuspecting otherworldly foes.</li> <li>Speed and scale unmatched by any other action title: send Will zipping through tight corridors and then out into immense canyons and futuristic geoscapes.</li> <li>Gravity-defying vertical combat system, where moving up is the only way to bring your enemies down.</li> <li>Seemless transition between jetpack flight, ship-to-ship dog fighting and third-person shoot-&lsquo;em-up action all exists within the same level &ndash; not broken up into different areas.</li> <li>Unique grip system that allows the players to scale walls by jumping from surface to surface and hijack UFO&rsquo;s while in mid-air.</li> <li>Huge bosses that require fast reflexes and aerial barnstorming maneuvers to defeat.</li> <li>Developed by Airtight Studios, a new group featuring team members from the <i>Crimson Skies</i> series of video games.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player\'s ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be. <p/> <b>Gameplay: The Two Sides of Sonic</b><br> Like nearly all <i>Sonic</i> games, <i>Sonic Unleashed</i> is platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of the <i>Sonic</i> series love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic\'s split personality, things are a little bit different. <p/>Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with \'Ring Energy,\' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of \'Sonic Boost.\' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition, <i>Sonic Unleashed</i> introduces two new features: the \'Speed Drift\' and the \'Quick Step\'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible. <p/>As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.<p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed</b> - Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.</li> <li><b>Tight Navigation and Speed Control</b> - Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.</li> <li><b>Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics</b> - With its new modified game engine, <i>Sonic Unleashed</i> enhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.</li> <li><b>Enhanced and Expanded Environments</b> - Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.</li> </ul> Whether it\'s the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in the <i>Sonic</i> franchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play, <i>Sonic Unleashed</i> offers something for players of any age or level of ability. <p/>']","by

As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player\'s ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be. <p/> <b>Gameplay: The Two Sides of Sonic</b><br> Like nearly all <i>Sonic</i> games, <i>Sonic Unleashed</i> is platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of the <i>Sonic</i> series love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic\'s split personality, things are a little bit different. <p/>Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with \'Ring Energy,\' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of \'Sonic Boost.\' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition, <i>Sonic Unleashed</i> introduces two new features: the \'Speed Drift\' and the \'Quick Step\'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible. <p/>As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.<p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed</b> - Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.</li> <li><b>Tight Navigation and Speed Control</b> - Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.</li> <li><b>Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics</b> - With its new modified game Engine, <i>Sonic Unleashed</i> enhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.</li> <li><b>Enhanced and Expanded Environments</b> - Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.</li> </ul> Whether it\'s the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in the <i>Sonic</i> franchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play, <i>Sonic Unleashed</i> offers something for players of any age or level of ability. <p/>']","by

Here this unlikely hero is caught up in a desperate struggle for survival, joining forces with a rebel human group called The Survivors in their struggle against an ancient and hostile race known as the Watchers who have enslaved the humans of the Void for millenia.

Although there are other weapons in the game, these primary weapons allow players to hurtle through the Void at blistering speeds, shooting down anything that gets in their way. Available at anytime in the game after aquired, they epitomize 3D action by introducing a unique vertical combat system full of possibilities and bringing a whole new sense of tension and thrill to the player. In addition, if they so choose players can use their aerial capabilities to counter attacks leveled at them while on the ground and to deal with spatial issues that they may face throughout the game. But just becasue the hooverpack and jetpack are available at all times, this does not mean that they are always the best option. Through trial and error as well as experience with the devices, player\'s must determine their best uses for each situation. <p/> As a companion to its duel combat style, <i>Dark Void</i> also contains a duel cover mechanic. As with other aspects of the game\'s ground combat, players can expect convenient standard cover options, including a single button option to snap to cover against walls, etc. Cover options while using the hooverpack and jetpack are understandably more varied though, with players being able to utilize vertical cover options to shoot both up and down. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Sci-Fi action/adventure combines aerial and on-foot combat for a totally unique third-person shooter experience.</li> <li>Will&rsquo;s jetpack delives total freedom of movement allowing players to race against UFOs in high-speed chases and rain death from above onto unsuspecting otherworldly foes.</li> <li>Speed and scale unmatched by any other action title: send Will zipping through tight corridors and then out into immense canyons and futuristic geoscapes.</li> <li>Gravity-defying vertical combat system, where moving up is the only way to bring your enemies down.</li> <li>Seemless transition between jetpack flight, ship-to-ship dog fighting and third-person shoot-&lsquo;em-up action all exists within the same level &ndash; not broken up into different areas.</li> <li>Unique grip system that allows the players to scale walls by jumping from surface to surface and hijack UFO&rsquo;s while in mid-air.</li> <li>Huge bosses that require fast reflexes and aerial barnstorming maneuvers to defeat.</li> <li>Developed by Airtight Studios, a new group featuring team members from the <i>Crimson Skies</i> series of video games.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

In Raiden\'s case it was a victory over Shao Kahn, while Superman bested Darkseid. These occurred at the exact same time and involved inter-dimensional elements, which somehow merged their two enemies into one being, Dark Kahn, while allowing the characters of the two universes to interact. In this merging the powers of the heroes and villains are scrambled as well, making some stronger than they ever were, and leaving others vulnerable for the first time in their lives, allowing each to battle on more or less equal footing. And battle they do without realizing that the uncontrollable rage that they feel for each other is actually the work of Dark Khan. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</i> being a fighter, gameplay consists of one-on-one battles, both in local play and online, in which players can choose a character from either side who will face off against a counterpart from the other. Each character has unique attacks and special finishing moves, and fighting arenas vary depending on whether your character comes from the <i>Mortal Kombat</i> or DC universe. Keeping with the reputation for brutality in the <i>Mortal Kombat</i> franchise, characters from this side will have access to fatalities, while the historically less overly violent DC Comics characters will execute ""heroic brutalities,"" which are end moves where the opponent while beaten, is not killed. The game also features new gameplay mechanics such as: Freefall Kombat, in which players can engage in extended combat while in midair; Klose Kombat, during which the play angle moves to a close-up view of the action; The ""Test Your Might"" mini-game where you smash your opponent through walls; and Rage Mode, which increases the power of a character\'s attack by 50% and provides protection against being stunned by an opponent. <p/> <b>Playable Characters</b><br/> Playable characters in <i>Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</i> consist of some of the most popular heroes and villains from both universes, with most being available from the beginning of the game and some unlockable throughout.

Your word is law as you become the all powerful Overlord, a mysterious figure that has inherited the legacy of the evil after being raised from the dead. The games key innovation is the introduction of an array of impish creatures - the Minions. Accompanied by a horde of these slavishly loyal rascals, the Overlord plays dirty tricks on anything that moves to become even more powerful. The gremlin-like critters will follow your every instruction no matter how despotic or, for the Minions, life threatening it is. The PlayStation 3 version of this game allows you to explore and conquer 5 extra supernatural realms. Defend the Overlord's tower against waves of enemy attack with seven additional online multiplayer maps, including the competitive 'Capture the Maiden' map and 'Protect Your Power'. The Challenge Pack also introduces a 'Legendary' mode, which challenges you by using your most aggressive minion managing skills to complete the single-player game under exceptional circumstances. The PlayStation 3 edition includes 7.1 Surround Sound, screen hints, tactics and tips and an onscreen mini-map making it easier to navigate around the world of the Overlord.

return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table> <b>New Physics Engine</b><br/> Featuring a dramatically improved physics engine, <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> brings players closer to the sweet science than ever before. Through these upgrades fighters are rendered more vividly than ever and action is animated as it happens, meaning that not only are no two rounds the same, but no two punches are the same either. This variety in punches is most evident at the point of impact, where players will see everything from the sweat splatter of devastating shots, to the energy-sucking effects of solid body blows and the virtual lack of impact glancing blows may have on a determined opponent. But when enough of any punches land the damage system built into the new physics system will allow players to clearly see the impact on opponents exactly when and where you hit them. A bloody nose or lip, a cut or swelling over the eye, a bruised forehead or shoulder; players will see them all, and it\'s their choice whether to take advantage and go for the stoppage. <p/> In addition, the improved physics also makes for a significantly faster gameplay experience. Along with the game\'s controller and overall movement tweeks this allows player\'s to string together punches into devastating combinations. Although a single punch still has the potential to take down a rival, just as in real boxing match, combinations and the ability to avoid them are the key in <i>Fight Night Round 4</i>. <p/> <b>Height, Reach and Styles Matter</b><br> As in real boxing, where height and reach have advantages and disadvantages depending on your opponent and your skill, <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> forces players to use their fighters\' physical characteristics and styles to their advantage, or suffer the consequences. these consequences come by way of fighters ability to now fight effectively in close, as well as from a distance. For example, shorter fighters are often faster than taller opponents and tend to do better on the inside against taller fighters, but they must get inside first. If they choose to fight at a distance, the advantage is lost. Similarly, height and the assumed longer reach that goes with it is a sizable advantage, but only if a fighter ""fights tall,"" that is stand up straight and utilizes the jab and other punches to maintain the optimal distance to from opponent that allows him to hit and not be hit in return. Slouch and/or abandon the jab, and the reach advantage is lost. <p/> <b>New Heads Up Display Adds Blocking Ability</b><br> In addition to the traditional Heads Up Display (HUD), which has always provided <i>Fight Night</i> players with a visual representation of the changing health and stamina or their fighters, <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> adds blocking to its HUD. Designed to both provide an ongoing way to monitor your fighter\'s ability to defend himself when not punching and facilitate action during rounds by encouraging players to develop additional defensive and offensive skills, blocking is yet another realistic addition introduced by <i>Fight Night Round 4</i>. When players lose the ability to block punches they can not avoid punches thrown by opponents and must go on the offensive or take the punches. Blocking ability, as well as health and stamina can be replenished between rounds by assigning points accumulated for action in the ring to any of the three physical states/abilities. <p/> <b>Roster of Fighters</b><br> <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> features a large roster of fighters from multiple eras and weight classes. Made up of more than 40 fighters this elite group provides players with the ability to not only relive past and current rivalries, but to also create new ones across time to solve the question of who is really the greatest of all time. Just a few of the fighters that players can expect to take into the ring include: Mike Tyson, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Roy Jones Jr., Manny Pacquiao, Lennox Lewis, Sugar Ray Leonard, Winky Wright, Eddie Chambers, Ricky Hatton, James Toney. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Physics Based Gameplay Engine</b> - No fight will be the same with an all-new physics-based gameplay engine that recreates the full spectrum of true-to-life punch impacts, giving boxers a devastating arsenal of punches, blocks and ring movement. the new physics system allows for missed punches, glancing punches, knockout blows and for the first time ever, rough and tumble inside fighting.</li> <li><b>Realistic Boxer Styles</b> - <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> emulates the styles of history&rsquo;s greatest boxers like never before. Pressure your opponent with the brawling inside style of young Mike Tyson, bobbing and weaving to set up powerful hooks and uppercuts. Capitalize on Muhammad Ali&rsquo;s reach, hand speed and fleetness of foot to bewilder your opponent with lightning fast jabs and straights from the outside.</li> <li><b>Extensive Boxer Roster</b> - the greatest of all time, fighting in their prime. <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> lets you create fantasy matchups, such as Tyson versus Ali, and finally settle who is king of the ring. With a boxer roster spanning both history and modern times, the matchup possibilities are endless.</li> <li><b>Online Support Through Xbox LIVE</b> - <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> features full Xbox LIVE support including 2-player multiplayer options and LIVE achievements and gamer points.</li> </ul> <b>Legacy Mode</b><br/> Legacy Mode is <i>Fight Night Round 4</i>\'s career mode. Through it players develop their fighter from the ground up, starting in amateur competition which progresses into a career as a pro and may even include steps up or down into multiple weight classes to take on new challenges. Within this mode players can either accept the fights made for them, or create their own schedule of opponents. Either way, the goal is to rise in the ranks from contender, to champ, hall of famer, superstar and eventually the greatest ever. To do this players must not only win their bouts, but gain popularity and additional prestigious matches by winning them convincingly. <p/> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

return false;"">View larger</a>.</span> </center> </td> </tr> </table> <b>New Physics Engine</b><br/> Featuring a dramatically improved physics engine, <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> brings players closer to the sweet science than ever before. Through these upgrades fighters are rendered more vividly than ever and action is animated as it happens, meaning that not only are no two rounds the same, but no two punches are the same either. This variety in punches is most evident at the point of impact, where players will see everything from the sweat splatter of devastating shots, to the energy-sucking effects of solid body blows and the virtual lack of impact glancing blows may have on a determined opponent. But when enough of any punches land the damage system built into the new physics system will allow players to clearly see the impact on opponents exactly when and where you hit them. A bloody nose or lip, a cut or swelling over the eye, a bruised forehead or shoulder; players will see them all, and it\'s their choice whether to take advantage and go for the stoppage. <p/> In addition, the improved physics also makes for a significantly faster gameplay experience. Along with the game\'s controller and overall movement tweeks this allows player\'s to string together punches into devastating combinations. Although a single punch still has the potential to take down a rival, just as in real boxing match, combinations and the ability to avoid them are the key in <i>Fight Night Round 4</i>. <p/> <b>Height, Reach and Styles Matter</b><br> As in real boxing, where height and reach have advantages and disadvantages depending on your opponent and your skill, <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> forces players to use their fighters\' physical characteristics and styles to their advantage, or suffer the consequences. these consequences come by way of fighters ability to now fight effectively in close, as well as from a distance. For example, shorter fighters are often faster than taller opponents and tend to do better on the inside against taller fighters, but they must get inside first. If they choose to fight at a distance, the advantage is lost. Similarly, height and the assumed longer reach that goes with it is a sizable advantage, but only if a fighter ""fights tall,"" that is stand up straight and utilizes the jab and other punches to maintain the optimal distance to from opponent that allows him to hit and not be hit in return. Slouch and/or abandon the jab, and the reach advantage is lost. <p/> <b>New Heads Up Display Adds Blocking Ability</b><br> In addition to the traditional Heads Up Display (HUD), which has always provided <i>Fight Night</i> players with a visual representation of the changing health and stamina or their fighters, <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> adds blocking to its HUD. Designed to both provide an ongoing way to monitor your fighter\'s ability to defend himself when not punching and facilitate action during rounds by encouraging players to develop additional defensive and offensive skills, blocking is yet another realistic addition introduced by <i>Fight Night Round 4</i>. When players lose the ability to block punches they can not avoid punches thrown by opponents and must go on the offensive or take the punches. Blocking ability, as well as health and stamina can be replenished between rounds by assigning points accumulated for action in the ring to any of the three physical states/abilities. <p/> <b>Roster of Fighters</b><br> <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> features a large roster of fighters from multiple eras and weight classes. Made up of more than 40 fighters this elite group provides players with the ability to not only relive past and current rivalries, but to also create new ones across time to solve the question of who is really the greatest of all time. Just a few of the fighters that players can expect to take into the ring include: Mike Tyson, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Roy Jones Jr., Manny Pacquiao, Lennox Lewis, Sugar Ray Leonard, Winky Wright, Eddie Chambers, Ricky Hatton, James Toney. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Physics Based Gameplay Engine</b> - No fight will be the same with an all-new physics-based gameplay engine that recreates the full spectrum of true-to-life punch impacts, giving boxers a devastating arsenal of punches, blocks and ring movement. the new physics system allows for missed punches, glancing punches, knockout blows and for the first time ever, rough and tumble inside fighting.</li> <li><b>Realistic Boxer Styles</b> - <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> emulates the styles of history&rsquo;s greatest boxers like never before. Pressure your opponent with the brawling inside style of young Mike Tyson, bobbing and weaving to set up powerful hooks and uppercuts. Capitalize on Muhammad Ali&rsquo;s reach, hand speed and fleetness of foot to bewilder your opponent with lightning fast jabs and straights from the outside.</li> <li><b>Extensive Boxer Roster</b> - the greatest of all time, fighting in their prime. <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> lets you create fantasy matchups, such as Tyson versus Ali, and finally settle who is king of the ring. With a boxer roster spanning both history and modern times, the matchup possibilities are endless.</li> <li><b>Online Support Through PlayStation Network</b> - <i>Fight Night Round 4</i> features full PSN support including 2-player multiplayer options and PlayStation trophies.</li> </ul> <b>Legacy Mode</b><br/> Legacy Mode is <i>Fight Night Round 4</i>\'s career mode. Through it players develop their fighter from the ground up, starting in amateur competition which progresses into a career as a pro and may even include steps up or down into multiple weight classes to take on new challenges. Within this mode players can either accept the fights made for them, or create their own schedule of opponents. Either way, the goal is to rise in the ranks from contender, to champ, hall of famer, superstar and eventually the greatest ever. To do this players must not only win their bouts, but gain popularity and additional prestigious matches by winning them convincingly. <p/> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

In Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, three new campaigns comprised of 15 new scenarios tell stories of Asian struggle during some of the most pivotal moments in history. In 15th century China, an immense treasure fleet aims to expand the influence of the Ming Dynasty to distant shores. When a power hungry admiral sends the ships adrift into seas unknown, the voyage takes an unexpected turn...to the west. In 16th century Japan, a loyal general leads the armies of his adopted father, Tokugawa Ieyasu, in a bid to seize power. But as the greater war rages, a surprising revelation ignites an unexpected internal struggle that must be won before the epic Battle of Sekigahara. In 19th century India, a soft-spoken lieutenant in the pay of the British East India Company can endure the foreign occupiers no longer, and takes up arms against his superiors. <BR><BR>', ""<b>The Dawn of a New Age.</b> <p/> Command one of eight mighty powers grappling to conquer the New World in this new generation of the landmark Age of Empires series. <p/> Experience the Age of Discovery through amazing 3D graphics.

The new Home City feature is unlike anything you've experienced before in a real-time strategy game. Age of Empires III gives players extensive control over their side of the battlefield. <p/> There are many ways to play Age of Empires III. Play against the computer on random maps.

As you get better, your Home City becomes stronger, allowing you to unlock new types of soldiers or buildings, broaden your tech tree, and customize the appearance of your city. You can even visit your Home City to watch its citizens, get an opinion on how you?re doing, or plot your next move. <p/> You?re in control of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry, artillery, Native American warriors, mercenaries, and ships. You can assign different formations to your army, like Volley, Charge, or Bombard, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation for you. <p/> The real-time physics cause infantry struck by cannon balls to get thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff into the water. Cannon balls bounce and ricochet. Shingles, shutters, and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain. And, with hundreds of unique combat animations, you?ll never see the same battle twice. <p/> Tone mapping gives scenes a photorealistic look by balancing colors in a scene. Units and buildings cast realistic shadows based on the sun?s position. Water glistens like water, foams near the shore, and reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight, and the motion of the water. Steep cliffs jut from the terrain like paintings from the American Southwest. <br/><br/>""]","by

Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort&rsquo;s defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. <p/> Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different, but equally unavoidable adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn\'t counted on Romilda Vane&rsquo;s chocolates. And then there&rsquo;s Hermione, simmering with jealously, but determined not to show her feelings. Yet as romance blossoms throughout Hogwarts, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.<p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Like earlier video game releases in the <i>Harry Potter</i> franchise, the action in <i>Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince</i> the Video Game revolves around the exploration of Hogwarts and the action that results from what you uncover. The game features both engrossing single player and local multiplayer modes, as well as additional unique play features. During their adventures, players will have a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels, mix and brew magical ingredients in potions class and take to the air to lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team to victory. Players may even get sidetracked by Ron&rsquo;s romantic entanglements as they journey towards a dramatic climax and discover the identity of the Half-Blood Prince. <p/> <b>Key Features</b><br/> <ul> <li>Relive the action of the movie&hellip;from the Hogwarts Express, to the dramatic revelation of the Half-Blood Prince.</li> <li>Feel the thrill of Quidditch as the Wii Remote and Nunchuck become your broomstick and you speed through the stadium.</li> <li>Compete for Gryffindor for the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup: Take on Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin in the most exciting wizarding sport.</li> <li>Defeat the Dark Forces as you use the Wii Remote as your wand to duel your way through the story of <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i>.</li> <li>Perfect your potion-mixing skills using the Wii Remote to stir, shake and pour potions from the Half-Blood Prince&rsquo;s recipes.</li> <li>Explore Hogwarts at night, taking on nighttime missions while the castle sleeps.</li> <li>When you get stuck, call on Nearly Headless Nick for clues and tips to help you complete your challenges.</li> <li>See more of the wizarding world as you explore new magical places scattered throughout the game.</li> <li>Travel with Dumbledore to piece together Voldermort\'s past, and sneak around Hogwarts to discover Malfoy\'s secrets.</li> <li>2-player local multiplayer support.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Choose the melee-based Warrior or Scout for up-close action, or pick the Archer or Mage to perform devastating ranged attacks. There is also talk of a 'special' class called the Guardian to give gamers a third choice. But don't worry about getting locked in, as you can actually change which character class you're playing on the fly, in the middle of the game's various objective-based missions."", ""Each class of characters has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique special abilities. Playable units range from grunt soldiers, which are the weakest, to captains, which are the strongest AI units in the game other than the heroes. You also get to order in air strikes using either eagles or fellbeasts. Even better, players will be able to mount the occasional horse, unless they've chosen evil, in which case they will have to master the skill of riding a fearsome warg.<P> <b>Multiple Modes for Endless Fun</b><br> As in Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest has enormous competitive multiplayer modes, including Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Hero Deathmatch. In addition to these classics, Conquest adds a Ring Bearer mode, in which one player tries to stay alive as Frodo against a host of ringwraiths, and Stronghold in which you fight on various maps in a Risk-style battle for territories. Fortunately, you won't be limited to roaming around with only your teammates, however, as battles occur in large scale with non-player combatants joining in the fray."", 'Conquest allows online play with up to 16 players for massive battles with all your friends, or in two-player cooperative mode. Players can also play locally with up to four players competitively, or two-player co-op on a split screen.

Participate in the Battle of Isengard as an Ent or fight Saruman at Orthanc as Gandalf himself. Take on the Nazgul as Aragorn while still protecting Frodo, or battle at Pelennor as a Rohirrim cavalry soldier. And that is just for the good guys!', ""In Conquest you will have to play many different characters in order to win. And it isn't always such a balanced match, as you will find yourself destroying towering siege engines and taking on hulking oliphaunts with your companions. You can choose to play all the heroes you love, or fight as a Nazgul tasked with killing Frodo and stretch your powerful wings as the Balrog himself in your battle for Moria."", ""<b>Pick Your Own Style of Play</b><br> In the game, you'll be able to play as one of four different character classes. Choose the melee-based Warrior or Scout for up-close action, or pick the Archer or Mage to perform devastating ranged attacks. There is also talk of a 'special' class called the Guardian to give gamers a third choice. But don't worry about getting locked in, as you can actually change which character class you're playing on the fly, in the middle of the game's various objective-based missions."", ""Each class of characters has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique special abilities. Playable units range from grunt soldiers, which are the weakest, to captains, which are the strongest AI units in the game besides the heroes. You also get to order in air strikes using either eagles or fellbeasts. Even better, players will be able to mount the occasional horse, unless they've chosen evil, in which case they will have to master the skill of riding a fearsome warg.<P> <b>Multiple Modes for Endless Fun</b><br> As in Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest has enormous competitive multiplayer modes, including Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Hero Deathmatch. In addition to these classics, Conquest adds a Ring Bearer mode, in which one player tries to stay alive as Frodo against a host of ringwraiths, and Stronghold in which you fight on various maps in a Risk-style battle for territories. Fortunately, you won't be limited to roaming around with only your teammates, however, as battles occur in large scale with non-player combatants joining in the fray."", 'Conquest allows online play with up to 16 players for massive battles with all your friends, or in two-player cooperative mode. Players can also play locally with up to four players competitively, or two-player co-op on a split screen. When in the game itself, fans will get the thrill of hearing Howard Shore\'s score for the films accompanying the action, and both good and evil campaigns are narrated by Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond in the movies. <br clear=""all""> <center> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page//B001AZFSDI-5-lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=860,height=500\'); return false;""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page//B001AZFSDI-5-sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top></a> <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page//B001AZFSDI-6-lg.jpg"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,null,\'width=860,height=500\'); return false;""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page//B001AZFSDI-6-sm.jpg"" border=0></a><br><br> <span class=""caption"">You can choose to play either good or evil, each with different endings. </class> </center> <br clear=""all"">']","by

Initially, she started her working life in a beauty salon before the outbreak of war inspired her to move to London and join the weapon industry. It didn\'t take too long for her to be noticed by the Secret Services; she was after all beautiful, athletic and had great attention to detail. It was only a formality that she was recruited into MI6 during Britain\'s darkest hours. <p/> Violette had lost an aunt during one of the first Luftwaffe bombing attacks and to further compound her heartache she later lost her RAF husband in battle. However, she was strong willed and used these painful experiences to inspire her to succeed as a spy for the MI6. And successful she was, but all things come to an end; or do they. Violette carried out several missions successfully before being captured by the Germans. Now lost in a coma and dying in hospital bed, she replays key moments from her past missions as a series of flashbacks. But where does reality end and hallucination begin? <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Gameplay in <i>Velvet Assassin</i> is made up of a series of missions behind enemy lines in Nazi occupied Europe that Violette flashes back on from her hospital bed. The twist here is that although these have already happened, their outcome is not set. Missions are a mix of assassinations, demolitions and rescue operations where the player, is entirely on their own. Because of this, and your limited ability to carry weapons and ammo, you must rely heavily on stealth and weapons that draw the least amount of attention. If detected Violette will have to fight her way out of situations where she will always be outnumbered and almost certainly outgunned, yet when discovered and the chances of survival are slim, players do have the option of activating a play feature called \'Morphine Mode.\' A sort of \'bullet time\' linked to the drugs that Violette receives during her physical reality in her hospital bed, Morphine Mode allows the player to briefly freeze time, providing an opportunity to dispose of enemies without taking damage or to attempt escape. The experience leaves Violette dazed for a few moments though, so regardless of what the mode is used for players should make good one their plans to avoid being taken out as their heads clear. <p/> <b>Adjustable Skills</b><br/> Violette\'s skills as an assassin are customizable. By completing missions successfully players accumulate the ability to change Violette\'s attributes to suit a preferred playing style and/or as a means of preparing Violette for anticipated combat situations. These customizable combat areas include stealth, strength, weapon handling and Morphine Mode effectiveness.<p/> <b>Realistic WWII Era Weapons</b><br/> Although <i>Velvet Assassin</i> is primarily a stealth game, and as such players can expect to become extremely proficient with dispatching enemies silently with a blade, it also features a wealth of authentic looking and functioning Allied and Nazi weapons from the WWII era. Just a few of those included are: MP40 submachine gun, grenades, Colt .45 pistol, Lugar 9mm pistol, flame-throwers, shotguns, STG-44 assault rifle and the MG-42 machine gun. <p/> <b>12 Authentic European Locations</b><br/> Go on assassination missions in hyper-realistic dreamlike settings that are modeled after actual WWII locations.

Initially, she started her working life in a beauty salon before the outbreak of war inspired her to move to London and join the weapon industry. It didn\'t take too long for her to be noticed by the Secret Services; she was after all beautiful, athletic and had great attention to detail. It was only a formality that she was recruited into MI6 during Britain\'s darkest hours. <p/> Violette had lost an aunt during one of the first Luftwaffe bombing attacks and to further compound her heartache she later lost her RAF husband in battle. However, she was strong willed and used these painful experiences to inspire her to succeed as a spy for the MI6. And successful she was, but all things come to an end; or do they. Violette carried out several missions successfully before being captured by the Germans. Now lost in a coma and dying in hospital bed, she replays key moments from her past missions as a series of flashbacks. But where does reality end and hallucination begin? <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Gameplay in <i>Velvet Assassin</i> is made up of a series of missions behind enemy lines in Nazi occupied Europe that Violette flashes back on from her hospital bed. The twist here is that although these have already happened, their outcome is not set. Missions are a mix of assassinations, demolitions and rescue operations where the player, is entirely on their own. Because of this, and your limited ability to carry weapons and ammo, you must rely heavily on stealth and weapons that draw the least amount of attention. If detected Violette will have to fight her way out of situations where she will always be outnumbered and almost certainly outgunned, yet when discovered and the chances of survival are slim, players do have the option of activating a play feature called \'Morphine Mode.\' A sort of \'bullet time\' linked to the drugs that Violette receives during her physical reality in her hospital bed, Morphine Mode allows the player to briefly freeze time, providing an opportunity to dispose of enemies without taking damage or to attempt escape. The experience leaves Violette dazed for a few moments though, so regardless of what the mode is used for players should make good one their plans to avoid being taken out as their heads clear. <p/> <b>Adjustable Skills</b><br/> Violette\'s skills as an assassin are customizable. By completing missions successfully players accumulate the ability to change Violette\'s attributes to suit a preferred playing style and/or as a means of preparing Violette for anticipated combat situations. These customizable combat areas include stealth, strength, weapon handling and Morphine Mode effectiveness.<p/> <b>Realistic WWII Era Weapons</b><br/> Although <i>Velvet Assassin</i> is primarily a stealth game, and as such players can expect to become extremely proficient with dispatching enemies silently with a blade, it also features a wealth of authentic looking and functioning Allied and Nazi weapons from the WWII era. Just a few of those included are: MP40 submachine gun, grenades, Colt .45 pistol, Lugar 9mm pistol, flame-throwers, shotguns, STG-44 assault rifle and the MG-42 machine gun. <p/> <b>12 Authentic European Locations</b><br/> Go on assassination missions in hyper-realistic dreamlike settings that are modeled after actual WWII locations. While on assignment you will battle Nazi enemies from the shadows, will discover letters and treasures left behind by German soldiers, be forced to deal with the frightening nature of your own nightmares, and complete rescue missions that are anything but life saving. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Brutal assassinations</b> - Use historically accurate World War II guns and knives to viciously execute your enemies.</li> <li><b>Dynamic lighting and shadows</b> - Slip into the darkness of Nazi-controlled Europe and avoid the relentless searchlights of German guards that cut through your shadowy cover.</li> <li><b>Stylized environments</b> - Explore surreal, dreamlike settings that are modeled after actual World War II locations.</li> <li><b>Adjustable skill</b> - Adjustable skills allow you to change Violette\'s attributes to suit your playing style.</li> <li><b>Xbox Achievements and Gamer Points</b> - Velvet Assassin feature 45 unlockable achievements and 1,000 gamer points.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table>']","by

Here players will encounter familiar faces representing both sides of the Force, as well as many new ones, as they take on missions on behalf of the Jedi Council, or in spite of it, during the troubling times of the Clone Wars. The highlight of these missions will be the memorable lightsaber duels and the Jedi and Sith players will battle against in them. These duels are designed to mirror as closely as possible the encounters faced in the animated adventures, to the point that they are even introduced by cinematic segments pulled right from the series and feature film. In addition, utilizing writing talent from both of these related projects, as well as a majority of the voice talent as well in a truly collaborative manner, players can expect to see things in the game that eventually make it to the TV show and vice versa.<p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> One of the most anticipated uses of the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controller configuration in the history of the Wii gaming system, gameplay in <i>Lightsaber Duels</i> is all about introducing players into the civilized but deadly world of hand to hand Jedi combat techniques. That means no blasters here. As the game\'s subtitle suggests, whether playing as a servant of the will of the Jedi Council or the Dark Side of the Force, players will wield a lightsaber in one hand and the power of the force in the other. This is where the Wii Remote and Nunchuck come in. <p/> Far from requiring players to build up their skills and knowledge of the Force, the goal of the control scheme of <i>Lightsaber Duels</i> is actually designed to make even beginning gamers a force to be reckoned from the first duel they face. The Wii Remote controls your lightsaber through a series of tiered attacks. Left and right motions of the remote equate to light damage, up and down slashes represent medium damage and stabbing motions do maximum damage. The remote\'s trigger provides a blocking mechanism, while the Nunchuck controls your Force powers. In addition, each character possesses unique combo abilities, but keeping with the simplicity of the control scheme all players need to do is memorize these simple combos to take advantage of their power. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li>Fight the most memorable duels from <i>The Clone Wars</i> feature film and TV series.</li> <li>Wield your Wii Remote like a lightsaber and experience first-hand the unique weapon of the Jedi Knights with intuitive controls, so no matter what your gaming experience you can become a lightsaber master.</li> <li>Play as your favorite <i>Clone Wars</i> hero or villain - from familiar characters like Anakin Skywalker and General Grievous to new faces like Ahsoka Tano and Asajj Ventress - each with a unique fighting style and set of skills.</li> <li>Exploit your interactive surroundings to defeat your opponent: slice down pillars and Force throw them against your foe.</li> <li>2-player multiplayer support in Battle Modes</li> <li>60 frame per second performance ensure smooth gameplay.</li> <li>Duel your way through significant <i>Clone Wars</i> locations, such as Tatooine and Teth.</li> </ul> <b>Playable Characters</b><br/> In <i>Star Wars The Clone Wars: Lightsaber Duels</i> players can take on the role of one of ten characters. These include, Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, Mace Windu, Count Dooku, Asajj Ventress, General Grievous, Kit Fisto, Yoda and Plo Koon. Each of these possess their own abilities and can unlock items as the game progresses. In addition, with over 4,000 lines of dialog recoded for the game, characters are programmed to respond to other characters based on their relationship, not randomly, making for the truest Jedi experience yet.<p/>']","by
