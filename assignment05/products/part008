This was a tough mission to accomplish, but it did so by focusing compelling squad-based tactical gameplay against the backstory of a fictional squad within the US Army\'s 101st Airborne Division as they battle through a historically correct re-creation of the events of the Allied invasion of Europe during WWII. This type of realism is more or less unheard of in the video game world and can only be provided by someone who really knows their stuff. Enter Colonel John Antal, US Army (Ret.).', ""Vice President of Knowledge Operations and Military and Historical Director at Gearbox Software, developers of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series, Colonel Antal is an Airborne-Ranger officer, and a published author of scores of magazine articles, as well as several fiction and nonfiction books on military topics. Most importantly for the subject at hand though, he is also a major force behind the development of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series. Recently I was able to catch up with him and ask some questions regarding the newest title in that line, <em>Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway</em>."", '', '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I just returned from a ten day visit with US and NATO troops in Afghanistan, and I can report to you that when Soldiers are not fighting, they are training for the next fight.  The more time Soldiers spend training in realistic simulated battles, the less blood spilled in battle. During my thirty years in the US Army, I trained thousands of Soldiers using constructive, virtual and live military simulations. Once I retired, it was an easy leap for me to switch my experience with military simulations into value-added content for video games.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I know you've probably been asked this question a thousand times, but let's make it a thousand and one. Operation Market Garden, the WWII allied offensive that <em>Hell's Highway</em> is based on culminated in a German victory. Why make a video game based on a defeat?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Market Garden was not a complete success, but war is fought at many levels. At the squad level, war is about fighting for the next hill, hamlet or road junction. Victory and defeat is very clear in a squad - when the battle is over you either have won and lived, or have lost and most of your comrades are dead or wounded. In <em>Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway</em>, we created a historical fiction that is true to the real history of the battle in ways no other game has approached. The true story of the battle for Hells Highway is dramatic and a worthy story.  If we told only stories of victories, we wouldn't be telling true historical fiction. War is about victory AND defeat, gain and loss. Telling both is part of being true to the actual history."", '<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: As a follow-up to this, because this game is based on a very real and in many senses, tragic event for the forces involved and the civilian population, was there more pressure to stick to the facts in this game in order to get things right? And if so how did your team ensure this?', ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Yes. We have done our best to make the game the most authentic WWII experience ever. Our goal is to put you in the boots of a true-to-life squad leader in the 101st Airborne during the fight for Hell's Highway. This game addresses the true history of the Battle for Hell's Highway, uses realistic tactics and requires you to lead a rifle squad in ways that no other game has ever done."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: The game's story is centered around the events of an American squad, but since Operation Market Garden was an allied offensive, will players get to control, or even better, play as other allied forces? And will there be any playable German characters?"", '<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/""><img align=""right"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/biahh.novel.jpg"" /></a><strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will play as an American, Staff Sergeant Matt Baker. If you want to learn more about the British, the Dutch Resistance and the Germans, read my companion novel to the game, ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/"">Brothers in Arms, Hell\'s Highway</a>"", published by Ballantine Books, Random House. There will also be a history book out in January 2009 that explains the battle for Hell\'s Highway in day-to-day detail with maps, historical photos, screenshots from the game and much more. Shop for the Colonel\'s companion novel, ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/"">Brothers in Arms, Hell\'s Highway</a>.""', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I've read that <em>Hell's Highway</em> will contain a whole new multiplayer experience. Can you shed some light on how this experience is different from what previous games in the series offered?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Multiplayer is really exciting. Our multiplayer design is different from other games because it brings squad game play on-line. We created a team based game, where the team-based aspect is about squad organization. The game will select (or players will vote on) a commander on each team. There can be up to 20 people in the game, 10 per team. The teams will go after objectives in each map that will be resolved in rounds.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: A common criticism in squad-based games is that    AI enemies engaged in singleplayer modes are too easily outwitted, which is    obviously something that should not happen on a real battlefield. Was dealing    with this a consideration in the development of <em>Hell's Highway</em>?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Yes, the team did a good job at creating a robust enemy AI that is clearly a tough opponent. Players will be excited about this feature.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> will feature a wide variety of weapons, not only used by US forces, but also those of allied troops and the Germans. Are all of these usable by any character and if so does each have specific ammo?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: All the small arms -- pistols and rifles -- will be useable, as well as most of the crew served weapons (like machine guns). Players can choose from semi-automatic rifles such as the M1-Carbine and M1-Garand, to machine guns such as the M1A1, bazookas such as the M9A1 and pistols. To check out all the weapons you can use and see them in action, check out the website (www.brothersinarmsgame.com in 'the game' section)."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> is the first <em>Brother in Arms</em> title to come to Next-Gen platforms. How much has the visual clarity made possible on these platforms helped in the series' ongoing quest for authenticity?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The visual clarity is stunning in this game. It makes use of the Unreal 3 Engine technology to deliver incredibly realistic, authentic and cutting-edge 3D environments. The game also has unprecedented character design - with lifelike characters who look, talk, move and think with incredible realism.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> is the third game in the series featuring Sgt. Matt Baker, and now Sgt. Joe Hartsock. These two have differing views on the acceptable costs of war and have traded off command duties in the last two games. In <em>Hell's Highway</em> both lead separate squads, but Sgt. Baker appears to be front and center. Will the game feature the ability to play as either sergeant? And regardless, is this dichotomy of outlook regarding command as much an attempt at realism in the field as anything else in the game?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will play the role of Baker. The story of Baker and Hartsock, and their different approaches to leadership is a vital part of the story that I many of our fans will find intriguing.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I don't recall tanks playing too much of a role in earlier <em>Brothers in Arms</em> games, but one of the nicer videos I've seen indicated that they might be prominent in <em>Hell's Highway</em>. This seems a nice touch considering that Operation Market Garden's objective was to secure a path for armored units crossing into Germany. What exactly will players be able to do with tanks and what other new units and/or changes to the control scheme can players expect to see?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will be able to fight as part of a Sherman Firefly crew and will be able to battle German Panzers head to head.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: When last I saw <em>Hell's Highway</em> demoed, one of the things that stood out in my mind was the destructibility of environments and cover. Considering that the game in filled with weapons of varying destructive power, I thought this was a fantastic and natural addition. Can you give a few details on this for our readers?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Destructible cover allows the player greater tactical    flexibility. Now you can create a flank by blowing away flimsy cover that would    normally block your maneuver. The destructible cover system was modeled using    real physical properties and behaviors, so weapons will actually damage, dent,    scorch and destroy the world around you. It's a great addition to the game that    gives players a truly authentic experience."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Having grown up myself watching movies like <em>A Bridge Too Far</em>, <em>The Guns of Navarone</em>/<em>Force 10 From Navarone</em>, <em>Where Eagles Dare</em>, <em>The Dirty Dozen</em>, <em>Kelly's Heroes</em>, <em>The Longest Day</em>, etc. I've often wondered why the events of WWII have not been more heavily mined for game subject matter. With the continued success of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> franchise and others, as well as the power of Next-Gen technology, do you see this changing?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I strongly believe that powerful, dramatic human stories provide an exciting medium for video games. WWII was a vast WORLD WAR with countless powerful, dramatic, human stories. Anyone who is bored with WWII hasn't studied the war in depth. The stories from WWII have importance relevance to us today and are archetypical examples of the moral dilemma of war. No sane person wants war, but if you value life and liberty, sometimes you are forced to fight. I expect that we will be telling these stories and incorporating them into our games for many years to come."", '<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Since the framework of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series is the allied invasion of German-occupied Europe and the battles that would eventually make up the march towards Berlin/the race to beat the Red Army there, can players expect to see more from Sgt. Baker and his squad in the future, perhaps at the Battle of the Bulge and beyond?', '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: As long as I have anything to do with it, the answer is YES.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Finally, because it's interesting to pick the brains    of people behind the games, do you mind telling our readers what games you are    playing and/or what you are reading these days? Also, I know that you have authored    several fiction and nonfiction books as well as articles. Are you working on    anything new that you might want to tell us about?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I'm an Airborne-Ranger and have been a combat officer all my adult life. I pretty much like to play anything with WAR in the title!"", '', '--<em>Tom Milnes, Freelance Contributor</em>']","by

This was a tough mission to accomplish, but it did so by focusing compelling squad-based tactical gameplay against the backstory of a fictional squad within the US Army\'s 101st Airborne Division as they battle through a historically correct re-creation of the events of the Allied invasion of Europe during WWII. This type of realism is more or less unheard of in the video game world and can only be provided by someone who really knows their stuff. Enter Colonel John Antal, US Army (Ret.).', ""Vice President of Knowledge Operations and Military and Historical Director at Gearbox Software, developers of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series, Colonel Antal is an Airborne-Ranger officer, and a published author of scores of magazine articles, as well as several fiction and nonfiction books on military topics. Most importantly for the subject at hand though, he is also a major force behind the development of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series. Recently I was able to catch up with him and ask some questions regarding the newest title in that line, <em>Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway</em>."", '', '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I just returned from a ten day visit with US and NATO troops in Afghanistan, and I can report to you that when Soldiers are not fighting, they are training for the next fight. The more time Soldiers spend training in realistic simulated battles, the less blood spilled in battle. During my thirty years in the US Army, I trained thousands of Soldiers using constructive, virtual and live military simulations. Once I retired, it was an easy leap for me to switch my experience with military simulations into value-added content for video games.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I know you've probably been asked this question a thousand times, but let's make it a thousand and one. Operation Market Garden, the WWII allied offensive that <em>Hell's Highway</em> is based on culminated in a German victory. Why make a video game based on a defeat?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Market Garden was not a complete success, but war is fought at many levels. At the squad level, war is about fighting for the next hill, hamlet or road junction. Victory and defeat is very clear in a squad - when the battle is over you either have won and lived, or have lost and most of your comrades are dead or wounded. In <em>Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway</em>, we created a historical fiction that is true to the real history of the battle in ways no other game has approached. The true story of the battle for Hells Highway is dramatic and a worthy story. If we told only stories of victories, we wouldn't be telling true historical fiction. War is about victory AND defeat, gain and loss. Telling both is part of being true to the actual history."", '<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: As a follow-up to this, because this game is based on a very real and in many senses, tragic event for the forces involved and the civilian population, was there more pressure to stick to the facts in this game in order to get things right? And if so how did your team ensure this?', ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Yes. We have done our best to make the game the most authentic WWII experience ever. Our goal is to put you in the boots of a true-to-life squad leader in the 101st Airborne during the fight for Hell's Highway. This game addresses the true history of the Battle for Hell's Highway, uses realistic tactics and requires you to lead a rifle squad in ways that no other game has ever done."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: The game's story is centered around the events of an American squad, but since Operation Market Garden was an allied offensive, will players get to control, or even better, play as other allied forces? And will there be any playable German characters?"", '<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/""><img align=""right"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/biahh.novel.jpg"" /></a><strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will play as an American, Staff Sergeant Matt Baker. If you want to learn more about the British, the Dutch Resistance and the Germans, read my companion novel to the game, ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/"">Brothers in Arms, Hell\'s Highway</a>"", published by Ballantine Books, Random House. There will also be a history book out in January 2009 that explains the battle for Hell\'s Highway in day-to-day detail with maps, historical photos, screenshots from the game and much more. Shop for the Colonel\'s companion novel, ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/"">Brothers in Arms, Hell\'s Highway</a>.""', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I've read that <em>Hell's Highway</em> will contain a whole new multiplayer experience. Can you shed some light on how this experience is different from what previous games in the series offered?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Multiplayer is really exciting. Our multiplayer design is different from other games because it brings squad game play on-line. We created a team based game, where the team-based aspect is about squad organization. The game will select (or players will vote on) a commander on each team. There can be up to 20 people in the game, 10 per team. The teams will go after objectives in each map that will be resolved in rounds.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: A common criticism in squad-based games is that AI enemies engaged in singleplayer modes are too easily outwitted, which is obviously something that should not happen on a real battlefield. Was dealing with this a consideration in the development of <em>Hell's Highway</em>?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Yes, the team did a good job at creating a robust enemy AI that is clearly a tough opponent. Players will be excited about this feature.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> will feature a wide variety of weapons, not only used by US forces, but also those of allied troops and the Germans. Are all of these usable by any character and if so does each have specific ammo?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: All the small arms -- pistols and rifles -- will be useable, as well as most of the crew served weapons (like machine guns). Players can choose from semi-automatic rifles such as the M1-Carbine and M1-Garand, to machine guns such as the M1A1, bazookas such as the M9A1 and pistols. To check out all the weapons you can use and see them in action, check out the website (www.brothersinarmsgame.com in 'the game' section)."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> is the first <em>Brother in Arms</em> title to come to Next-Gen platforms. How much has the visual clarity made possible on these platforms helped in the series' ongoing quest for authenticity?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The visual clarity is stunning in this game. It makes use of the Unreal 3 Engine technology to deliver incredibly realistic, authentic and cutting-edge 3D environments. The game also has unprecedented character design - with lifelike characters who look, talk, move and think with incredible realism.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> is the third game in the series featuring Sgt. Matt Baker, and now Sgt. Joe Hartsock. These two have differing views on the acceptable costs of war and have traded off command duties in the last two games. In <em>Hell's Highway</em> both lead separate squads, but Sgt. Baker appears to be front and center. Will the game feature the ability to play as either sergeant? And regardless, is this dichotomy of outlook regarding command as much an attempt at realism in the field as anything else in the game?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will play the role of Baker. The story of Baker and Hartsock, and their different approaches to leadership is a vital part of the story that I many of our fans will find intriguing.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I don't recall tanks playing too much of a role in earlier <em>Brothers in Arms</em> games, but one of the nicer videos I've seen indicated that they might be prominent in <em>Hell's Highway</em>. This seems a nice touch considering that Operation Market Garden's objective was to secure a path for armored units crossing into Germany. What exactly will players be able to do with tanks and what other new units and/or changes to the control scheme can players expect to see?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will be able to fight as part of a Sherman Firefly crew and will be able to battle German Panzers head to head.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: When last I saw <em>Hell's Highway</em> demoed, one of the things that stood out in my mind was the destructibility of environments and cover. Considering that the game in filled with weapons of varying destructive power, I thought this was a fantastic and natural addition. Can you give a few details on this for our readers?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Destructible cover allows the player greater tactical flexibility. Now you can create a flank by blowing away flimsy cover that would normally block your maneuver. The destructible cover system was modeled using real physical properties and behaviors, so weapons will actually damage, dent, scorch and destroy the world around you. It's a great addition to the game that gives players a truly authentic experience."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Having grown up myself watching movies like <em>A Bridge Too Far</em>, <em>The Guns of Navarone</em>/<em>Force 10 From Navarone</em>, <em>Where Eagles Dare</em>, <em>The Dirty Dozen</em>, <em>Kelly's Heroes</em>, <em>The Longest Day</em>, etc. I've often wondered why the events of WWII have not been more heavily mined for game subject matter. With the continued success of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> franchise and others, as well as the power of Next-Gen technology, do you see this changing?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I strongly believe that powerful, dramatic human stories provide an exciting medium for video games. WWII was a vast WORLD WAR with countless powerful, dramatic, human stories. Anyone who is bored with WWII hasn't studied the war in depth. The stories from WWII have importance relevance to us today and are archetypical examples of the moral dilemma of war. No sane person wants war, but if you value life and liberty, sometimes you are forced to fight. I expect that we will be telling these stories and incorporating them into our games for many years to come."", '<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Since the framework of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series is the allied invasion of German-occupied Europe and the battles that would eventually make up the march towards Berlin/the race to beat the Red Army there, can players expect to see more from Sgt. Baker and his squad in the future, perhaps at the Battle of the Bulge and beyond?', '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: As long as I have anything to do with it, the answer is YES.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Finally, because it's interesting to pick the brains of people behind the games, do you mind telling our readers what games you are playing and/or what you are reading these days? Also, I know that you have authored several fiction and nonfiction books as well as articles. Are you working on anything new that you might want to tell us about?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I'm an Airborne-Ranger and have been a combat officer all my adult life. I pretty much like to play anything with WAR in the title!"", '', '--<em>Tom Milnes, Freelance Contributor</em>']","by

These abilities are not static and as they progress they cause severe, accelerated pain; pain that eventually drives their hosts insane, turning them quite literally into monsters of superhuman power. Hayden possesses an unexpected resistance to this maddening pain, but his body is not spared the mutations caused by the virus. The first of these are metal armor that grows from his body and a three bladed, throwable weapon called a ""glaive"" which explodes from his right arm and can regenerate if lost. But these are only the beginning. Eventually players may also gain the power of limited invisibility, the use of a bulletproof shield and an assortment of deadly melee attacks.<p/>As Hayden slashes his way through the mutants overrunning Lasria he stumbles upon a plot by a rogue operative and his private army of henchmen to harness the power of the strongest of these mutants for some dark purpose.

It is of course deadly as a slashing weapon and can be thrown great distances, but as Hayden&#146;s powers evolve the glaive can be used in unexpected ways, ranging from siphoning and focusing elemental features like fire and freezing cold on enemies, to opening doors and retrieving items from inaccessible areas.

Some of these upgrades include increasing a weapon&#146;s firing rate, larger ammo clips, the ability to fire two simultaneous rounds and a &#145;puncture ability&#146; that allows you to shoot through any enemy to hit another standing behind him. Finding the entrances to the black market are important because firearms in the game are biologically sensitive to mutant powers and unless altered to ignore the existence of altered DNA are useless to the mutated Hayden.<p/><b>Gameplay Modes and Features</b><br/>Not only does <i>Dark Sector</i> contains a deep singleplayer story mode, but in addition it features multiplayer functionality allowing players to harness Hayden Tenno&#146;s mutant powers in two different ways, both in awesome 10-person online multiplayer combat.

The player in the role of Hayden receives a single point for each kill made, while the soldier that takes him down gets 2, plus the right to wield the glaive in the next go around.

These abilities are not static and as they progress they cause severe, accelerated pain; pain that eventually drives their hosts insane, turning them quite literally into monsters of superhuman power. Hayden possesses an unexpected resistance to this maddening pain, but his body is not spared the mutations caused by the virus. The first of these are metal armor that grows from his body and a three bladed, throwable weapon called a ""glaive"" which explodes from his right arm and can regenerate if lost. But these are only the beginning. Eventually players may also gain the power of limited invisibility, the use of a bulletproof shield and an assortment of deadly melee attacks.<p/>As Hayden slashes his way through the mutants overrunning Lasria he stumbles upon a plot by a rogue operative and his private army of henchmen to harness the power of the strongest of these mutants for some dark purpose. No longer entirely human, but not a mindless mutant Hayden must make a decision whether to use his own new powers to stop this plot or look the other way.

VS are equipped with a power output device that allows them to utilize Thermal Energy collected from the Akrid without any processing. They are equipped with a variety of weaponry and high mobility in order to battle the Akrid, but they can be especially deadly to humans as well.', 'Different VS allow the player to perform different maneuvers. The basic GT-01 was originally created to assist with aid efforts at the start of colonization. As a result, it is limited in its expandability and armor. Conversely, the GTF-11 was the first VS to be equipped with an advanced posture control system originally designed for space fighters. This allows the GTF-11 to be outfitted with flight propulsion, and as a result it has been heavily used in the current colonization effort.', '<b>An Alien Horde</b><br> Indigenous creatures to the planet, Akrid have adapted to the extremely low temperatures.

Chryatis, for example, is extremely aggressive and has heightened senses. Upon sensing thermal energy that it traces from any living being other than another Akrid, it immediately attacks the source as a threat that must be eradicated. Once in attack mode, the Chryatis won't stop until all traces of thermal energy are gone. While Chryatis is busy eliminating prey on the ground, the smaller Trilid Akrid take to the skies. Weak on their on but strong in swarms, Trilid attack in groups to overcome and confuse their opponents."", 'However, not all Akrid are what they appear to be. Dongo, a crawling Akrid, has an extremely hard outer shell that forms a nearly indestructible armor.

The plan was ambitious - it was largest airborne invasion in the history of the world. The plan was to capture a corridor through Holland to punch through the German lines. Paratroopers of the 101st Airborne and other divisions dropped from the sky in mid-September to seize and hold the corridor by surprise. The surprise attack was a bust. Hitler\'s best units were in the area and immediately counter-attacked and crushed the corridor.', ""<strong>Meet the Squad</strong><br /> Although players see the chaos of Operation Market Garden exclusively through the eyes of Sgt.

This was a tough mission to accomplish, but it did so by focusing compelling squad-based tactical gameplay against the backstory of a fictional squad within the US Army\'s 101st Airborne Division as they battle through a historically correct re-creation of the events of the Allied invasion of Europe during WWII. This type of realism is more or less unheard of in the video game world and can only be provided by someone who really knows their stuff. Enter Colonel John Antal, US Army (Ret.).', ""Vice President of Knowledge Operations and Military and Historical Director at Gearbox Software, developers of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series, Colonel Antal is an Airborne-Ranger officer, and a published author of scores of magazine articles, as well as several fiction and nonfiction books on military topics. Most importantly for the subject at hand though, he is also a major force behind the development of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series. Recently I was able to catch up with him and ask some questions regarding the newest title in that line, <em>Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway</em>."", '', '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I just returned from a ten day visit with US and NATO troops in Afghanistan, and I can report to you that when Soldiers are not fighting, they are training for the next fight.  The more time Soldiers spend training in realistic simulated battles, the less blood spilled in battle. During my thirty years in the US Army, I trained thousands of Soldiers using constructive, virtual and live military simulations. Once I retired, it was an easy leap for me to switch my experience with military simulations into value-added content for video games.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I know you've probably been asked this question a thousand times, but let's make it a thousand and one. Operation Market Garden, the WWII allied offensive that <em>Hell's Highway</em> is based on culminated in a German victory. Why make a video game based on a defeat?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Market Garden was not a complete success, but war is fought at many levels. At the squad level, war is about fighting for the next hill, hamlet or road junction. Victory and defeat is very clear in a squad - when the battle is over you either have won and lived, or have lost and most of your comrades are dead or wounded. In <em>Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway</em>, we created a historical fiction that is true to the real history of the battle in ways no other game has approached. The true story of the battle for Hells Highway is dramatic and a worthy story.  If we told only stories of victories, we wouldn't be telling true historical fiction. War is about victory AND defeat, gain and loss. Telling both is part of being true to the actual history."", '<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: As a follow-up to this, because this game is based on a very real and in many senses, tragic event for the forces involved and the civilian population, was there more pressure to stick to the facts in this game in order to get things right? And if so how did your team ensure this?', ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Yes. We have done our best to make the game the most authentic WWII experience ever. Our goal is to put you in the boots of a true-to-life squad leader in the 101st Airborne during the fight for Hell's Highway. This game addresses the true history of the Battle for Hell's Highway, uses realistic tactics and requires you to lead a rifle squad in ways that no other game has ever done."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: The game's story is centered around the events of an American squad, but since Operation Market Garden was an allied offensive, will players get to control, or even better, play as other allied forces? And will there be any playable German characters?"", '<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/""><img align=""right"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/biahh.novel.jpg"" /></a><strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will play as an American, Staff Sergeant Matt Baker. If you want to learn more about the British, the Dutch Resistance and the Germans, read my companion novel to the game, ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/"">Brothers in Arms, Hell\'s Highway</a>"", published by Ballantine Books, Random House. There will also be a history book out in January 2009 that explains the battle for Hell\'s Highway in day-to-day detail with maps, historical photos, screenshots from the game and much more. Shop for the Colonel\'s companion novel, ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Arms-Hells-Highway-Novel/dp/0345503376/"">Brothers in Arms, Hell\'s Highway</a>.""', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I've read that <em>Hell's Highway</em> will contain a whole new multiplayer experience. Can you shed some light on how this experience is different from what previous games in the series offered?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Multiplayer is really exciting. Our multiplayer design is different from other games because it brings squad game play on-line. We created a team based game, where the team-based aspect is about squad organization. The game will select (or players will vote on) a commander on each team. There can be up to 20 people in the game, 10 per team. The teams will go after objectives in each map that will be resolved in rounds.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: A common criticism in squad-based games is that    AI enemies engaged in singleplayer modes are too easily outwitted, which is    obviously something that should not happen on a real battlefield. Was dealing    with this a consideration in the development of <em>Hell's Highway</em>?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Yes, the team did a good job at creating a robust enemy AI that is clearly a tough opponent. Players will be excited about this feature.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> will feature a wide variety of weapons, not only used by US forces, but also those of allied troops and the Germans. Are all of these usable by any character and if so does each have specific ammo?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: All the small arms -- pistols and rifles -- will be useable, as well as most of the crew served weapons (like machine guns). Players can choose from semi-automatic rifles such as the M1-Carbine and M1-Garand, to machine guns such as the M1A1, bazookas such as the M9A1 and pistols. To check out all the weapons you can use and see them in action, check out the website (www.brothersinarmsgame.com in 'the game' section)."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> is the first <em>Brother in Arms</em> title to come to Next-Gen platforms. How much has the visual clarity made possible on these platforms helped in the series' ongoing quest for authenticity?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The visual clarity is stunning in this game. It makes use of the Unreal 3 Engine technology to deliver incredibly realistic, authentic and cutting-edge 3D environments. The game also has unprecedented character design - with lifelike characters who look, talk, move and think with incredible realism.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: <em>Hell's Highway</em> is the third game in the series featuring Sgt. Matt Baker, and now Sgt. Joe Hartsock. These two have differing views on the acceptable costs of war and have traded off command duties in the last two games. In <em>Hell's Highway</em> both lead separate squads, but Sgt. Baker appears to be front and center. Will the game feature the ability to play as either sergeant? And regardless, is this dichotomy of outlook regarding command as much an attempt at realism in the field as anything else in the game?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will play the role of Baker. The story of Baker and Hartsock, and their different approaches to leadership is a vital part of the story that I many of our fans will find intriguing.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: I don't recall tanks playing too much of a role in earlier <em>Brothers in Arms</em> games, but one of the nicer videos I've seen indicated that they might be prominent in <em>Hell's Highway</em>. This seems a nice touch considering that Operation Market Garden's objective was to secure a path for armored units crossing into Germany. What exactly will players be able to do with tanks and what other new units and/or changes to the control scheme can players expect to see?"", '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: The player will be able to fight as part of a Sherman Firefly crew and will be able to battle German Panzers head to head.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: When last I saw <em>Hell's Highway</em> demoed, one of the things that stood out in my mind was the destructibility of environments and cover. Considering that the game in filled with weapons of varying destructive power, I thought this was a fantastic and natural addition. Can you give a few details on this for our readers?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: Destructible cover allows the player greater tactical    flexibility. Now you can create a flank by blowing away flimsy cover that would    normally block your maneuver. The destructible cover system was modeled using    real physical properties and behaviors, so weapons will actually damage, dent,    scorch and destroy the world around you. It's a great addition to the game that    gives players a truly authentic experience."", ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Having grown up myself watching movies like <em>A Bridge Too Far</em>, <em>The Guns of Navarone</em>/<em>Force 10 From Navarone</em>, <em>Where Eagles Dare</em>, <em>The Dirty Dozen</em>, <em>Kelly's Heroes</em>, <em>The Longest Day</em>, etc. I've often wondered why the events of WWII have not been more heavily mined for game subject matter. With the continued success of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> franchise and others, as well as the power of Next-Gen technology, do you see this changing?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I strongly believe that powerful, dramatic human stories provide an exciting medium for video games. WWII was a vast WORLD WAR with countless powerful, dramatic, human stories. Anyone who is bored with WWII hasn't studied the war in depth. The stories from WWII have importance relevance to us today and are archetypical examples of the moral dilemma of war. No sane person wants war, but if you value life and liberty, sometimes you are forced to fight. I expect that we will be telling these stories and incorporating them into our games for many years to come."", '<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Since the framework of the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> series is the allied invasion of German-occupied Europe and the battles that would eventually make up the march towards Berlin/the race to beat the Red Army there, can players expect to see more from Sgt. Baker and his squad in the future, perhaps at the Battle of the Bulge and beyond?', '<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: As long as I have anything to do with it, the answer is YES.', ""<strong>Amazon.com/games</strong>: Finally, because it's interesting to pick the brains    of people behind the games, do you mind telling our readers what games you are    playing and/or what you are reading these days? Also, I know that you have authored    several fiction and nonfiction books as well as articles. Are you working on    anything new that you might want to tell us about?"", ""<strong>Colonel Antal</strong>: I'm an Airborne-Ranger and have been a combat officer all my adult life. I pretty much like to play anything with WAR in the title!"", '', '--<em>Tom Milnes, Freelance Contributor</em>']","by

Over a decade later, Krone's program had successfully developed the world's first time-traveling suit technology. However, as the program's equally secretive decision-makers demanded this technology be adapted for military applications, Krone's feelings of self-entitlement and anger grew. He secretly desired a new existence, a new world where his scientific endeavors could be shaped and experienced without outside interference. The combination of Krone's mind and his suit technology gave him the ability to create and control another existence - an existence where a man of science could finally operate without restrictions and do so within a place where science itself was properly respected regardless of the effects on humanity. It is now up to you to trace Krone's last known appearances and stop his tyrannical rule over Alpha District.

Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company\'s ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane\'s troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn\'t quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.<p/><b>The Trouble with Dinosaurs</b><br/>The trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:<p/><u>Velociraptors</u> &#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.<p/><u>Mini-Raptors</u> &#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.<p/><u>Dilophosaurus </u>&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.<p/><u>Lurkers</u> &#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.<p/><u>Soldier Bugs</u> &#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.<p/><u>T-Rex</u> &#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.<p/>In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.<p/><b>Strategy and Multiplayer Mayhem</b><br/>Although the real attention grabber in <i>Turok</i> are the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.<p/>Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.<p/><b>Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet Kills</b><br/>True to its RPG roots <i>Turok</i> comes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.<p/>In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots, <i>Turok</i> is a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.']","by

The Japanese iteration was a realistic portrayal of a revolver style hand gun, but when released in North America was made to look like an unrealistic science fiction ray gun that also tied into the design of the NES. The gun has no real grip; the handle is hard plastic. Early Zappers were gray, but later the color was changed to a neon orange due to the fact that federal laws were passed in the US prohibiting toy guns from resembling real guns. It allowed players to aim at the TV. Different games used different targets; for example, the player may shoot ducks, clay pigeons, and many other targets. The Zapper has a trigger action that takes quite a bit of force to pull back, and frequent trigger-pulling has caused many people to get tired muscles in their hands or forearms. (Modern light guns have much less resistance on their triggers, in comparison.) Also, the trigger makes a loud characteristic &apos;p-kang&apos; noise when pulled.']","by

Sony Playstation Controller - Gray (Non-Dualshock),,['Original Sony Playstation Controller'],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'PlayStation', 'Accessories', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['The PlayStation Controller was the first gamepad released by Sony Computer Entertainment for its PlayStation video game console. The original version (model SCPH-1010) was released alongside the PlayStation on December 3, 1994.  Based on the basic button configuration established with Nintendo\'s Super NES Controller, the PlayStation Controller added a second pair of shoulder buttons for the middle fingers. Intended to update the gamepad for navigating 3D environments such as the ones PlayStation was designed to generate, the concept behind featuring shoulder buttons for both the index and middle fingers was to implement two-way directional depth controls using the two sets of buttons. To compensate for the less stable grip from shifting the middle fingers\' placement to the shoulders, grip handles were added to the controller.  Using the simple geometric shapes of a green triangle, a red circle, a blue cross, and a pink square (Triangle, Circle, Cross, Square) to label its action buttons rather than traditionally used letters or numbers, the PlayStation Controller established a trademark which would be incorporated heavily into the PlayStation brand. In an interview with Teiyu Goto, designer of the original PlayStation Controller, he explained what the symbols mean: The circle and cross represent \\""yes\\"" and \\""no,\\"" respectively; the triangle symbolizes a point of view and the square is equated to a sheet of paper there to be used to access menus.']","by

Those who were unlucky enough to survive now gather in the only sanctuary left, the Underground, banding together in order to gain a foothold against the minions of darkness and ultimately save the bloodline of humanity. <p/> It is no surprise that these sole survivors come from three of society&#146;s most elite factions, each of whom are masters of a robust number of skills and weapons essential to demon-thrashing. <p/> The Templar, a secret society preserving the rites of the original Knights Templar, mix futuristic technology with ancient artifacts to create powerful weapons and armor perfect for short-ranged and melee attacks. <p/> The Cabalists are students of the dark arts and edges of science which often leaves them standing right on the line between good and evil. Their mystifying spells make them suited for mid-range combat. <p/> The Hunters are mysterious, highly trained ex-military operatives who lay waste to their foes with hyper-advanced weapons that blend theoretical science and the latest in technology &#150; and their bullets can come from almost any distance. <p/> HellGate: London delivers an amazing gaming experience to PC gamers of all types &#150; delivering the eye-popping DX10 visuals demanded by the hardcore, and scaling to ensure the masses of casual RPG players can still get the best performance on older PCs. <p/> <b>Key Features</b> <ul> <li>The RPG Authority &#150; Flagship Studios was founded by the core creators of Diablo, one of the biggest PC gaming franchises in history with over 13 million units sold worldwide &#150; they are the first, last and only voice in the world of action RPGs. <li>Beyond RPG &#150; Experience new layers to the traditional hack-and-slash forumla by experiencing the action RPG from the first-person perspective and through nontraditional character classes and playstyles. <li>Have it your way - Three unique factions with their own visual and gameplay style, offering something for every type of gamer, whether they prefer the longer-range blasts of the Hunter or want to get up close and personal with the Templar. <li>Infinite Replayability &#150; Dynamically generated levels, chance events and massive quantities of randomly created items makes for infinite replayability -- no two experiences will ever be the same and every game will be it&#146;s own unique event. <li>Mad Skills &#150; Each faction has three character classes that contain a wide variety of skills and spells that are fully customizable. <li>London Calling &#150; Explore post-apocalyptic London, even darker and gloomier than usual.

Brutally trained from birth to be a cold-hearted assassin whose services are available to the highest bidder, yet troubled by a past he can&#146;t entirely remember, Geralt is a classic anti-hero. To this most renowned of witchers, a society of mutants born with superhuman strength and reflexes and trained at a high level in magic and alchemy, killing has been and seemingly should remain a strictly commercial affair, but as questions about his past come to the fore, so do doubts surrounding the morality of his trade. And these doubts only grow when bits of his past are revealed as he and you grow in power and acclaim through the progression of the game.<p/> <b>The Thin Line Between Good and Evil</b><br/> Far from a common black and white treatment of good and evil, the moral attitudes defining the world of <i>The Witcher</i> are as close to that of our own prevalent real world view as you are likely to see in a modern RPG. Set in a time dominated by vanity, greed and prejudice, there is no lack of work for Geralt as the kingdoms of the North forsake old alliances and give in to endless intrigue and purges instead of facing a growing tide of evil. But as despicable as the monsters, non-human enemies and pure human trash you are hired to eliminate may seem and may very well be, pity, mercy and good faith are nearly always a possible option to deadly force and one that can change Geralt&#146;s overall destiny. It&#146;s this kernel of reality in a universe peopled with fantastic and sometimes frightening beings and creatures against a backdrop of morally challenging scenarios that will keep players coming back for more as they explore the varying consequences of Geralt&#146;s choices and the choices forced upon him.<p/> <b>Character Development</b><br/> A witcher\'s destiny is preordained at birth, but your goal is to determine Geralt\'s specific path. Hidden within <i>The Witcher</i> are a startling 250 in-game skills and abilities that allow you to define and in many cases plan the evolution of Geralt&#146;s character. Will he rely mainly on his skill with a blade? Develop into an arcane battle mage? Transform into a potent alchemist? Or meld all these skills into a more complicated, but potentially unbeatable combo of all three? Give some thought to your path, but know it will not always be an easy or thoughtful one. Filled with non-linear decision-making opportunities and consequences, expect to be forced into quick decisions, choices between the lesser of two evils and to invariably be stuck with the consequences of your employer&#146;s short-sighted plans for your services. It&#146;s these consequences that will determine your progression through the game&#146;s storyline and lead to the availability of different skills and abilities.<p/> <b>Stunning Real-time Combat</b><br/> Possessing superior strength, speed and agility makes Geralt quick to draw his blade when conflict arises, but this birthright is not always the right skill to rely on and depending on the enemy, can prove disastrous. To survive in this world of varied threats you will need to put aside the button mashing common to other RPGs and utilize <i>The Witcher</i>&#146;s complex yet intuitive combat- based fighting system. You will learn quickly to switch seamlessly between the game&#146;s six combat styles, dozens of potions, complex alchemy and magic systems and weapons modification mode, using your mouse alone or mouse with keyboard, to add tactical depth to your combat experience. Once you have mastered these, you will also have time to appreciate the ground-breaking fluidity of the game&#146;s 600 in-game combat animations, based on actual medieval sword-fighting techniques and performed by experts at Frankfurt&#146;s renowned Metric Minds Studio.<p/> It&#146;s only through a combined focus on Geralt&#146;s physical and mental capabilities that you can hope to survive the viciously violent world he inhabits and unlock both his true potential as a warrior as well as the secrets hidden in his past.<p/> <b>Complete Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Geralt of Rivia: a one-of-a-kind protagonist</b> <ul> <li>A charismatic and unique character, Geralt is a mutant swordmaster and professional monster slayer. <li>Choose from over 250 special abilities correlated to attributes, combat skills and magical powers to build the character in a way best suited to tactical needs and style of play. </ul> </ul> <ul> <li><b>Original fantasy world drawn from literature</b> <ul> <li>Inspired by the writings of renowned Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. <li>Featuring adult themes, less fairy-tale than typical fantasy, with mature social issues like racism, political intrigue and genocide. <li>It is a harsh world where nothing is black or white, right or wrong, often forcing players to choose between the lesser of two evils to advance. </ul> </ul> <ul> <li><b>Non-linear and captivating storyline</b> <ul> <li>Full of turns, twists and ambiguous moral decisions which have real impact on the storyline. <li>All quests can be accomplished in several ways and the game has three different endings depending on the player&#146;s actions and choices throughout the adventure. </ul> </ul> <ul> <li><b>Visually stunning tactical action</b> <ul> <li>Engage in complex yet intuitive real-time combat based on real medieval sword-fighting techniques. <li>Motion capture performed by medieval fighting experts at Frankfurt&#146;s renowned Metric Minds studio, resulting in 600 spectacular and authentic in-game combat animations. <li>Six combat styles, dozens of potions, complex alchemy system, modifiable weapons and powerful magic add tactical depth to the fluid real-time experience. </ul> </ul> </ul> </ul>']","by

Story</b><br/>The <i>God of War</i> franchise tells the tragic and violent story of the warrior Kratos and his dealings with the gods. The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. In <i>Chains of Olympus</i> Kratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt. Olympus.<p/><b><i>God of War\'s</i> Epic Gameplay Comes to the PSP</b><br/>PlayStation Portable has always been head and shoulders above its competitors in the handheld market when it comes to processing power, and in <i>God of War: Chains of Olympus</i> the PSP platform may just have reached its highest level to date. Packed with features like dramatic camera angles, epic set pieces, cinematic cut scenes, stirring audio and seamless fast action gameplay, formerly only available on console platforms <i>Chains of Olympus</i> binds players to the game?s epic adventure, regardless where they are when they join in the action.<p/><b>Combat Moves, Both Old and New</b><br/>Nearly as defining as the name of Kratos itself, the trademark sweeping attack moves of the ?Ghost of Sparta? using his weapon of choice the ?Blades of Chaos,? epitomizes all <i>God of War</i> games and <i>Chains of Olympus</i> is no exception.<p/>Although overall the PSP has fewer buttons than the PlayStation 2 controller, developer Ready at Dawn Studios has managed to incorporate nearly all of the attack moves and combination moves from previous games in the series into this new project. This continuity in gameplay not only provides a seamless intro into the game for veteran players, but a gentle learning curve for players new to the series. Add to this new brutal combat moves and an additional upgradable weapon and you have a combat system that will engage players at all levels.<p/><b>Exploration and Puzzle Solving</b><br/>From the bright gates of Attica to the darkest dungeons of Tartarus, Kratos? journey and your own will take you through the dark and brutal world of Greek mythology. Here not only will your skill with the Blades of Chaos be tested, but your wits as well.<p/>As you explore the dangers of the ancient world, players must be prepared to use their navigational skills as they press on through labyrinths of challenging puzzles. Some may be simple tests at manipulating the game?s environment to your advantage, while others much more difficult also requiring precision timing of moves, but each will be different and test you in new ways.<p/><b>An Evolution in Franchise History</b><br/>More than just a missing piece in the history of the <i>God of War</i> franchise, <i>Chains of Olympus</i> also serves as an evolutionary link between the origins of the <i>God of War</i> franchise and its future. Originally developed for PlayStation 2, the future of the franchise is slated to make its arrival on PlayStation 3 in the form of the highly anticipated <i>God of War III</i> in the not too distant future. Not only is PlayStation Portable designed to work in unison with PlayStation 3 in many ways, but both long-time fans and newcomers to the series who choose to watch and play <i>Chains of Olympus</i> carefully may very well pick up clues as to the direction the franchise will be heading in with <i>God of War III</i>.<p/>Regardless, whether you find yourself playing for the current chapter in Kratos? saga or preparing yourself for the battles to come on the PlayStation 3, <i>God of War: Chains of Olympus</i> is a must have title for any current owner of a PSP or those considering getting in the handheld game with one.<p/>']","by

Howard's <i>Conan the Cimmerian</i> stories, <i>Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures</i> is a fantasy themed massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that immerses players in a dark, expansive universe filled with ground-breaking brutal combat, dangerously intoxicating magical abilities, and the social and cooperative game features that MMORPG players crave."", '', '<b>Massively Multiplayer Gaming for the Adult Player</b><br /> One of the most highly anticipated MMORPGs in recent years due to the strength and familiarity of the <i>Conan</i> franchise across a variety of major media, <i>Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures</i> is the first of several releases planned for the franchise, all of which are aimed at an adult audience. Firmly rooted in the savage, bloody, violent and sexy Hyborian universe, players can expect a graphically beautiful game blended with gritty gameplay that is true to both the barbarian hero from Howard?s writings and the Schwarzenegger influenced version from books, movies and comics.', '<b>Available Cultures and Classes</b><br />Although <i>Age of Conan </i> contains a wide range of peoples, its playable cultures are currently limited to Aquilonians, Cimmerians, and Stygians. Within each of these players can choose from a selection of archetypal character classes, although available classes and subsequent subclasses are not necessarily the same within each culture. For example, archetypal classes for Aquilonians and Cimmerians are Rogue, Priest and Soldier, while Stygians are represented by Rogue, Priest and Mage. Further differences exist within subclasses for each. See the basic breakdown of all three cultures below:', '<u>Aquilonians</u>: Internally divided, but united against their barbarian neighbors, the Aquilonians live lives on the edge. Their kingdom, with its prosperous cities, enlightened culture and religious freedom, is known as the ""Flower of the West."" Yet for all this and despite the power of King, Conan I, it is a land where culture clashes and unrest are always a threat.', '<u>Cimmerians</u>: As the Hyborian Age comes to an end the northern barbarian clans of the Cimmerians know that the end of their time is drawing near too. King Conan I of Aquilonia is himself a Cimmerian, though not typical of his people. Although his life has been filled with wanderlust, his Kin care nothing for what occurs outside their clan territories.', '<u>Stygians</u>: Masters of the magical arts and ruled by their consuming worship of the serpent-god Set, the Stygians excel at occult and diabolic lore. They learned long ago that true power lies in knowledge and in pacts with dark powers. This single-mindedness has allowed them become the only culture to harness the secrets of the Mage class and power that comes with it.', ""<b>Modes Singleplayer as well as Multiplayer</b><br />Unlike most MMORPGs, <i>Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures</i> includes a significant singleplayer experience as well as deep overarching multiplayer gameplay. This is an atypical MMORPG feature, but one that has a purpose. Players enter the game as a lowly galley slave with no memory of his/her past, and over the first five to 20 levels of singleplayer action build the skills necessary to survive in the game's multiplayer levels. During this time you will traverse a variety of rich environments including jungles, deserts, mountains, valleys, dungeons and cities packed with NPCs, beasts and monsters, before eventually leveling up and moving back to your chosen culture?s homeland. Because the only character-related choices that players have to make at the game?s opening are their looks, clothing and culture, this singleplayer mode is important in deciding what class and subclass to pursue and thus the level of impact your character will have in greater multiplayer portions of the game."", 'In-game levels 20 and above are strictly multiplayer. 20-40 introduce players to guilds. 40-60 deal with large scale combat. 60-80 have the player interacting with King Conan and levels 80 and up represent end-game play. Here gameplay changes as social aspects of MMORPG gameplay take over on a large scale.', '<b>Real-time Combat That Takes Queues from the FPS</b><br />Traditionally MMORPGs have utilized a mix of auto and turn-based functionality in their combat systems, but <i>Age of Conan</i> dispenses with that, instead drawing inspiration from FPS/action games. Firmly rooted in the brutality of the <i>Hyborian</i> universe, game developer Funcom has devised an action-based system that not only provides the sense of actually being in the fight, but also requires the player to participate in it. That means no simple targeted attacks. Players can attack and defend from nearly any position in real-time, whether on the ground or atop a mount, while standing still or on the move. It?s a recipe for carnage and one that fits right into the world of Conan.', 'The combat system in <i>Age of Conan</i> comes in three forms: drunken brawling, mini games like CTF and massive Player vs. Player battles, which lets you engage in siege combat to defend or attack a city. All are easy to learn, but difficult to master, providing hours worth of play and replay value and are the core of this new cutting edge MMORPG.', '', '', '']","by
