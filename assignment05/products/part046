Not many aboard survive the crash landing, and those that do find this new world to be one full of strange beauty, but also many dangers. Not only is it full of dangerous wildlife, but it is the setting of a conflict between the ruthless Skaarj and the peaceful natives they have enslaved, the Nali. As one of the surviving prisoners, the player must escape the wreckage of the Rikers, navigate through Nali villages and temples, Skaarj mines and refineries, other crashed ships and many more locations, with the ultimate goal of finding a way off the planet.\n\nUnreal is a first-person shooter. Its story is mostly told through short text messages, deciphered via a translator from computer stations, personal logs, books and signs. The game features a weapon arsenal of ten guns, each with two firing modes. Besides standard pistols, rocket/grenade launchers, miniguns and sniper rifles, there are such items as the Bio Rifle, which fires blobs of toxic waste which stick to walls and enemies, the Flak Cannon, which sprays deadly shrapnel, and the Razorjack, which shoots spinning blades that ricochet off walls. The secondary firing mode might allow a charged shot, sacrifice accuracy for speed, or even make it possible to guide the projectile.\n\nThe game also includes a multiplayer mode. Ten deathmatch maps are available for free-for-all, team deathmatch or a variant called ""King of the Hill"". A special mode is DarkMatch, for which one special map is available. In DarkMatch, the map is without any illumination, and players must use a searchlight to see anything. The deathmatch modes can be played against bots, and the game also offers a cooperative version of the single player campaign.']","by

Or use the Commander alone with your own DC power supply. Because many M.T.H. Proto-Sound 2.0** locomotives can operate on both AC or DC current, the DCS Commander may be the affordable DCS command control option you've been looking for. The DCS commander outputs up to 18 volts of DC power and includes a built-in 5amp resettable breaker making it a perfect solution for small M.T.H. O Gauge layouts exclusively running Proto-Sound 2.0** locomotives. For HO operators, the DCS Commander Controller Set is a perfect power solution for almost any size HO layout. HO operators whose layouts are already outfitted with a DC power supply can choose the individual DCS Commander and plug their existing power supply right into the Commander's power inputs. The DCS Commander offers intuitive control of multiple Proto-Sound engines; for each locomotive, more than 32 functions are available at the touch of a single, clearly-labeled button. In addition to the features available with DCC and analog DC, the DCS Commander unlocks a long list of Proto-Sound operating possibilities.

A secret world that lies beneath all the fighting games, sports games, and that cute little music game you bought last year. That world is the world of fishing games. <P>People have been making fishing games for a long, long time. One of the earliest examples of a fishing game is Fishing Derby for the Atari 2600. Fisherman's Bait, while significantly more complex than Fishing Derby, also takes a stripped-down approach to the world of fishing. But what this arcade port loses in realism, it makes up for in entertainment. <P>There are a few different modes to choose from in Fisherman's Bait. The beginner mode teaches you how to use the game's controls in an easy, well-stocked lake. Training mode lets you pick one of the game's three main lakes and simply fish. Versus mode allows you and a friend to have a fish-off to see who can get the most bass. Tournament mode is the game's main mode. Here, you play through all three of the lakes. Each lake has a qualifying run and an actual tournament. To qualify for the tournament, you must catch a fish that is heavier than the qualification weight. The tournament itself is a ten-minute event. You must catch the three heaviest bass you can find. To catch fish, you've got several lures and several different lake locations to choose from. Knowing which lure to use, how to use it, and where to use it is the key to getting fish to bite, but keeping them on the hook is entirely up to you. Once they're hooked, you've got to reel them in. Usually, there isn't much of a fight, but the huge fish can be really hard to land. As you reel, you've got to watch the tension gauge. If it gets too high, your line will snap and the fish will escape. So as it gets up there, you've got to release the tension and let them run a little bit. After you've tired the fish out, they aren't too hard to land. <P>Since it's an arcade port, you've also got to contend with a separate timer. Each fish you catch gives you a little more time on your game timer. If it runs out, you'll have to use a credit to continue. The options screen lets you set it up for infinite credits, though, so this isn't really a large worry. <P>While Fisherman's Bait is a reasonably fun game, it really isn't worth more than a rental to most. There is, after all, a reason why fishing games have remained a deep, dark secret. However, if you latched onto the arcade version, or if fishing games are just your bag, then by all means, pick it up. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Essentially two separate systems, it is both a game and a scenario designer. Players have a high level of control over units, from company to corps level, with a wide array of command choices. A unique element of the game is its fluid turn system. Instead of fixed phases for movement and combat, players can resolve attacks at any point in their turn, reacting in a more realistic way to situations as they develop. The game has good graphics, although the main map can be difficult to navigate. Units are represented by ""counters"" using standard military symbols, which beginners may find confusing. Scenarios included are World War II, Korea, Middle East and hypothetical East-West conflicts.']",TalonSoft,"['>#117,277 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#16,404 in Video Games > PC Games > PC Games']",,Video Games,B000SMX36I

A number of modes are available for single game players and aerial competition can be played with or against up to three friends. Choose from nine different racers from the BANJO-KAZOOIE universe, a bunch of zany, booby trap loaded tracks with a number of modes including a grand prix and time trial mode. In the tradition of other kart racing games, BANJO PILOT offers classic and uncomplicated fun. What sets BANJO PILOT apart from the rest is that instead of the traditional kart, the player is racing with miniature airplanes. The racing still keeps with the look and feel of a traditional kart, but turning still presents hazards as if on a ground course and powersliding is necessary to make sharp turns. Weapons are accumulated by hitting strategically placed weapon pickups spread around each track. The plane has to be directed higher or lower to avoid obstacles and to pick up weapons. Flying a plane also allows for special use of the L button to perform a barrel roll for weapon pickups or avoiding enemies. Fans of traditional kart games can truly appreciate the traditional feel and unique transportation in BANJO PILOT.']","by

Ultimately, your prowess will lead you to the greatest treasures this civilization has to offer. If that were not enough, your travels are further rewarded by offerings of wisdom; generational secrets that will both soothe and provide wisdom to our overly fast-paced life. \n\nThe Dynasty Adventure on the other hand is like choosing the deluxe sight-seeing tour where you are whisked luxury-style through time. Adventure is full of rewarding experiences and includes 5 unique powerup tiles to help you along your journey. Both game styles offer the same enjoyable characteristics and are designed with \'fun\' and \'relaxation\' in mind.\nStrategy Tips and Tricks\n\nAs in all Mah Jong (or Mahjongg solitaire) games, you are asked to clear the layout by matching \'tile pairs\'. Season (Summer, Winter, Fall and Spring) tiles and the Flowers (Orchid, Plum Blossom, Bamboo, Chrysanthemum) are unique in the game because any Season matches with any Season and any Flower matches with any Flower.\n\nTo select tiles, you may choose free tiles without any obstructing tiles above or beside them (these tiles are called ""free"", as in free to match). If you can\'t find a match, don\'t worry - you will be given an auto hint where two tiles on the board will begin to highlight and animate. When you see 3 of a tile available, choose to remove the pair that uncovers the most tiles - choose wisely.\n\nAs far as strategy goes, the object of the game is to relax and have fun, but if there is one bit of strategic advice to offer this is it: it is best to remove tiles in the tall towers and the long lines first (and when 4 of a tile are available remove all 4 of them to simplify the board and get 500 bonus points!).']",Oberon,"['>#129,593 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#18,454 in Video Games > PC Games > PC Games']",,Video Games,B000UDB41Q

Star Trek: The Next Generation - A Final Unity,,[],"['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['Spectrum Holobyte has done a remarkable job of making a distinctive, enjoyable, and even deep adventure from the exploits of Picard and company. With top notch voice acting, multiple narrative paths, various difficulty settings, challenging puzzles, and gorgeous graphics;\n\nThe Next Generation A Final Unity is subtle and sweeping, bringing in many of the elements that make Star Trek: Judgment Rites such a joy to play. The game opens in the exact fashion as an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation on television (a small touch that makes the game even more immersing). The story begins as the Enterprise finds itself pulled into a dispute between a group of Garidian (friends of the Romulans) political convicts asking for asylum from the Federation and a Garidian warship that is in pursuit. \n\nPlaying out in an episodic format, the story initially unfolds in the form of several mini-adventures which run the gamut from saving a damaged space station to solving a whodunit mystery on a nature preserve planet. It becomes apparent to Picard and his crew that big trouble is afoot in the galaxy. A race against time begins between the Federation, the Romulans, and the Chodak which is an ancient and once powerful race that has ruled the galaxy almost a million years ago but is now thought to be dead. These political powers are trying to locate an ancient artifact of great power known as the Unity Device. It is up to the Starship Enterprise to determine the secret of this device and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. \n\nThe production values of this game are top notch for its time. The film clips are impressive, and a Holodeck feature inside the game allows you to watch cut scenes again and again to your hearts content. The graphics are well drawn, including all the main characters from Star Trek: The Next Generation that have been rendered in almost perfect fidelity compared with their real life counterparts.']","by

Test your skills on six of America\'s greatest fishing lakes, including Lake Wylie, Clear Lake, Lake of the Ozarks, Lake Amistad, Logan Martin Lake, and Lake Okeechobee. You\'ll fish for nine species of monster bass, such as large mouth, small mouth, spotted, striped and more. There are also 14 other trophy species, such as trout, salmon, northern pike, catfish and walleye. Casting the line is initiated by flicking the analog stick or -- for less patient players -- by inputting specific commands to attract fish. Once a fish starts biting, the fight begins. Following the on-screen visual cues, you must carefully balance reeling in the fish while keeping an eye on the line\'s tension so it doesn\'t break. Button combinations can also be used to weaken the fish\'s resolve, allowing for an easier catch. As you progress, additional rods, lures, and live bait become available to improve the odds of landing the ""big one."" Other play options include an Open Fishing mode and a Quick Challenge. The former has you fishing on your choice of lakes, while the latter involves racking up high scores in timed events.  <BR><BR>']","by

Knife Edge: Nosegunner,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Nintendo 64', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['From the Manufacturer\nBlat off for revolutionary game play action with Knife Edhe for N64. Knife Edge combines the intense fast-paced action of sci-fi shoot\'em-up with the thrilling joyride of an arcade-style fight game in 3D.\nReview\nSince it doesn\'t clearly state anywhere on the box, let me make it abundantly clear that Knife Edge isn\'t really a ""fly-around-and-shoot-stuff"" helicopter game. It\'s really just about shooting enemy ships while the computer flies the helicopter around for you. If you can remember Pyramid Patrol or Sewer Shark, you know exactly what kind of game it is: a 3D railed shooter.\nKnife Edge has a incredibly cheesy story to it. Get this. Earth colonies on Mars have been invaded by insidious alien ectoplasm. You, of course, being the gunner of the experimental assault aircraft known as Knife Edge, must shoot \'em all before they take over the planet. How do you this? Simply line up the crosshairs with the enemy on the screen and shoot. Unfortunately, this is pretty much all you really do for six levels (OK, you can fire secondary weapons and dodge enemy fire, too).\n\nVisually, Knife Edge is pretty mediocre. The majority of the game is composed of dark, drab, uninteresting environments and enemies, although admittedly some of the end-level bosses are pretty cool looking. Knife Edge doesn\'t offer much on the audio side either. There are little techno beats and bad sound effects, but no voice-overs or anything especially neat. The only thing about Knife Edge that is sort of cool is its multiplayer mode, in which you can play the missions with up to four people at once. Since the gameplay is so basic, it\'s a perfect game to rent when you have friends and family over who might not be expert gamers.\n\nThe game works well as a rental, but since you can play through it in just a couple hours, I advise against purchasing it outright. The developers tried to extend the game\'s length by adding alternate paths, but it doesn\'t add a lot.', ""Blat off for revolutionary game play action with Knife Edhe for N64.

The Babylon 5 Entertainment Utility includes a screen saver module to provide relief from work, a set of 30 wallpaper images to dress up the desktop, and a utility that links sounds from the show to various Windows functions. Once installed, it turns PCs into a fountain of Babylon 5 action.\n\nThe wallpaper images are stills from the episodes and include various shots of the B5 station itself, its interior, other spacecraft and planets. Most of the sounds are beeps and buzzes from various B5 machines, such as the beep of the hand communicators. There are also samples of music by Christopher Franke -- B5\'s resident composer -- and some laser blasts. A control panel allows users to decide what sound is played when, or to exclude particular applications from making noises. Users can also program up to five different keystrokes to fire off a sound just for the heck of it.\n\nWhile the above features are mainly Windows dressing, the screen saver is what makes the computer come to life. It contains more than 100 images in four categories: Personnel, Ships, Battles and Galactic Data. The first category is simply pictures of the show\'s central characters along with ""vital"" statistics like eye and skin color. The other three often include 5- to 10-second movies of even more space ships flying around and shooting each other.\n\nOverall the program is easy to use.\n\nAnd what great pictures and movies. B5 lovers will revel in the ability to watch some of the best footage from the show, such as the StarFury launch sequence, over and over, soaking up details that often whiz by on television. Having a Vorlon transport as wallpaper also allows painstaking scrutiny. Best of all, the movies can be tied to a keystroke as well, so that when mid-week B5 withdrawal is at its height, the touch of a button brings up all the action and drama.']","by

Samurai Jack was thrust from his era into a dark future where his worst enemy, the wizard Aku, rules the world. You'll help Jack fight through legions of enemies and destroy the evil wizard!"", '', ""Genndy Tartakovsky's Samurai Jack cartoon has a lot of cool things going for it: a unique look, smart stories, good sound design, and tons of action. The Samurai Jack game, however, has none of the above. The conversion of Tarakovsky's two-dimensional characters to three dimensions makes for graphics that look familiar, yet still crappy. Where the show looks lush, the game looks bland. But the graphics aren't the only dull aspect of this title."", 'As with the show, The Shadow of Aku follows Samurai Jack\'s quest to defeat the evil demon Aku by travelling back in time to thwart him before he can rise to power. Before he can head into the past, Jack has to free those Aku has enslaved. In each stage, Jack must seek out caged villagers and ancient relics to earn power-ups. Freeing villagers can earn Jack new swords, while relics can be exchanged for more life, power, or Zen (which allows Jack to enter ""sakai mode"" basically a simplified bullet time). The trouble is that none of these power-ups have any real effect on gameplay. The various swords all appear to dish out basically the same amount of damage.', 'Like most licensed games, The Shadow of Aku is a collect-a-thon with simple combat, basic platforming, and little innovation. This isn\'t a truly bad game, just a very uninspired one. The various combat systems all work perfectly, they\'re just shallow and a bit counter-intuitive. The difficulty level is hilariously low; on the hardest setting, it\'s still a cakewalk, on the lowest, it can be easily completed by someone in a coma. Strangely, young kids don\'t seem to be this title\'s target audience, based on the Teen rating. Overall, The Shadow of Aku comes across as an amazingly generic action title. It\'s a shame, as Samurai Jack is easily one of the most unique cartoons on the air today, so this could have been so much more.<br /><br /><b>Concept:</b><br />Take a Cartoon Network hero, dumb him down, and shove him in a generic third-person action title <br /><br /><b>Graphics:</b><br />The look is pretty faithful to the show, which sadly doesn\'t make for a good-looking game <br /><br /><b>Sound:</b><br />The music, sound effects, and voiceovers are all pretty minimal and forgettable  <br /><br /><b>Playability:</b><br />The slightly bizarre control scheme works just fine, but it isn\'t exactly deep <br /><br /><b>Entertainment:</b><br />Even Samurai Jack fans will find themselves yawning through this one <br /><br /><b>Replay:</b><br />Low <br /><br />Rated: <b>6 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Jeremy Zoss</b><br />Issue: <b>May 2004</b><br /><br /><b>2nd Opinion:</b><br /> Every single one of the four points I\'m giving this game is for the animations seen in sakai mode. Sakai, apparently, makes time slow down and allows Jack to execute some really nice kung fu-inspired moves. But to be kind, the rest of Samurai Jack\'s latest outing is less than inspiring. There are hub worlds. I really thought that we were past all of that sometime back in 2001. I don\'t want my missions doled out by ungrateful villagers in such a predictable and linear fashion. In addition, although the look of the game kind of resembles the show, it ends up just looking gross.<br /><br />Rated: <b>4 out of 10</b><br />Editor: <b>Lisa Mason</b><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"" target=""""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/logos/gi_logo.gif"" border=""0"" /></a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AN45D/"">Subscribe to Game Informer</a> -- <i>Game Informer Review</i>']",Sega,"['>#58,001 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#560 in Video Games &gt; More Systems &gt; GameCube &gt; Games']",$42.65,Video Games,B0001GL084

Some cower in doorways, hoping, no doubt, that the Landers will overlook them. No chance! Look! See that terrified Humanoid wriggling helplessly in the force of the Lander beam? No time to lose! Thrust out and blast that Lander with your laser missiles. There! That got him. Now dive down and catch the Humanoid. Hurry! Hurry! He\'s falling fast!\n\n--From the Atari 2600 Defender instruction manual.']","by

It\'s powered by custom IBM PowerPC-based CPU with three symmetrical cores each running at 3.2 GHz. It also carries a custom ATI graphics processor with 10 MB of embedded DRAM. This is powerful enough to draw 500 million triangles per second. In other words, it makes for great looking games on standard TVs, and even better looking ones on HDTV sets thanks to built-in support for HDTV (720p/1080i/1080p) resolutions.<p/>The unit has a 12x dual-layer DVD-ROM drive, which plays both the game media and progressive-scan DVD movies right out of the box. For game-save and media storage, Xbox 360 Arcade System users can choose to stick with the Memory Unit included with the bundle, or upgrade to either the detachable <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-20GB-Hard-Drive/dp/B000B6ML32/"">20GB hard drive</a> or the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-20GB-Hard- Drive/dp/B000OYKQBU/"">120 GB hard drive</a> (both sold seperately). Along with storing files, the hard drive will make the Xbox 360 backward-compatible with a large part of the existing Xbox game library.<p/><b>Control your Gameplay</b><br/>The Xbox 360 Arcade System comes with one <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-882224022408-Xbox-Wireless-Controller/dp/B000B6MLUA/"">Xbox 360 Wireless Controller</a> with rumble. Xbox 360 uses a refined button layout for its controllers. Back and Start buttons sit at the center of the controller and between them is a new Xbox Guide button, which instantly takes the user to the Xbox 360 user ""Dashboard"" interface. From there, they can check for friends online, access personal digital content like photos songs, and more. The black and white buttons of the first Xbox controllers have been replaced with new shoulder buttons placed above the left and right triggers. The Xbox 360 can accommodate up to four wireless controllers and has three USB 2.0 slots to use for wired controllers or for streaming your digital media from digital cameras, MP3 players, and any Windows XP-based PC. Microsoft has also created a video-conferencing camera, sold separately, that will work with the system.<p/> <b>The Media Experience</b><br/>All Xbox 360 titles can be played in either standard or high-definition resolution in 16:9 widescreen, with anti-aliasing for smoother graphics. Game designers will be able to take advantage of the system\'s multi-channel surround sound. The Xbox 360\'s digital media allows users to supplement any game\'s music from tracks in their own personal library. Five titles are bundled on a single disc included with the Xbox 360 Arcade System. These are:<ul><li><i>Feeding Frenzy</i><li><i>Luxor 2</i><li><i>Boom Boom Rocket</i><li><i>Pac-Man Championship Edition</i><li><i>Uno</i></ul> <b>Go LIVE</b><br/>Xbox 360\'s built-in Ethernet port allows users to connect their system to the Xbox LIVE service via their broadband connection.

With oil from that part of the world no longer available, crude oil prices skyrocket to $800 a barrel. The vast Russian landmass now holds the largest accessible reserves of fossil fuels, making Russia the world\'s primary supplier of energy virtually overnight. With the massive economic boom it receives, Russia quickly re-establishes itself as a superpower and restores her military might. In response most of Western Europe unifies to create the European Federation, a new nation destined to be a formidable 21st-century superpower. But things are also changing across the pond. In 2020, the United States is on the verge of finishing construction on the Freedom Star, a controversial orbital military platform that will upset the balance of world power. The European Federation withdraws from NATO in protest. Tensions between the European Federation, the United States, and Russia are building and will soon reach the breaking point.

Though publicized as an evolution of the European Union, demanding admission criteria disenfranchised all but the wealthiest nations of Europe. The UK and Ireland declined membership (instead joining the New Commonwealth), as did Switzerland (fiercely neutral as always).Consummate professionals, the European Federation Enforcer Corps is made up of veteran elite counter-terrorist and peacekeeping forces from throughout Europe. Calm and precise, these highly-trained and experienced soldiers are especially skilled in urban warfare. They excel in electronic warfare as well as advanced directed energy weapons technology, and have the fastest battlefield vehicles. The Enforcer Corps also have access to the world\'s best ""less than lethal"" weaponry.<p/><table width=""75"" cellpadding=""5"" align=""left""><tr><td align=""center""><img alt=""The United States Joint Strike Force insignia from \'Tom Clancy\'s EndWar\'"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/EW.jsf.75.jpg"" border=""0""></td></tr></table><b>The United States Joint Strike Force</b><br/>Once strong allies with Europe, the U.S. has broken ranks following the dissolution of NATO and the formation of the European Federation. The two superpowers are now locked in a costly and controversial military space race. This rivalry builds to a crescendo when the U.S. prepares to launch the Freedom Star, a huge military space station that Europe suspects could be used to neutralize its missile shield satellites. An evolution of today\'s Marine Expeditionary Units, the Joint Strike Force is known for their integration of air and ground combat capabilities. Epitomizing the saying, \'high speed, low drag,\' these elite soldiers excel in precision firepower and can rapidly deploy anywhere in the world.

Soldier for soldier, no force on the planet can match the Spetsnaz Guard Brigades in terms of raw, brute force. Hardened veterans of Russia\'s many regional conflicts, these troopers are a highly effective, determined, and deadly force.

Virtua Athlete 2000,,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming &amp; Microconsoles', 'Sega Dreamcast']",{},"['Disc(s) only. Ships in generic case. Disc(s) are professoinally cleaned. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', ""Agetec's Virtua Athlete 2000 is a track and field title that aims to wrap new-school presentation around old-school button mashing. The game features seven track and field events, support for four-player simultaneous participation, ten stock characters, a character editor, and modem-based Internet rankings. You can play through all seven events with a world championship-style scoring system in the game's quick tournament mode, or select exhibition mode to vary the difficulty settings and event count.  Should you meet with success, two hidden characters and a number of hidden attributes may be unlocked. While Virtua Athlete 2000's character designs are nothing compared to those of Sega's Decathlete for the deceased Saturn console, all the characters at least have their own unique strengths and weaknesses. The 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 110-meter hurdles, javelin throw, and 1500-meter run are all that stand between you and gold medal glory."", ""Although an offering of seven events doesn't afford much in the way of variety, Virtua Athlete 2000's concise feature list paves the way for surprisingly rich gameplay. There may be only seven events, but each exudes a respectable amount of refinement and quality. To play, most events require you to use the A and X buttons for running and the B button as an action button. The 100-meter dash event, elegant in its simplicity, requires only that you push the A and X buttons as fast as you can. However, by alternating button presses, taking into account your character's innate strengths, and making good use of the B button for a last minute lunge, the tide of the race may vary numerous times over the course of a brief ten seconds. The high jump is another good example of this phenomenon. The first leg requires running via the A and X buttons, the second a jump commenced via the B button, and the third a well-timed leg sweep keyed with the directional pad. Since a dead-center jump isn't optimal for someone leaping in an arc, you must also choose an appropriate takeoff point for your jump as well. Timing is everything, and everything happens in the blink of an eye. Should you exercise good judgment, you can earn up to 1,000 points per event, break a few records, and even earn a few enhancements for your saved character. Add in the fact that characters have their own biases for certain events, and what you have is a track and field title that is simultaneously inviting, deep, and fun."", ""Taking a page from Sega's successful NFL2K and NBA2K releases, Virtua Athlete 2000 delivers fluid polygon graphics with a distinctly broadcast feel. Event camera angles and stadium lighting effects emulate the same viewpoint that lofty, tripod mounted cameras would provide during a televised sports broadcast. As such, the intentionally washed-out stadium and spectator visuals provide striking contrast to the crisply defined athletes in the foreground. Actual character animation, while a bit on the jumpy side, remains fluid throughout. Other than problematic hip joint seams, the 60fps frame rate, realistic motion, and smoothed musculature makes it difficult to believe that Virtua Athlete 2000 is merely composed of polygons. The included plethora of detail touches, such as animated spectators, blowing flags, lounging athletes, and parked duffel bags only serves to enhance this effect. By contrast, the game's sound selection - replete with nondescript grunts, groans, and assorted kitschy studio music - doesn't support the visual experience, but it never really disappoints, either."", ""Overall, Virtua Athlete 2000 is a track and field blockbuster, provided you're a member of its target audience. If you're not a huge fan of the game's seven track and field events or lack human competition to play with, the game will be nothing more than a weekend fantasy. Internet ranking helps, but not greatly.  However, if you have one or two friends to provide constant challenge, or really enjoy the game's included events, Virtua Athlete 2000's longevity will be off the charts. Otherwise, the presentation is solid, the gameplay inviting, and the visuals stellar.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright  2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Eventually, instead of pounding directly on the two buttons (the faster you hit them, the faster your character would run), people started fashioning button-mashing instruments out of things like spoons and pencils. When the home version was released, control pads featuring rapid automatic button pushing were suddenly in style. One Track and Field game has already been released for the PlayStation, but it was released to an audience that really didn't care about the game. Will anyone care this time around? If you're a fan of the Olympics or if you're looking for a fun multiplayer PlayStation game, you definitely should. Track and Field 2000 is simply great fun. Konami did the right thing when it decided to keep the proven button-pounding gameplay that made the series famous. The game features 12 events, including the long jump, cycling, diving, and the hammer throw. With the exception of three events, all of the events are fairly straightforward and test how fast you can actually hit the buttons, your timing, or a mixture of the two. Events such as diving and horse vaulting will take some time to perfect as they require a little more timing-based elements than the other events. Vaulting requires precise timing and precise button pushing. You must jump at the right moment and hit a series of buttons in the correct order with very little time and no room for error.  The gameplay and control, while simple and spelled out on the screen before each event, are extremely involving and addictive. Slamming the buttons as fast as possible and receiving a medal for results is very rewarding. Saving your best times and then trying to beat them is quite fun also. The only problem with gameplay as simple and straightforward as this is that it has an extremely short learning curve and thus a short life. The only thing that keeps the game interesting past the three- or four-day mark is its four-player action via the multitap. The competition between friends is frantically fun since every event is literally exhausting (pounding those buttons takes a little work!), and the results of your skill are spelled out clearly and incontestably. Visually, Track & Field 2000 is quite good. The lifelike animation and detail of the polygonal athletes are the two aspects of the game's graphics that give Track and Field 2000 such a distinctive look. The athletes all have very detailed faces and bodies. The tracks and fields they compete on also look fairly convincing and are filled with cameramen, trainers, and spectators.   In the audio department Track and Field 2000 is adequate. All of the sound effects are fairly accurate, and many of the grunts and yells of the athletes exerting themselves are realistic and sometimes comical. The music is hardly noticeable, which is suiting for a focused competition such as this. The announcer, who belts out the scores and results after each attempt, does the job quite well.   Overall, International Track and Field 2000 is a fun and entertaining game, although its simple gameplay, while addicting at first, has a very short shelf life for a single player. If you're a fan of multiplayer games, this is definitely one to check out.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (GBA),,[],"['Video Games', 'Retro Gaming & Microconsoles', 'Game Boy Advance', 'Games']",{},"[""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 on the Game Boy Advance doesn't look or play quite like its other incarnations but the amount of death--or serious injury--defying tricks you can pull off, and the wild level design, graphics and responsive controls all work amazingly well for the handheld. With an overhead isometric view and its use of only four buttons, Hawk veterans will need to readjust their attack. Still, you'll be amazed at how many tricks have been crammed into this cartridge. For the most part the visuals are clear and detailed with the skaters being incredibly well animated. Gameplay hasn't changed much from before; initially there are six levels available (more are unlocked as a reward) and after picking a skater, you must perform tricks and locate items to earn loot for buying new gear, which will enable you to improve your skater's stats and continue to the next skate park. The game is sadly without some of the cooler features of the big consoles--for example you can't create parks or skaters and multi-play is sorely missed. Nevertheless, the feeling of accomplishment one gets when perfectly landing a stunt is just as satisfying on the GBA as it is on the PS One and Dreamcast versions. Even folks who don't like skateboarding games will think Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is a great (and addictive) achievement for the handheld platform. --Mark Brooks, Amazon.com""]",Activision,"['>#33,496 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#266 in Video Games > More Systems > Game Boy Advance > Games']",,Video Games,B00005JGEU

Unreal Mission Pack - PC,,"['Unreal Mission Pack - PC', 'HardwarePlatform: Pc', 'OperatingSystem: Windows 95']","['Video Games', 'PC', 'Games', '</span></span></span>']",{},"['This software is BRAND NEW. Packaging may differ slightly from the stock photo above. Please click on our logo above to see over 15,000 titles in stock.', 'The difficulty in reviewing a game like Unreal is keeping in mind what has come before it while at the same time allowing the game to flesh out its own sense of style and gameplay. Unreal is not Quake. The look is different. The feel is different. And what gives Unreal an edge is how these differences, while not always positive, distinguish it from the legions of other 3D shooters.', ""In Unreal, you are a prisoner aboard a ship en route to a penal colony. The ship crashes on a mysterious planet where the mystical Nali race is being subjugated by the cruel and technologically advanced Skaarj. As you journey through the many environments on the planet, you must find a means of escape from the planet and help the Nali defeat their oppressors. Unreal intertwines the feel of the medieval Nali architecture and culture with the sci-fi design of the weapons and the Skaarj warriors to create an environment that's a step above other games of its ilk."", ""As far as the game itself, the graphics are incredible. Unreal has the best graphics of any first-person shooter - and possibly of any game - to date. The palette is bright and varied, while the textures are intricate and well defined. The quality of textures deserves high praise - they help create environments that really take hold of you. The levels are so detailed and distinct that it's easy to distinguish one level from all the others, and you won't confuse the prison spacecraft for the Nali village. In conjunction with the graphics, the level design is advanced and complex. The mix of wide-open spaces and cramped hallways is refreshing. As far as graphics go, you just can't beat Unreal's immersion factor."", ""Combining an alien world with weapons that seem alien themselves has produced some interesting results. As varied as the ten weapons are, there's also an alternate method of firing each of them (the 8-Ball Launcher, Unreal's equivalent of a rocket launcher, can also be used as a grenade launcher). This wide range of attack styles will undoubtedly produce higher degrees of strategy in deathmatch play. As for single-player, the weapon placement and location was spaced out evenly, and finding ammunition was not a daunting task."", ""One of Unreal's best features is the enemy AI. In other games, the logic of certain creature actions seems to be linear and undefined. In Unreal, each opponent attacks with its own style, using a combination of melee and ranged attacks. One of the most impressive experiences (if not the most aggravating) was seeing a well-placed rocket shot miss because a Skaarj dodged it at the last second. Another eye-catching sight was watching different enemies power up shields to protect themselves in the midst of battle."", ""As far as problems go, there are some, but they don't hurt gameplay enough to reduce the overall experience. The first is that there are too few enemy model types. Unreal has only six main enemy models, but the design team has done a pretty good job of using different skins to create a variety of opponents. In addition, there are other models for the random critters that you fight throughout your adventuring."", ""Another complaint deals with the pace of gameplay. Sometimes the pace of action seems too stretched out, and it feels as if each battle is just the same as the last. However, these gaps were few, and for the most part the game pacing and plot development were enjoyable. On the puzzle-solving side, there isn't much to be had; most of the game you simply push buttons to open a path leading to the next level. But your actions involving them are well integrated into the plot. There are few complex puzzles to solve; it's doubtful that Unreal would benefit from more in that area."", ""Lastly, the weapons are pretty cool, but there's no simplicity in design. Each gun takes some practice to understand its use and benefits, but in the end, you spend too much time learning. Rather than give you instinctual weapons (like a basic shotgun or machine gun), Unreal's unusual weaponry forces you to adjust the way you play, without much added benefit of weapon ferocity or visceral gratification."", ""If you're looking to hone your deathmatch skills, however, you're going to find playing online to be next to impossible. The developers have stated in the readme.txt file that the game is still in the tweaking phase as far as Internet play is concerned. But with seemingly boundless game customizability options as well as in-package deathmatch levels, Unreal gives you everything you need to practice for the big time. It even gives you a choice of bots designed by Steve Polge to test your mettle. This was probably one of the most enjoyable features, and after you've finished the game you can go in and set up your own games for a single-player deathmatch experience."", ""Unreal is a truly great single-player game. It's hard to say whether it will stand the test of the first-person action-shooter wars and become a classic in and of itself. It will definitely have to overcome the lack of a decent Internet experience if it wants to obtain any more accolades, but, apart from that, it offers as much as you could possibly want from a game in this genre. <i>--Tahsin Shamma</i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Initially, the farm is small, but as the game progresses and the player interacts with more and more animals, the farm will grow.

A paranormal investigator by trade, Carnby is looking for answers to the strange events and horrific creatures reported in and around the park, but gets more than he bargained for when all the mysteries and terrors of the park spill out over the course of one apocalyptic night. It?s the player?s task to avoid the new frightening dangers of the park as you search for the answers to what these supernatural occurrences mean and why they are happening.<p/><b>Gameplay Based on Full Player Immersion</b><br/>Packed full of action and vivid in its realism <i>Alone in the Dark</i> goes to the extreme to keep players engaged and immersed by plunging them into the heart of the action in real-time at every turn and challenging them to survive using full movement control. The goal here is to allow players to do or at least feel that they can do more or less whatever is possible in real life, within the game.<p/>Need to avoid a blast of steam or an eruption of fire that has shot up in your path? You can simply side-step it or you can handle the obstacle with a little more panache by using the environment around you, for example by swinging around it using reachable pipes or wires. In another situation you may be challenged by attacking monsters. No problem. You can take the path of least resistance, again by side-stepping them or placing an obstacle between yourself and them, but if you are feeling like taking out a little aggression you can pick up a board, chair, box, etc. and have at it. Nearly anything that you come across that would be usable in real life is usable in game and can be wielded in several different ways.<p/>In addition, game developer Eden Studios has done away with a few in-game conventions in favor of real life upgrades. Instead of old-fashioned health bars <i>Alone in the Dark</i> uses realistic body damage and physiological effects to show players how much damage has been done to Carnby by the new dangerous nightlife of Central Park. Basically this means if Carnby has been taking a licking he?s going to be a little bloody. Monsters use sensory perception of all kinds to find their victims, so players need to keep aware of Carnby?s physical state, as well as the impact he has on his surroundings. Also gone are traditional inventory systems that take players out of the game while you switch or check items in your possession, replaced by an in-game inventory system where items are carried in the folds of Carnby?s trench coat. This allows you to stay in the action the whole time. Sticking with the realism theme, the number of items that Carnby can carry is limited, but since ingenuity is built into the system, items can be combined or their uses altered, mostly with tape, so players can adjust as challenges arise.<p/><b>TV Style Intensity That Keeps You Hooked</b><br/>Built around a unique television style episodic narrative game structure, the storyline of <i>Alone in the Dark</i> is split into a number of distinct 30-40 minute episodes, doled out one at a time as you play. This new way to progress through the storyline ensures that players can enjoy the game regardless of the amount of time they have available without ever feeling lost. Each time a saved game is launched, the episode will begin with a video summary of the previous episode to quickly re-immerse the player in the story, removing the need to remember where you were or what you were doing at the end of your last play session. In addition, every episode will also close with a nail-biting, cliff-hanger ending to rattle players? nerves. And when you choose to leave the game, a video teaser of the next episode will play to leave players always wanting more.<p/><b>Vivid Photographic Rendering</b><br/>Even on a bad day, and this will be a bad one, Central Park and New York City are something to see. With Game developer Eden?s proprietary Twilight technology and rendering engine, players can expect to see everything from the City?s famous landmarks to the manifestations of the evil that have been festering in Central Park come to life as if you were there. This lavishly detailed game world takes advantage of highly realistic and advanced cinematographic effects including depth of field, camera focus, numerous light sources, moisture, reflections and High Dynamic Range effects.<p/>Whether it?s the innovative game play, the unique episodic game structure, the advanced physics or the return of a ground-breaking protagonist recast in the modern era, <i>Alone in the Dark</i> holds something for players willing to take on the mysteries and dangers at the heart of Central Park.<p/>']","by

Gotcha the Sport is a capture-the-flag style game played with paintball guns. Your mission is to get through the level, capture the enemy flag by shooting it, and return it to your base. All while trying not to get shot by the other team, or run out of ammo.\n\nGraphically, I would have to say Gotcha was designed and implemented fairly well. The backgrounds and characters are detailed and well-drawn, and the animation is clean. The real disappointment here is that they only bothered to make three levels, which loop indefinitely. This detracts a bit from replay value.\n\nThe sounds and music in Gotcha the Sport are nothing special, you might end up muting this one after a while.\n\nDirections:\nGotcha is one of the few Light Gun games which allows you to control where you move as targets present themselves. This requires a bit of ambidexterity when holding a controller in one hand and a Zapper in the other, but using the mouse actually makes it easier.\n\nGetting the flag and making it back home gives you something to do besides just endlessly shoot up the other team, which adds significantly to the fun of the game.']",LJN,"['>#18,865 in Video Games (See Top 100 in Video Games)', '>#130 in Video Games > More Systems > Nintendo NES > Games']",$9.04,Video Games,B00115L8AO
